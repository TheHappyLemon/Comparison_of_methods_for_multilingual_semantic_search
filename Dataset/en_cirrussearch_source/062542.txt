One kilometer north is the site of the notable Lernantsk Caravanserai, appearing east of the road like a half-buried Quonset hut. It was built at approximately the same period as Orbelian's Caravanserai, which is also located near the village, but Lernantsk Caravanserai is smaller in size and more crudely built. Four kilometres north are the ruins of Kapuyt Berd ("Blue Fortress"). Orbelian's Caravanserai Scenery Inside Orbelian's Caravanserai Scenery Statistical Committee of Armenia.
