Raí Souza Vieira de Oliveira (born 15 May 1965), known as Raí (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʁaˈi]), is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. Raí played with Brazil for more than a decade, helping the country win the 1994 World Cup. He spent the better part of his 15-year career with São Paulo and Paris Saint-Germain, winning 10 major titles with the two teams combined, and nearing the 100-goal mark. He is considered by fans, journalists and players as the greatest legend of Paris Saint-Germain despite his relatively short period at the club. He is the younger brother of more famous Brazilian footballer Sócrates. Born in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Raí started his career with local Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP), signing in 1986 with Associação Atlética Ponte Preta, with which he made his Série A debuts.[citation needed] Raí joined São Paulo FC for the 1987 season, only making his league debut on 18 October due to injury. He only scored once in his first year but, following the arrival of Telê Santana as coach, blossomed into a prolific scorer, scoring 28 overall in the 1991 campaign as the team won both the regional Campeonato Paulista and the National Championship.[citation needed] In 1992, Raí was part of the São Paulo team that won the club's first ever Copa Libertadores, scoring the only goal of the final second-leg against Newell's Old Boys that took the match to a penalty shootout.[citation needed] Later that year, he was instrumental in the defeat of FC Barcelona in the 1992 Intercontinental Cup, netting both goals in a 2–1 win in Tokyo. This form saw Raí named South American Footballer of the Year for 1992.[citation needed] In the 1993 season, São Paulo defended their Copa Libertadores title, with Raí again scoring in the final as CD Universidad Católica were beaten 5–1 at the Estádio do Morumbi. In June 1993, Raí was acquired by Paris Saint-Germain F.C. of France for US$4.6 million, remaining with São Paulo until the end of the year. He still managed to contribute with six goals in 28 Ligue 1 games as his new club won the national championship for the second time in its history; he helped PSG to the following season's French Cup, and was on target in the League Cup final against SC Bastia (2–0). He also reached the semi-finals of the 1994–95 UEFA Champions League with PSG. Raí once again proved essential as the capital outfit won the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, scoring twice in a 3–1 home win against Parma, after a 1–0 away loss. He also appeared in the final against SK Rapid Wien, and went on to score three seasons in double digits during his five-season spell. In 1997–98 he scored in both the Coupe de la Ligue final and the Coupe de France final against Bordeaux and Lens respectively as PSG won both games. At the age of 33, Raí returned to São Paulo.[citation needed] He retired in 2000. Raí gained the first of his 49 caps for Brazil in 1987, whilst at São Paulo, being selected to that year's Copa América in Argentina, playing twice – including in the 0–4 group stage loss against Chile – in an eventual group stage exit. His debut occurred on 19 May at the Rous Cup, playing 15 minutes in a 1–1 draw against England.[citation needed] Raí was picked by coach Carlos Alberto Parreira for his 1994 FIFA World Cup squad. He captained the team in the group stage and scored a penalty in the first match, a 2–0 win against Russia, after Romário was brought down in the box. Raí was subsequently dropped from the first team in the knockout stages, with Dunga taking over the captaincy. He was used as a substitute against the Netherlands (quarterfinals, ten minutes) and Sweden (semifinal, 45 minutes) as the national team went on to win the tournament. Raí's older brother, Sócrates, was also a footballer and an attacking midfielder. He too represented Botafogo de São Paulo in his career, and was also a longtime Brazilian international. After retiring, Raí became a social activist and justice campaigner, being involved in two separate philanthropic organisations.
