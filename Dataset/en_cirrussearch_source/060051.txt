The 2022 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Beijing, China, from 4 to 20 February. A total of 2,871 athletes from 91 nations participated in 109 events in seven sports across 15 disciplines. Overall 29 nations received at least one medal, and 23 of them won at least one gold medal. Athletes from Norway won the most medals overall, with 37, and the most gold medals, with 16. The latter record was the highest gold medal tally at a single Winter Games. Host nation China won nine gold medals surpassing its gold medal tally of five during the 2010 winter edition. Athletes from that nation also won 15 medals overall, which eclipsed its record of 11 at both the 2006 and 2010 winter editions. Biathletes Johannes Thingnes Bø, Quentin Fillon Maillet, and Marte Olsbu Røiseland, and cross-country skier Alexander Bolshunov won the most total medals at the games with five each. Bø also earned the most gold medals with four. Snowboarder Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand won the first Winter Olympic gold medal for that nation. Germany achieved a podium sweep in the men's two-man bobsleigh competition with Francesco Friedrich and Thorsten Margis winning gold, Johannes Lochner and Florian Bauer earning silver, and Christoph Hafer and Matthias Sommer attaining bronze. The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. Two bronze medals were awarded to Daniela Maier and Fanny Smith for a third-place tie in the freestyle women's ski cross event following a decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.   *   Host nation (China) On 29 January 2024, CAS disqualified Kamila Valieva for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021 for an anti-doping rule violation. On 30 January 2024, the ISU reallocated medals in the figure skating team event to upgrade the United States to gold and Japan to silver while downgrading ROC to bronze. 2022 Winter Paralympics medal table List of 2022 Winter Olympics medal winners Kesting, Amanda (4 February 2022).
