National coach of Poland in 2010–2014 and Turkey since 2016. He has been a FIDE Senior Trainer since 2012. Krasenkow has made major contributions to several areas of opening theory, most notably in the Classical King's Indian Defense. His consistent use of the relative sideline 5.h3 in that opening helped to establish it as a viable manner of combating the King's Indian. Other members of the elite now use the system from time to time, including on occasion Magnus Carlsen. It is typically called the Makogonov system, though some authors now refer to it as the Krasenkow System; he himself calls it the Bagirov system. Another important contribution is the so-called Groningen Attack in the English Opening (discovered simultaneously with Vadim Zviagintsev): 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.g4!? Krasenkow has written several books on chess openings and middlegames: The Open Spanish. London, Cadogan Books, 1995 The Sveshnikov Sicilian. London, Cadogan Books, 1996 Finding chess jewels.
