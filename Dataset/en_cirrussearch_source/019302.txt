Färjestad Bollklubb (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈfæ̌rjɛsta]; abbreviated as FBK) is a Swedish professional ice hockey team based in Karlstad. Färjestad has had 21 Swedish Championship final appearances, winning ten times since the Swedish Hockey League (SHL; formerly Elitserien) was started in 1975, making them the most successful SHL club in history. The team plays in the highest Swedish league, and have done so since 1965. Following Brynäs IF's relegation to HockeyAllsvenskan in 2023, Färjestad is the only team to have constantly played in the current top tier of Swedish hockey, the SHL, since it was started in 1975. They reached the SHL championship finals six years in a row between 2001–2006, winning the championship two times. They are featured rivals with Djurgårdens IF, Frölunda HC, and HV71. Färjestad BK was founded on 10 November 1932 at Håfström Kiosk in the district of Färjestad in Karlstad by Sven Bryhske, Gösta Jonsson, Sven Larsson and Erik Myren. Initially the association's main sport was bandy, which is still reflected in the full name of the club. Ice hockey was first included in 1956. In 1965, Färjestad were promoted to the top division (at that time Division 1 Southern) which they succeeded in winning for the first time in 1973. During the 1974/75 season, Färjestad qualified for the first season of Elitserien, and have since never been relegated. In 2014, Färjestad BK played in the 2014 AHL All Star Game in St. John's, Newfoundland against a team of AHL All Stars. In the skills contest, Färjestad lost 18-17 against the All Stars on a Tuesday evening at Mile One Center. In the AHL All-Star Game, Färjestad lost again to the AHL All Stars 7-2 with a sold out crowd the following evening. This is a partial list featuring the past five seasons.
