Caleb Ewan (born 11 July 1994) is an Australian road and track bicycle racer who rides for UCI WorldTeam Team Jayco–AlUla. A sprinter, Ewan has a style similar to that of Mark Cavendish, taking an extremely low position that offers him an aerodynamic advantage. Caleb Ewan was born in New South Wales to a Korean mother and Australian father. At the age of eight he started bicycle racing, inspired by his father, who was also a competitive cyclist. He started competitive cycling at the age of ten.[citation needed] In 2010 he became the Junior National Road Race Champion. The next year he won multiple disciplines at the Junior National Track Championships and he became World Champion omnium at the Junior Track World Championships. In 2013 Ewan started racing for Jayco-AIS World Tour Academy. That year he won the first stage as well as the general classification of the Mitchelton Wines Bay Cycling Classic. He also won the La Côte Picarde instalment of the UCI Nations Cup U23, the Gran Premio Palio del Recioto, and stages in the Tour Alsace, Thüringen Rundfahrt der U23 and the Tour de l'Avenir. At the end of the year he finished fourth in the Men's under-23 road race at the 2013 UCI Road World Championships. Ewan signed pre-contract terms with Orica–GreenEDGE in October 2013, joining the World Tour team as a stagiaire in August 2014 and as a professional in October. At the beginning of August, before joining Orica–GreenEDGE, Ewan took part in the road race at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, competing for Australia. The Australian team tried to control the race for Ewan's sprint, but were unable to do so. After attempting a solo chase of the three leaders, he fell back and was the last man to finish: he finished in 12th place out of 140 who started, over 11 minutes behind the gold medallist Geraint Thomas (Wales). His first professional wins came in the second and third stages of the 2015 Herald Sun Tour. A month later, in the Tour de Langkawi he then took his second professional win and the lead in general classification. Though he lost the overall lead of the race, Ewan won a second stage (the third victory of his career) and the points classification. He was named in the start list for the 2015 Vuelta a España, where he won stage 5, but he withdrew from the race during stage 10. In 2016, Ewan participated in the Tour Down Under and won the first stage in a mass sprint. He made it a duo of wins by taking the sixth stage as well. He also was the victor of Stage 2 of the Herald Sun Tour, another race held on Australian soil. He was named in the start list for the 2016 Giro d'Italia. He raced in the 2017 Giro, winning stage seven in a field sprint. In the 2019 Tour Down Under, he headbutted Jasper Philipsen in Stage 5 and was relegated to 83rd place after crossing the finish line first. In July 2019, he participated in the Tour de France, and in Stage 11 he beat Dylan Groenewegen in a tight sprint finish in Toulouse. He won stage 16 in Nîmes, narrowly beating Elia Viviani, as well as the final stage, narrowly beating Groenewegen on the Champs-Élysées. He was the "lanterne rouge" of the 2022 Tour de France, having finished over 5 hours down on overall winner Jonas Vingegaard.
