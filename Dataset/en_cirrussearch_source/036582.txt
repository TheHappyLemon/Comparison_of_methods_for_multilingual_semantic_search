BDO LLP is a partnership of chartered accountants in the United Kingdom. In November 2018, BDO and Moore Stephens announced plans to merge their UK businesses, putting BDO ahead of Grant Thornton as the fifth-largest accountancy firm in the UK. The deal was completed in February 2019. The firm was founded in 1903 as Stoy and Co by Fred Stoy. In 1919, Jack Hayward joined the firm and it became Stoy Hayward and Co. A series of mergers with Finnie and Co in 1992 and the BDO Binder Hamlyn offices that did not join Arthur Andersen or Deloitte & Touche in 1994 created BDO Stoy Hayward, which became the UK member of BDO International. The firm became a limited liability partnership in 2004. The names 'Stoy Hayward' were dropped in October 2009, adopting the worldwide branding of BDO. BDO Stoy Hayward was criticised in their role as administrators for the collapsed Christmas hamper savings company Farepak. BDO Stoy Hayward used an 0870 premium rate phone service to provide information for victims of Farepak's collapse in 2006. They were initially also accused by The Observer of taking a share of the call revenue to pay for the administration; this accusation was later withdrawn. In September 2008, Andrew Caldwell, valuations partner at BDO Stoy Hayward, was appointed independent valuer for the stricken mortgage bank, Northern Rock plc. The UK government nationalised Northern Rock in February 2008, and the legislation effecting the nationalisation required an independent valuer to ascertain the value of the business at the point of nationalisation. The role is a controversial one, as the legislation specifies in some detail the basis of valuation, and shareholder action groups claim that the valuation basis has been designed to minimise the compensation due.
