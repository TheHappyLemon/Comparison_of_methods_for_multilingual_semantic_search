Tímea Babos (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈtiːmɛɒ ˈbɒboʃ]; born 10 May 1993) is a Hungarian professional tennis player who is a former world No. 1 in doubles. She is a four-time Grand Slam champion in women's doubles, having won the 2018 and 2020 Australian Opens, as well as the French Open in 2019 and 2020, all alongside Kristina Mladenovic. The pair also finished runners-up at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships, 2018 US Open and 2019 Australian Open, and Babos reached the final of the 2016 Wimbledon Championships with Yaroslava Shvedova. In mixed doubles, she has reached two major finals, at the 2015 Wimbledon Championships with Alexander Peya, and the 2018 Australian Open partnering Rohan Bopanna. Babos became world No. 1 for the first time in July 2018, holding the top ranking for 13 weeks, and was the first Hungarian player, male or female, to reach world No. 1 in either singles or doubles. She has won another 20 doubles titles on the WTA Tour, including the 2017, 2018 and 2019 WTA Finals and two at WTA 1000 level. In singles, Babos has a career-high ranking of No. 25, achieved in September 2016, and has won three titles on the WTA Tour, also finishing runner-up on five occasions. She has represented Hungary in Fed Cup and Billie Jean King Cup since 2011, and also competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games. Tímea Babos was born on 10 May 1993 to mother Zsuzsanna and father Csaba in Sopron, Hungary. She has an older sister. Coming from a sporty family, Babos decided to follow her family tradition. Her father is a coach at the tennis club her family owns in Sopron, while her mother is a housewife. Her sister was also a very good player and won NCAA titles when studying at Berkeley in the United States. She was originally a swimmer and was national champion in Hungary, but during that time she looked differently at swimming, finding it quite boring and as hard work, so she started to come with her sister to tennis practice at the age of 8. Originally, she started playing tennis just for fun, but then her dad saw her talent, so she started to concentrate more on it and eventually stopped swimming. She loved watching her sister's workouts with their father, when she was eight and her sister 16, so her parents signed her up for a class at a local club and after a few months, she was accepted into local events. Her breakthrough came at the age of nine, where after leading the u12 club team to four qualification round victories, she qualified for the u12 National Championships. A few weeks later, she won her first Hungarian National Championship title. At 15, she travelled to the United Kingdom to practice owing to her homeland's lack of sufficient facilities. One of the opportunities was practice on hardcourts; her country mostly has clay courts. Two years after her arrival in England, she got a good sponsorship deal, which meant she could return and train in Budapest. Babos reached a career-high ranking of No. 2 as a junior. She began competing on the ITF Junior Circuit in September 2006 at the age of 13, winning the title in her debut event in doubles at the lowest-level Grade-5 Talentum Cup in homeland Hungary. There, she also made her singles debut but lost in the second round. By the end of the year, she didn't play at any tournament. But she then continued her success in doubles, winning the following tournament, the Grade-5 Mostar Open in April 2007. In the second half of the year, she won Grade-3 Budaörs Cup and then Grade-2 TrueVisions Thailand Open, both in doubles. The following year, she made a progress, reaching the semifinal in singles and final in doubles event at the Grade-1 Barranquilla Junior Tennis Tournament Country Club.

Babos then made her major debut at the junior 2008 French Open, reaching the second round in both singles and doubles. At Wimbledon, she lost in the first round, but made it to the quarterfinals in doubles. In August, she played at the Canadian Open Junior Championships, reaching quarterfinals in singles and final in doubles. On her debut at the US Open, she reached only the first round in singles and second round in doubles. At her last tournament of the 2008 season, she reached singles quarterfinals and title in doubles at the Grade-A Osaka Mayor's Cup. Babos started to produce strong results at the junior Grand Slam and other Grade-A and Grade-1 events in 2009. She started year with great performances at the Grade-1 tournaments. She won both singles and doubles title at the Copa Gatorade in January and at the Sarawak Chief Minister's Cup in March.

At the 2009 French Open, she managed to get to her first Grand Slam final in doubles event.

The following week, she played on another $10k event in the United Kingdom, and won her first title. Babos continued winning one and losing two $10k finals, by the end of the 2009 season. She had a strong start in doubles too, winning one of two finals that she reached on the ITF Circuit.

Tímea Babos has become the first Hungarian female tennis player to reach the world number one spot. She enjoyed watching Elena Dementieva growing up. Her comment stated: I really liked her style of play and, although she never won a Grand Slam, she was always at or near the top and also won the Olympics. She didn't seem arrogant and was always nice to the junior players at Grand Slams. Despite being so successful she seemed to be a nice person. — Babos, on Dementieva In an interview with Mancunian Matters, she noted that she is supporter of Manchester United, as well as her whole family. Babos has aggressive style of play with a good mix of shots. During time she developed her game and now she is capable of throwing some nice variations with slices and drop-shots, as well as using her doubles skills to take the net often, trying to reach winners as much as possible. Her father taught her not to be aggressive player nor defensive but neutral one, where she can hit slice and drop shots sometimes. Because of her height and power, her biggest strength is her serve, which really helps when she is playing on faster courts like grass or indoor hard. She grew up playing on clay. Tímea Babos has plenty of sponsors. She has taken part in the MOL Talent Support Programme since 2008, and then in 2011, she became a participant in the MOL professional sponsorship programme. She uses VCORE-98 Racquet by Yonex. In 2016, she signed Sponsorship Agreement with Fila, previously having endorsement deals with Adidas and K-Swiss, that did not last long.
