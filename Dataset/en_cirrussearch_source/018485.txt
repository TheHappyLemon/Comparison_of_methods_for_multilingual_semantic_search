USA-241, also known as SBIRS GEO-2, is a United States military satellite and part of the Space-Based Infrared System. The SBIRS satellites are a replacement for the Defense Support Program early warning system. They are intended to detect ballistic missile launches, as well as various other events in the infrared spectrum, including nuclear explosions, aircraft flights, space object entries and reentries, wildfires and spacecraft launches. SBIRS-GEO 2 was manufactured by Lockheed Martin Space and is built upon the A2100M satellite bus. SBIRS GEO-2 was launched on 19 March 2013 from Cape Canaveral, atop an Atlas V launch vehicle. In October 2013, the satellite was incorporated into the United States early warning network. Spaceflight portal "SBIRS GEO-1, -2, -3, -4". Gunter's Space Page. 4 November 2020.
