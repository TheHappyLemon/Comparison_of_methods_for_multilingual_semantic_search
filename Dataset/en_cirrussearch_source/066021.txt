Jan Douglas Bergqvist (born 29 March 1993) is a Swedish professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Czech First League club Karviná. Born in Stockholm, Bergqvist moved with his family to England when he was seven years old. He played youth football with Reading and Queens Park Rangers, before joining Aldershot Town in 2009. Bergqvist eventually became youth team captain at Aldershot, and spent loan spells at both Thatcham Town and Dorchester Town, before making his senior debut for Aldershot in May 2011. He joined Farnborough on loan in August 2011, and Basingstoke Town in October 2012. Bergqvist signed for Exeter City in June 2013, before moving on loan to Welling United a few days later, for the whole of the 2013–14 season. On 10 February 2014, Bergqvist left England to return to Sweden, signing a two-year contract with Östersund on a free transfer. He did so as part of a scheme called 'League Football Education' which aims to obtain contracts abroad for players in the English league system, alongside Andrew Mills and Jamie Hopcutt. On 27 March 2019, Bergqvist joined Eliteserien side Haugesund on loan until 31 July with an option to make the deal permanent. In February 2020 he moved to Polish club Arka Gdynia. After playing in Sweden with Kalmar FF, he signed for Ukrainian club Chornomorets Odesa in January 2022. He returned to Kalmar FF on loan in March due to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. After the loan spell ended he moved to Latvian club Riga FC. In July 2023 he signed for Degerfors. On 2 March 2024, Bergqvist signed a contract with Czech First League club Karviná.
