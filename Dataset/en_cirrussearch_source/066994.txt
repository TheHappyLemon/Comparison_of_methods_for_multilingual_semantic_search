Progress MS-23 (Russian: Прогресс МC-23), Russian production No.453, identified by NASA as Progress 84P, was a Progress spaceflight launched by Roscosmos to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). It was the 176th flight of a Progress spacecraft. The Progress-MS is an uncrewed freighter based on the Progress-M featuring improved avionics. This improved variant first launched on 21 December 2015. It has the following improvements: New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites. Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers. First time installed on Progress MS-03. Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism. Improved Micrometeoroid (MMOD) protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment. Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations. GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination. Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station. New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations. Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS) replaces previous Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V as the Progress spacecraft's on-board radio and antenna/feeder system. Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system. A Soyuz-2.1a with Progress MS-23 to the International Space Station from Baikonur Site 31 launched on 24 May 2023 at 12:56 UTC supporting Expedition 69 and Expedition 70 missions aboard the ISS. It docked the same day. The MS-23 cargo capacity is approximately 2,500 kg (5,500 lb) as follows: Dry cargo: 1,290 kg (2,840 lb) Fuel: 499 kg (1,100 lb)–600 kg (1,300 lb) Oxygen: 40 kg (88 lb) Water: 630 kg (1,390 lb) Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station Krebs, Gunter (1 December 2015).
