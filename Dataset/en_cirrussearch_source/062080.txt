Mtskheta-Mtianeti (Georgian: მცხეთა-მთიანეთი, literally "Mtskheta-Mountain Area") is a region (Mkhare) in eastern Georgia comprising the town of Mtskheta, which serves as a regional capital, together with its district and the adjoining mountainous areas. The western part of the region, namely the entire Akhalgori Municipality, is controlled by breakaway South Ossetia since the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. The Mtskheta-Mtianeti region officially comprises five municipalities, yet only four are effectively under Georgian authority: Subdivisions of Georgia South Ossetia's status is disputed. It considers itself to be an independent state, but this is recognised by only a few other countries. The Georgian government and most of the world's other states consider South Ossetia de jure a part of Georgia's territory. With the formation of mkhare (regions) in 1995, Akhalgori was officially classified as part of the Mtskheta-Mtianeti region. Since the 2008 Russo-Georgian War the Georgian central government lost effective controle over Akhalgori. "Regions and municipalities of Georgia" (in Georgian). Georgian Government.
