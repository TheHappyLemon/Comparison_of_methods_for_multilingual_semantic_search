Agrostemma is a genus of annual plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, containing the species known as corncockles. Its best-known member is A. githago, the common corncockle, which is a native of Europe. The species is a weed of cereals and other crops, probably with a centre of origin in the eastern Mediterranean. It occurs as a weed worldwide, but is declining in its native range because of improved seed cleaning.[citation needed] Agrostemma gracile, the slender corncockle, is only found in central Greece near the city of Farsala. Corncockle is an attractive plant, and its seeds are still commercially available to gardeners.
