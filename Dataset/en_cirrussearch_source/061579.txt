At the hospital, she is told her unborn child has died and, to prevent septicaemia, she should have an operation urgently. However, without funds or insurance, they cannot afford treatment. The couple seek desperately to raise the necessary funds before it is too late. The film is played by a cast of non-professional actors re-enacting an episode from their own lives.
