Anne Voase Coates OBE (12 December 1925 – 8 May 2018) was a British film editor with a more than 60-year-long career. She was perhaps best known as the editor of David Lean's epic film Lawrence of Arabia in 1962, for which she won an Oscar. Coates was nominated five times for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing for the films Lawrence of Arabia, Becket (1963), The Elephant Man (1980), In the Line of Fire (1993) and Out of Sight (1998). In an industry where women accounted for only 16 per cent of all editors working on the top 250 films of 2004, and 80 per cent of the films had absolutely no women on their editing teams at all, Coates thrived as a top film editor. She was awarded BAFTA's highest honour, a BAFTA Fellowship, in February 2007 and was given an Academy Honorary Award, which are popularly known as a Lifetime Achievement Oscar, in November 2016 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Coates was born in Reigate, Surrey, England, the daughter of Kathleen Voase (née Rank) and Major Laurence Calvert Coates. Her first passion was horses. As a girl, she thought she might become a race-horse trainer. Coates attended the Reigate village school called the Micklefield School. She then attended High Trees School in Horley (Surrey). Her final school was Bartrum Gables in Broadstairs (Kent). Before becoming a film editor, she worked as a nurse at Sir Archibald McIndoe's pioneering plastic surgery hospital in East Grinstead, England. Coates became interested in cinema after seeing Wuthering Heights (1939) directed by William Wyler. She decided to pursue film directing and started working as an assistant at a production company specializing in religious films (also doing projectionist and sound recording work). There she fixed film prints of religious short films before sending them to various British church tours. This splicing work eventually led to the rare job as an assistant film editor at Pinewood Studios, where she worked on various films. Her first experience was assisting for film editor Reggie Mills. Coates later worked with film director David Lean on Lawrence of Arabia. She had a long and varied career, and continued to edit films, including Out of Sight and Erin Brockovich (both for Steven Soderbergh). Coates was a member of both the Guild of British Film and Television Editors (GBFTE) and American Cinema Editors (ACE). Variety's Eileen Kowalski noted "many of the editorial greats have been women: Margaret Booth, Dede Allen, Verna Fields, Thelma Schoonmaker, Anne V. Coates and Dorothy Spencer." Coates was at the centre of a film industry family. Besides being the niece of J. Arthur Rank, she was married to the director Douglas Hickox for many years. Her brother, John Coates, was a producer (The Snowman and Yellow Submarine). Her sons, Anthony Hickox (1959-2023) and James Hickox (b. 1965) were film directors. Her daughter Emma E. Hickox (b. 1964) is a film editor. Coates died on 8 May 2018, aged 92, at the Motion Picture Country Home and Hospital, Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, United States. "In a way, I've never looked at myself as a woman in the business. I've just looked at myself as an editor. I mean, I'm sure I've been turned down because I'm a woman, but then other times I've been used because they wanted a woman editor." "...I guess I've been lucky that most of the time I've been in the same direction as the director. I try to work with directors whose work I like and find interesting. When I was younger, I had to find work where I could, and I had some not great experiences with directors." "You have the courage of your convictions. When you're editing you have to make thousands of decisions every day and if you dither over them all the time, you'll never get anything done." "I seem to get the rhythm from the performances. I like to feel I'm very much an actor's editor. I look very much to the performances and cut very much for performances rather than the action. I think that's important, what's in the eyes of the actor." 1947: The End of the River – second editor (uncredited) 1949: The History of Mr. Polly – assistant editor (uncredited) 1952: The Pickwick Papers 1953: Grand National Night 1954: Forbidden Cargo 1955: To Paris with Love 1956: Lost 1957: The Truth About Women 1958: The Horse's Mouth 1960: Tunes of Glory 1961: Don't Bother to Knock 1962: Lawrence of Arabia 1964: Becket 1965: Young Cassidy 1965: Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines 1966: Hotel Paradiso 1968: Great Catherine 1970: The Adventurers 1971: Friends 1972: Follow Me! 1972: A War of Children 1973: Bequest to the Nation 1973: Catholics 1974: 11 Harrowhouse 1974: Murder on the Orient Express 1975: Man Friday 1976: Aces High 1976: The Eagle Has Landed 1978: The Legacy 1980: The Elephant Man 1981: The Bushido Blade – supervising editor with Yoshitami Kuroiwa 1981: Ragtime 1983: The Pirates of Penzance 1984: Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes 1986: Lady Jane 1986: Raw Deal 1987: Masters of the Universe 1989: Lawrence of Arabia – editorial consultant 1989 reconstruction and restoration of 1962 film 1989: Farewell to the King 1989: Listen to Me 1990: I Love You to Death 1991: What About Bob? 1992: Chaplin 1993: In the Line of Fire 1994: Pontiac Moon 1995: Congo 1996: Striptease 1997: Out to Sea 1998: Out of Sight 2000: Erin Brockovich 2000: Passion of Mind 2001: Sweet November 2002: Unfaithful 2004: Taking Lives 2006: Catch and Release 2007: The Golden Compass 2010: Extraordinary Measures 2015: Fifty Shades of Grey 1963: Academy Awards, Academy Award for Best Film Editing for Lawrence of Arabia 1965: Academy Awards, Academy Award for Best Film Editing (nominee) for Becket 1981: Academy Awards, Academy Award for Best Film Editing (nominee) for The Elephant Man 1994: Academy Awards, Academy Award for Best Film Editing (nominee) for In the Line of Fire 1999: Academy Awards, Academy Award for Best Film Editing (nominee) for Out of Sight 2017: Academy Awards, Academy Honorary Award aka Lifetime Achievement Award 1975: BAFTA Awards, BAFTA Award for Best Editing (nominee) for Murder on the Orient Express 1981: BAFTA Awards, BAFTA Award for Best Editing (nominee) for The Elephant Man 1993: BAFTA Awards, BAFTA Award for Best Editing (nominee) for In the Line of Fire 2001: BAFTA Awards, BAFTA Award for Best Editing (nominee) for Erin Brockovich 2007: BAFTA Fellowship 1963: American Cinema Editors, ACE Eddie for Best Edited Feature Film (nominee) for Lawrence of Arabia 1965: American Cinema Editors, ACE Eddie for Best Edited Feature Film (nominee) for Becket 1994: American Cinema Editors, ACE Eddie for Best Edited Feature Film (nominee) for In the Line of Fire 1995: American Cinema Editors, Career Achievement Award 1997: Women in Film Crystal Award, International Award 1998: American Cinema Editors, ACE Eddie for Best Edited Feature Film (nominee) for Out of Sight 1999: Online Film Critics Society Award, Best Film Editing (nominee) for Out of Sight 2012: Motion Picture Editors Guild, best edited films of all time for Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and Out of Sight (1998) "BFI biodata".
