Rolf Sørensen (born 20 April 1965) is a former Danish professional road bicycle racer. He is currently working as a cycling commentator and agent. Born in Helsinge in Denmark, Sørensen moved to Italy at the age of 17, where he has lived since. He goes under the name Il Biondo due to his blonde hair. Sørensen won such classic one-day races as the Tour of Flanders, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Paris–Brussels, Paris–Tours and Milano–Torino, as well as slightly smaller races like the Coppa Bernocchi (twice), and the Rund um den Henninger Turm or Grand Prix Frankfurt. He has led the UCI Road World Cup on several occasions, finishing third in 1989 and 1991 and second in 1997 after a broken foot kept him from scoring points in the last two World Cup races of the season. Sørensen also won individual stages in the 1994 and 1996 Tour de France, and wore the yellow jersey as the leader of the race after the team time trial in 1991, won by his Italian team Ariostea. He kept it until he broke his collar bone in a fall four days later. Rolf Sørensen participated in the Tour seven times, the last in 2001. He has also won a number of stages in other stage races, among them stage 9 of the 1995 Giro d'Italia, three stages in the Tour of the Basque Country, six stages in Tirreno–Adriatico, two in the Tour de Suisse, and two in the Tour de Romandie. Sørensen also claimed the silver medal at the 1996 Olympics. For many years Sørensen denied that he used performance-enhancing drugs, but more than a decade after the end of his career as a professional cyclist he admitted using EPO, and to some extent, Cortisone. He broke the news to Danish TV2 on March 18, 2013. 1986 1st Points classification Danmark Rundt 9th Milan–San Remo 1987 1st Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Grand Prix Pino Cerami 2nd Overall Danmark Rundt 1st Young rider classification 3rd Overall Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 1988 1st Gran Premio Città di Camaiore 2nd Overall Danmark Rundt 1st Points classification 1st Young rider classification 2nd Züri–Metzgete 2nd Rund um den Henninger Turm 3rd Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 3rd Giro dell'Emilia 3rd Grand Prix Pino Cerami 8th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 1989 1st Stage 3 (TTT) Giro d'Italia 1st Coppa Bernocchi 1st Giro dell'Etna 2nd Coppa Ugo Agostoni 3rd Gent–Wevelgem 4th Tour of Flanders 4th Züri–Metzgete 9th Rund um den Henninger Turm 1990 1st Overall Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 1st Paris–Tours 1st Trofeo Laigueglia 2nd Coppa Bernocchi 6th Züri–Metzgete 6th Tre Valli Varesine 7th Milano–Torino 1991 Tour de France 1st Stage 2 (TTT) Held after Stage 2-5 1st Stage 9 Tour de Suisse 2nd Milan–San Remo 3rd UCI Road World Cup 3rd Tour of Flanders 3rd Liège–Bastogne–Liège 5th Giro di Lombardia 1992 1st Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Stage 3 1st Paris–Brussels 5th Giro di Lombardia 7th Rund um den Henninger Turm 9th Milano–Torino 10th Milan–San Remo 1993 1st Liège–Bastogne–Liège 1st Milano–Torino 1st Rund um den Henninger Turm 1st Coppa Bernocchi 1st Stage 7 Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Stage 9 Tour de Suisse 1st Stage 3a Three Days of De Panne Tour de Romandie 1st Stage 1, 2 & 6 2nd Overall Tour of the Basque Country 5th Milan–San Remo 6th La Flèche Wallonne 1994 Tour de France 1st Stages 3 (TTT) & 14 1st Paris–Brussels 1st Trofeo Laigueglia 6th Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 6th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 1995 1st Stage 9 Giro d'Italia 2nd Overall Three Days of De Panne 2nd Milano–Torino 3rd Paris–Brussels 4th Giro di Lombardia 5th Giro dell'Emilia 8th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 9th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 1996 1st Stage 13 Tour de France 1st Overall Ronde van Nederland 1st Stage 4 1st Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 1st Stage 7 Tirreno–Adriatico 2nd Overall Danmark Rundt 2nd Road race, Olympic Games 3rd Rund um den Henninger Turm 9th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 9th Paris–Brussels 9th De Brabantse Pijl 1997 1st Tour of Flanders 1st Prologue Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Stage 3b Three Days of De Panne 2nd UCI Road World Cup 3rd Züri–Metzgete 4th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 6th Paris–Roubaix 8th Milan–San Remo 10th Amstel Gold Race 1998 1st Overall Ronde van Nederland 2nd Overall Danmark Rundt 4th Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Stage 5 4th Overall Three Days of De Panne 6th Paris–Roubaix 1999 2nd Overall Danmark Rundt 1st Stage 1 4th Overall Three Days of De Panne 7th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 2000 1st Overall Danmark Rundt 3rd De Brabantse Pijl 8th Milan–San Remo 8th Paris–Tours 2001 4th Tour of Flanders 10th Milan–San Remo 10th Paris–Roubaix 2002 6th Tour of Flanders "Rolf Sørensen admits to doping in the 1990s". 18 March 2013.
