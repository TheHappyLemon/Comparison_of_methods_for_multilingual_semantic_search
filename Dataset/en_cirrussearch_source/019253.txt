Setúbal (/səˈtuːbəl/, US also /-bɑːl/, Portuguese: [sɨˈtuβal, -βɐl] ; Proto-Celtic: *Caetobrix) is a city and a municipality in Portugal. The population of the entire municipality in 2014 was 118,166, occupying an area of 230.33 km2 (88.9 sq mi). The city itself had 89,303 inhabitants in 2001. It lies within the Lisbon metropolitan area, about 50 kilometres (31 miles) from Lisbon downtown by road. In the times of Al-Andalus, the city was known as Shaṭūbar (Andalusian Arabic: شَطُوبَر [ʃeˈtˤuːbɑr]), after the old pre-Roman name of Cetobriga. In the 19th century, the port was called Saint Ubes in English, and Saint-Yves in French. The municipal holiday is 15 September, which marks the date in 1860 when King Pedro V of Portugal officially recognised Setúbal as a city. The city of Setúbal is located on the northern bank of the Sado River estuary, approximately 48 kilometres (30 miles) south of Portugal's capital, Lisbon. It is also the seat of the Setúbal District and formerly in the historic Estremadura Province. In the beginning of the 20th century, Setúbal was the most important center of Portugal's fishing industry, particularly specializing in processing and exporting sardines. None of the many factories then created are operating today. However, the existing maritime ports, either traditional, commercial and the new marines, keep the city's links to the ocean and water well alive and vibrant. Tourism, based on the beautiful natural conditions plus excellent hotels, resorts and infrastructures, is one of the city's most appreciated resources, due to its interconnection with the Sado (river) on one side and Atlantic Ocean on another, having a coast line with both. The city is also connected with the nearby coast of the Arrábida hills natural park - which offers an unspoiled nature and beautiful beaches to the Atlantic Ocean. A dolphin colony inhabits the Sado River. Across the river on the south bank lies the peninsula of Tróia, a place with vast white/golden sand beaches where several luxury hotels and resorts were recently built. The Tróia peninsula can be sighted from the city, across the river. Albarquel, Figueirinha, Galápos, Galapinhos, Creiro and Portinho da Arrábida are some of the city's many beaches, located in the north bank of the estuary, at the very beginning of the Arrábida hills. In antiquity the city was known as Cetobriga, a Turdetani settlement that came under Roman control in the province of Lusitania. The main historical monument of the city of Setúbal is the Monastery of Jesus, which is a 15th- and 16th-century church that represents one of the first buildings in the Portuguese late Gothic style known as Manueline. Also of interest are the São Julião Church, also with Manueline portals. The Castelo de São Filipe, is a 16th- and 17th-century fortress on the north bank of the Sado river, overseeing the city. The fortress was converted into a luxury hotel (pousada). Teatro Animação de Setúbal is based in Setúbal.
