"High and Dry" and "Planet Telex" are songs by the English rock band Radiohead. They were released as a double-A side single from Radiohead's second album, The Bends (1995), on 27 February 1995. "High and Dry" was recorded as a demo during the sessions of Radiohead's first album, Pablo Honey (1993), and remastered for inclusion on The Bends. It is credited as an influence on the bands Travis and Coldplay. "Planet Telex" developed from studio experimentation with drum loops. Two music videos were produced for "High and Dry". The Radiohead songwriter, Thom Yorke, performed an early version of "High and Dry" with another band, Headless Chickens, while attending the University of Exeter in the late 1980s. He said the lyrics were about "some loony girl I was going out with", but became "mixed up with ideas about success and failure". In 1993, Radiohead recorded a demo version at Courtyard Studios, Oxfordshire, with their live engineer, Jim Warren. They dismissed it as "too Rod Stewart". The demo was rediscovered and remastered for inclusion on their second album, The Bends (1995). In 2006, Yorke said that Radiohead's record label at the time, EMI, had pressured him to release it and that it was a "very bad" song. Radiohead wrote and recorded "Planet Telex" in a single session at RAK Studios while working on The Bends. It developed from experiments with a drum loop taken from another song, the B-side "Killer Cars", to which Radiohead added piano processed with multiple delay effects. The band had recently returned from a restaurant, and Yorke recorded the vocals drunk, slumped in a corner. According to the producer, John Leckie, "We had the whole thing down within a couple of hours, which was really refreshing and fun to do." The original title was "Planet Xerox", but Radiohead were denied permission to use the Xerox trademark. The first music video for "High and Dry" featured Radiohead performing at the Vasquez Rocks outside Los Angeles. For the American market, Radiohead's American record label, Capitol, commissioned a new video inspired by the 1994 film Pulp Fiction, set in a roadside diner. After MTV objected, the video was edited to remove a shot of an exploding car. Pitchfork credited "High and Dry" and another Bends song, "Fake Plastic Trees", for influencing the "airbrushed" post-Britpop of Coldplay and Travis. The Irish Times said that "High and Dry" had "essentially invented Coldplay". "New Releases: Singles" (PDF). Music Week. 25 February 1995. p. 43. Retrieved 27 June 2021.
