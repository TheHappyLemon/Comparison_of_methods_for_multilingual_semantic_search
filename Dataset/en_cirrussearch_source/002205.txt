She had her best ever global level performance in Doha at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships, running 4:09.81 for seventh place in the 1500 m final. However, she tested positive for pseudoephedrine at the championships as a result of having taken an over-the-counter medicine to treat a cold. She received a ban for three months – a light sentence to reflect the low-level seriousness of the drug and that she had not ingested the substance for competitive reasons.
