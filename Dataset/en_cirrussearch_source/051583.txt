Veniamin Veniaminovich Alexandrov (Russian: Вениамин Вениаминович Александров; 18 April 1937 – 6 November 1991) was a Soviet ice hockey player who played in the Soviet Hockey League. He played for CSKA Moscow. He was inducted into the Russian and Soviet Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963. After playing exhibition matches in North America in 1957, Alexandrov was put on the negotiation list of the Chicago Black Hawks, a team in the National Hockey League. While Soviet players were not expected to be able to move to North America, Chicago still felt highly enough of him to do so in the event that changed. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2007. Martin, Lawrence (1990). The Red Machine: The Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada's Game. Toronto: Doubleday Canada. pp. 25–26. ISBN 0-385-25272-2.
