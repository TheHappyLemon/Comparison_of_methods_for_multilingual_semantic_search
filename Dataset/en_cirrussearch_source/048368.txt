Lake Malawi is an English-language Czech indie pop band from Třinec, formed in 2013. It currently consists of lead vocalist, guitarist, and keyboardist Albert Černý, and bassist and keyboardist Jeroným Šubrt. The band was formed by Černý following the breakup of his former group, Charlie Straight. Their debut EP, We Are Making Love Again, was released in 2015 and followed by the album Surrounded by Light in 2017. They represented the Czech Republic in the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest with the song "Friend of a Friend", finishing in eleventh place. In 2022, they released their second album, The Great Video Game Crush. Lake Malawi was founded by singer Albert Černý following the breakup of his former band, Charlie Straight, in September 2013. The band's name is inspired by the Bon Iver song "Calgary", from their 2011 self-titled album. Lake Malawi released their debut single, "Always June", in 2014, performing it live on BBC London. That year, the band played at the Czech music festivals Colours of Ostrava and Rock for People as well as the Great Escape Festival in the UK. A year later, they issued their debut EP, We Are Making Love Again. They opened for several notable acts performing in Prague, including the Kooks, Mika, and Thirty Seconds to Mars. In 2016, drummer and former Charlie Straight member Pavel Pilch left the band and was replaced by Antonín Hrabal. In 2017, Lake Malawi self-released the studio album Surrounded by Light. It produced two singles: the title track and "Paris", both of which charted on the Rádio – Top 100 in the Czech Republic. Lead guitarist Patrick Karpentski left the band in late 2017. In 2019, it was announced that Lake Malawi were taking part in the Czech national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, with the song "Friend of a Friend". The track later won the national selection and represented the Czech Republic in the contest. After performing sixth in the first semi-final, the band qualified for the final, where they finished in eleventh place, with 157 points.
