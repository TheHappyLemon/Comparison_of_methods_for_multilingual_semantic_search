Cox made his directorial debut in the "Gray Matter" episode of the hit HBO prison drama series Oz (2000). His first foray into executive production was in The Escapist (2008). He also served as executive producer in the series From Now (2020-2021) and is set to executive produce Mending the Line. He has received numerous accolades including two British Academy Scotland Awards, an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and two Olivier Awards. He has received two Olivier Awards for his performances in Rat in the Skull (1984), and Titus Andronicus (1988). For his role as Logan Roy in the HBO drama series Succession he has received a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Golden Globe Award and nominations for three Primetime Emmy Awards and a British Academy Scotland Award. Cox is divorced from both his first wife, Lilian Monroe-Carr, and his second wife, Caroline Burt. Cox and Burt have two children, Margaret and Alan; the latter is also an actor, best known for his roles in Young Sherlock Holmes, and as the young John Mortimer in the television film of his play A Voyage Round My Father (1982) opposite Laurence Olivier. Cox married his third wife, actress Nicole Ansari, in 2002. They have two sons, Orson Jonathan Cox and Torin Kamran Cox, and live in New York City. Cox also maintains a home in Primrose Hill, London. Cox is a self-proclaimed democratic socialist and a Scottish republican. In 2007, he campaigned for the Scottish Labour Party in the run-up to that year's Scottish Parliament election. However, Cox endorsed the Scottish National Party (SNP) in the 2011 Parliament election because of their higher education policy. In 2020, Cox told Labour strategist Alastair Campbell that he was an active and committed Labour supporter all his life until the party's controversial decision under then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to involve the UK in the Iraq War. On 25 May 2012, he spoke in support of Scottish independence at the Yes Scotland campaign, claiming to have become disillusioned by New Labour under Blair and Gordon Brown, although Cox could not vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum due to his residence in the United States. On 29 January 2015, Cox announced he had quit the Labour Party, believing it had failed to live up to its basic principles in recent years, and joined the SNP, whom he felt was taking forward values of social justice and representing Scotland's best interests. In January 2020, Cox called for a second referendum on Scottish independence, saying Labour had "failed" in Scotland and that the Scottish people were "organically" moving towards a decision to leave the UK following Brexit. In October 2020, he acknowledged that he was unlikely to ever return to living in Scotland, citing the weather. In November 2022, Cox insisted that he did not consider himself a Scottish nationalist and described himself as an Anglophile, but believed too many political decisions were being made on Scotland's behalf. Cox also said he favoured a move towards federalism and constitutional change in the United Kingdom over Scottish independence, commenting, "I don't want to break up the Union but I want another idea for the Union", which he described as "independent states but we come together as a united federation". In October 2022, Cox criticised Conservative Party politician Liz Truss in the wake of the September 2022 United Kingdom mini-budget. Cox asserted the Conservatives had "no vision" and that he did not believe Truss "is the right person for the job". Truss resigned as Prime Minister later the same month. During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, Cox signed his name in support of "A Letter Against Apartheid" written by six Palestinian artists. After the Israel-Hamas war broke out in October 2023, Cox signed another letter (Artists4Ceasefire) calling for a ceasefire. Later, he recorded himself reading the poem "If I Must Die" by Refaat Alareer, a writer and professor killed by an Israeli airstrike during the war. Cox revealed in an interview to The Guardian that he supported the recreational use of cannabis: "It's absolutely great and I recommend it to everyone—get stoned!" On 31 December 2002, Cox was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours List. In 1993, he was made an Honorary Doctor of Laws Honoris Causa by the University of Dundee. In 2006, he was conferred an Honorary Doctorate of Drama by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. In July 2007, he was made an Honorary Doctor of Letters by Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh, and was made an Honorary Doctor of Drama by Napier University in Edinburgh in July 2008. In November 2011, he was named an Honorary Doctor of Letters by Kingston University in southwest London for his tireless contributions to drama education. In February 2010, Cox was elected as the 12th Rector of the University of Dundee by its students, was formally installed in October, and was re-elected in January 2013. In December 2018 he was appointed head of the international jury at the Golden Unicorn Awards. Cox has written three books, including an autobiography, Putting the Rabbit in the Hat. He was honoured at the 2004 BAFTA Scotland Awards with an Outstanding Achievement Award, and at the 2004 Great Scot Awards with a Lifetime Achievement Award. Cox is a patron of the Scottish Youth Theatre, Scotland's national theatre "for and by" young people. Scottish Youth Theatre's building in Glasgow, The Old Sheriff Court, named their theatre the Brian Cox Studio Theatre in his honour. He is also a patron of "THE SPACE", a training facility for actors and dancers in his native Dundee, and an ambassador for the Screen Academy Scotland, a collaboration between Napier University and the Edinburgh College of Art. Cox is also patron of The Old Rep Theatre in Birmingham, one of the first repertory theatres to be built in the UK. In October 2017, he was made an honorary patron for Capital Theatre's campaign to modernise the historic King's Theatre Edinburgh and preserve it for future generations. In January 2020, he was removed from patronage of the Mid-Lin Daycare Centre, a centre for the elderly in Dundee, after serving for four years due to his confession of his use and endorsement of recreational cannabis. In April 2020, he became patron of the British American Drama Academy with whom he has had a decades-long association, including directing several collaborations with the Moscow Art Theatre and holding regular Masterclasses for participants on BADA's programs. In April 2010, Cox, along with Ian McKellen and Eleanor Bron, appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. All three actors gave their time free of charge. In 2012, Cox became the Grand Marshal of the New York City Tartan Day Parade and reprised the role in 2020, the first time a previous Grand Marshal was asked to return since the parade moved to Manhattan's Sixth Avenue. In June 2005, he was awarded the first Scotland's Tartan Day International Ambassador Award at a ceremony in the Scottish Parliament for his work in promoting Scotland abroad. He has authored three books: Salem to Moscow: An Actors Odyssey, The Lear Diaries, and his autobiography Putting the Rabbit in the Hat. Salem to Moscow: An Actors Odyssey spans 30 years in British theatre, beginning in the 1980s, when Cox, despite success on both sides of the Atlantic, was looking for a new sense of purpose for his life and work which culminates having first directed The Crucible at the Moscow Art Theatre School. In The Lear Diaries, Cox accounts how a group of leading actors approach a major text, providing insight into the pressures that contemporary theatre actors face. He describes the emotional and physical difficulties that came with playing King Lear while also working as a member of an ensemble playing roles in Richard III. His diary also reveals the personal strains of touring, particularly the difficulties of being separated from his family during the company's year-long tour. Cox credits a remark from fellow actor Oliver Cotton during the production as resulting in the title of his autobiography Putting The Rabbit In The Hat published in 2021.
