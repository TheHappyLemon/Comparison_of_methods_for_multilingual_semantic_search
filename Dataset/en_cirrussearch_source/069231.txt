Himamaylan (/hiːmɑːˈmaɪlən/), officially the City of Himamaylan (Hiligaynon: Dakbanwa/Syudad sang Himamaylan; Filipino: Lungsod ng Himamaylan), is a 3rd class component city in the province of Negros Occidental, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 116,240 people. This component city located is 75 kilometres (47 mi) south of Bacolod, the provincial capital. Due to its coastal location, it is a rich source of different types of seafood, mainly fish, oysters, mussels and shrimps. The city celebrates the Himaya-an Festival every April 14–25. Himamaylan became a city on March 5, 2001, through a proclamation by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo under Republic Act No. 9028. It is the only city in the 5th District of the province. During the Spanish colonisation, it was once spelt as "Gimamaylan". In 1795, Himamaylan became the capital of Negros. At that time, the city served as a garrison for occupying Spanish forces. Today, the old Spanish-built fort constructed as a lookout point for frequent Moro raids is one of the historical attractions found in the city. In 2001, the Philippine Congress passed Republic Act No. 9028, providing for the conversion of the municipality into a city after a favourable plebiscite. Himamaylan is located at the centre-most cove on the coastline of Negros Island. Himamaylan has a natural harbour characterised by deep waters favourable to access by marine vessels.
