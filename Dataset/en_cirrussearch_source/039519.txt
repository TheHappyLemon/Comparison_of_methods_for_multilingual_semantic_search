Zdice is a town in Beroun District in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 4,200 inhabitants. Villages of Černín and Knížkovice are administrative parts of Zdice. Zdice is located about 8 km (5 mi) southwest of Beroun and 31 km (19 mi) southwest of Prague. It lies mostly in the Hořovice Uplands, including the built-up area. The northwestern part of the municipal territory extends into the Křivoklát Highlands and Křivoklátsko Protected Landscape Area, and includes the highest point of Zdice, which is the hill Kalce at 505 m (1,657 ft) above sea level. The town is situated at the confluence of the Litavka River and the Červený Stream. The first written mention of Zdice is from 1148. It was probably founded in 1039. Until 1302, it was owned by the bishopric in Prague, then it was joined to the town of Beroun. In 1357, the village was merged with the newly established Karlštejn estate, owned by the royal chamber. During the rule of King Sigismund, Zdice was annexed to the Točník estate, to which it belonged until 1607. From 1607 until the establishment of an independent municipal administration after 1848, the village belonged to the Králův Dvůr estate. In the second half of the 19th century, Zdice was industrialised and the population grew. In 1872, Zdice was promoted to a market town. In 1994, it became a town. Until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary, in the Hořovice district, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia. The D5 motorway from Prague to Plzeň and the Czech-German border passes through the town. The Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary was built in the Baroque style in 1747–1749. It replaced an old Gothic church. A valuable building is the town hall. It is a historical house, rebuilt into its current Neoclassical form in the second half of the 18th century. Gothic barrel vaults are preserved in the basement. Josef Vorel (1801–1874), priest and composer "Population of Municipalities – 1 January 2023". Czech Statistical Office. 2023-05-23.
