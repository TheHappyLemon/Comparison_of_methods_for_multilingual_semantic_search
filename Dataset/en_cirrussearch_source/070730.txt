S/2021 J 3 is a small outer natural satellite of Jupiter discovered by Scott S. Sheppard on 12 August 2021, using the 6.5-meter Magellan-Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. It was announced by the Minor Planet Center on 19 January 2023, after observations were collected over a long enough time span to confirm the satellite's orbit. S/2021 J 3 is part of the Ananke group, a cluster of retrograde irregular moons of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Ananke at semi-major axes between 19–22 million km (12–14 million mi), orbital eccentricities between 0.1–0.4, and inclinations between 139–155°. It has a diameter of about 2 km (1.2 mi) for an absolute magnitude of 17.2. "MPEC 2023-B39 : S/2021 J 3". Minor Planet Electronic Circulars. Minor Planet Center. 19 January 2023.
