The Sweden men's national ice hockey team (Swedish: Sveriges herrlandslag i ishockey) is governed by the Swedish Ice Hockey Association. It is one of the most successful national ice hockey teams in the world and a member of the so-called "Big Six", the unofficial group of the six strongest men's ice hockey nations, along with Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia and the United States. The team's nickname Tre Kronor, meaning "Three Crowns", refers to the emblem on the team jersey, which is found in the lesser national coat of arms of the Kingdom of Sweden. The first time this emblem was used on the national team's jersey was on 12 February 1938, during the World Championships in Prague. The team has won numerous medals at both the World Championships and the Winter Olympics. In 2006, they became the first team to win both tournaments in the same calendar year, by winning the 2006 Winter Olympics in a thrilling final against Finland by 3–2, and the 2006 World Championships by beating Czech Republic in the final, 4–0. In 2013 the team was the first team to win the World Championships at home since the Soviet Union in 1986. In 2018, the Swedish team won its 11th title at the World Championships. In 2021 Sweden failed to reach the playoffs for the first time after the tournament implemented the playoff system, placing 9th, tying their 1937 team for their worst placement in tournament history. 1976 – 4th 1981 – 5th 1984 –  Silver 1987 –  Bronze 1991 – 4th 1996 –  Bronze 2004 – 5th 2016 –  Bronze 1921 –  Gold 1922 –  Silver 1923 –  Gold 1924 –  Silver 1932 –  Gold 1931 – 6th place 1935 – 5th place 1937 – 9th place 1938 – 5th place 1947 –  Silver 1949 – 4th place 1950 – 5th place 1951 –  Silver 1953 –  Gold 1954 –  Bronze 1955 – 5th place 1957 –  Gold 1958 –  Bronze 1959 – 5th place 1961 – 4th place 1962 –  Gold 1963 –  Silver 1965 –  Bronze 1966 – 4th place 1967 –  Silver 1969 –  Silver 1970 –  Silver 1971 –  Bronze 1972 –  Bronze 1973 –  Silver 1974 –  Bronze 1975 –  Bronze 1976 –  Bronze 1977 –  Silver 1978 – 4th place 1979 –  Bronze 1981 –  Silver 1982 – 4th place 1983 – 4th place 1985 – 6th place 1986 –  Silver 1987 –  Gold 1989 – 4th place 1990 –  Silver 1991 –  Gold 1992 –  Gold 1993 –  Silver 1994 –  Bronze 1995 –  Silver 1996 – 5th place 1997 –  Silver 1998 –  Gold 1999 –  Bronze 2000 – 7th place 2001 –  Bronze 2002 –  Bronze 2003 –  Silver 2004 –  Silver 2005 – 4th place 2006 –  Gold 2007 – 4th place 2008 – 4th place 2009 –  Bronze Roster for the 2023 IIHF World Championship.
