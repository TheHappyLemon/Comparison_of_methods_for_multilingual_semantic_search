Svitlodarsk (Ukrainian: Світлода́рськ, IPA: [s⁽ʲ⁾w⁽ʲ⁾itɫoˈdɑrsʲk]; Russian: Светлодарск) is a city in Bakhmut Raion, Donetsk Oblast, eastern Ukraine. The city has a population of 11,127 (2022 estimate). It is an industrial town, built as the home for the Vuhlehirska power station. During the war in Donbas that began in 2014, the city was near the frontline with the separatist Donetsk People's Republic. Because of the conflict, the number of residents shrank to a few thousand by 2015. In 2016, it was the site of the bloody battle of Svitlodarsk. It was a city of district significance until that designation was abolished in 2020. On 24 May 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the city was captured by Russian forces as part of the battle of Donbas.
