Gerard Theodor Hubert Van Innis (24 February 1866 – 25 November 1961) was a Belgian competitor in the sport of archery, he competed in two Summer Olympics 20 years apart and came away with six gold medals and three silver medals.

When he was 13 years old he won the first prize in a main competition Antwerp. He also won the prize in 1893, 1894, 1895 and 1896. In 1881 he won the royan prize of Roozendaal.
