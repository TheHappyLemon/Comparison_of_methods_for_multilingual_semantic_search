On March 9, 2020, Dawson endorsed the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders, whom she had also previously endorsed in his 2016 bid. Dawson is involved with the Lower East Side Girls Club and supports other charities such as environmental group Global Cool, One Campaign, Oxfam, Operation USA, Amnesty International, Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), the International Rescue Committee, Voto Latino, and Stay Close.org, a poster and public service advertising campaign for PFLAG, where she is featured with her uncle Frank Jump.

In March 2019, Dawson confirmed that she was in a relationship with US Senator Cory Booker. Their relationship ended in February 2022. In 2018, Dawson made a post to Instagram that was widely perceived as her coming out as queer; when asked about this in a 2020 interview, she stated that this had not been her intention, and further specified that although "People kept saying that I [came out]... I didn't do that, ... I mean, it's not inaccurate, but I never did come out. I mean, I guess I am now ... I've never had a relationship in that space, so it's never felt like an authentic calling to me." A representative of Dawson later clarified to The Daily Beast that she meant to say she came out as an ally of the LGBTQ community. Portals:  Puerto Rico  Biography List of Puerto Ricans "Monitor".
