Kyjov is located about 17 kilometres (11 mi) north of Hodonín. Most of the municipal territory lies in the Kyjov Hills, only a small northern part lies in the Chřiby highlands. The highest point is the hill Lenivá hora at 463 m (1,519 ft) above sea level. The town is situated in the valley of the Kyjovka river. The first written mention of Kyjov is from 1126. Until 1539, it was a property of the Hradisko Monastery. In the 12th century, a Romanesque church and new market place were established here. In 1201, Kyjov is first referred to as a market town. In 1284, King Wenceslaus II allowed to fortify the market town. Kyjov had no funds for the stone walls and built only wooden palisades. Due to financial difficulties of the monastery, in the 14th and 15th centuries, Kyjov was pawned to various lower nobles. In 1515, Kyjov became a town. The monastery sold the town in 1539. After it changed its owners few times, in 1548, Kyjov became a royal town, received a royal promise not to be sold or pawned again, and gained an advantageous position that led to further development. The town had repaired buildings, had built three town gates and new Renaissance town hall, and acquired new properties. In 1710, the first Capuchins came to Kyjov. They had built a new church. In 1784, the Capuchin monastery was abolished. From 1784 to 1848, the town was in good economic condition and expanded. In the second half of the 19th century, Kyjov has a German speaking minory, which included Jewish population.
