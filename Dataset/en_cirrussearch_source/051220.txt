The Battle of Reichenberg took place during the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years' War) on 21 April 1757 near the town of Reichenberg (Czech: Liberec) in Bohemia. Marshal von Bevern had entered Bohemia with a corps of 15,000 Prussians. At Reichenberg he encountered Königsegg's Austrian corps. The full Austrian corps consisted of 18,000 infantry and 4,900 cavalry, but only about 14,000 of them had been concentrated at Reichenberg. The experienced Bevern defeated his opponent. As a result, Bevern captured large quantities of Austrian supplies and could continue his march on Prague.
