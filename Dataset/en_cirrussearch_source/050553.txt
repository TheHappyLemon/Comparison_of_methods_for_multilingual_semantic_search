Ivan Dmitrievich Barbashev (Russian: Иван Дмитриевич Барбашёв; born 14 December 1995) is a Russian professional ice hockey forward for the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League (NHL). Barbashev was selected by the St. Louis Blues in the second round, 33rd overall, of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. Born and raised in Russia, Barbashev started playing hockey there before moving to North America in 2012, where he joined the Moncton Wildcats of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). He spent three seasons in the QMJHL before making his professional debut in the AHL, and made his NHL debut in 2017. Internationally, Barbashev has played for the Russian national junior team at several tournaments, winning a silver and bronze medal in consecutive World Junior Championships. Barbashev is a two-time Stanley Cup champion, winning with the Blues in 2019 and the Golden Knights in 2023. Barbashev played for HC MVD in the Russian Junior Hockey League (MHL) during the 2011–12 season. In 38 games with the club he recorded 8 goals and 10 points. At the conclusion of the season, Barbashev was selected first overall by the Moncton Wildcats in the 2012 Canadian Hockey League Import Draft. Barbashev joined the Wildcats in 2012 where he scored 62 points in his first season, and was named to the QMJHL All-Rookie Team. Eligible for the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, Barbashev was the only "A"-rated prospect on the NHL Central Scouting Bureau's preliminary list of players to watch in the QMJHL. After his selection by the Blues in the second round, Barbashev was later signed to a three-year entry-level contract with the club on 21 July 2014. Barbashev made his professional debut in the 2015–16 season with the Blues' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Chicago Wolves. He recorded 28 points in 65 games. Barbashev made his NHL debut on 25 January 2017 against the Minnesota Wild. At the time he was second on the Wolves in scoring with 37 points in 44 games. His first goal came against Andrew Hammond of the Ottawa Senators on 7 February. Barbashev finished the season playing 30 games for the Blues, where he had 12 points, and had 37 points in 46 games for the Wolves. Barbashev's first full season with the Blues came in 2018–19, where he recorded 26 points in 80 games. He and the Blues won the Stanley Cup, defeating the Boston Bruins in seven games. In 25 postseason games, he scored six points. On 1 September 2019, the Blues re-signed Barbashev to a two-year, $2.95 million contract extension. The 2022–23 season proved difficult for the Blues, who dropped out of contention for the postseason by the midpoint. Barbashev likewise did not match his record totals from the prior year, but posted 10 goals and 29 points in 59 games. With his contract set to expire, he was considered an in-demand player at the trade deadline. On February 26, 2023, he was traded to the Vegas Golden Knights in exchange for prospect Zach Dean. Barbashev proved an immediate success on arriving in Vegas, with 6 goals and 10 assists in 23 regular season games. By the beginning of the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs, he was playing on the team's top line alongside Jonathan Marchessault and Jack Eichel. He had 7 goals and 11 assists in Vegas' deep run to the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals, where they defeated the Florida Panthers to take the championship, the team's first and Barbashev's second. Following their victory, there was some question as to whether Vegas would be able to retain Barbashev, given its constraints under the salary cap. On June 28, 2023, Barbashev signed a five-year, $25 million extension with the Golden Knights. The team had earlier that day traded veteran forward Reilly Smith in order to create the necessary room for Barbashev's contract. Competing internationally with the Russian national junior team, Barbashev won gold at the 2012 World U-17 Hockey Challenge, played at the 2012 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, placed fourth at the 2013 IIHF World U18 Championships, and won bronze at the 2014 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. At the 2014 World Juniors, he was the youngest player on the Russian team, and had one goal and one assist. Barbashev began skating at age three. Barbashev's older brother Sergei plays for Admiral Vladivostok of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Barbashev and his wife married in July 2014. He also has a younger brother, Max, who played in the Dynamo Moscow youth system, and is currently playing with the Moncton Wildcats.
