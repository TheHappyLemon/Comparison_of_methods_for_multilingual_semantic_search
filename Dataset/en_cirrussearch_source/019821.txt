It was probably the site of a fortress, which protected a trade route from Moravia to Bohemia. After the settlement was founded, the fortress became a manor house. After Konice changed hands several times, it became a property of the Lords of Švábenice, who held it from 1434 to 1655. After several property disputes, it was bought by the Hradisko Monastery in 1699. The monastery was abolished in 1784 and its propertives were managed by the state. Konice was bought by the entrepreneur Karel Příza in 1825. He reconstructed the local castle and moved there in 1830. His family owned the estate until 1945. In 1970, Konice obtained the status of a town. The largest employer is the textile company Moděva Konice. It was founded in 1931 and resides in Konice since 1949. Konice lies on the Prostějov–Dzbel railway line of local importance. The most important monument is the Konice Castle. This Baroque castle replaced the old fortress in 1705. The parish Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary was first indirectly mentioned in 1371. It was and rebuilt into its current form in 1699–1709. It houses a unique wooden pulpit.
