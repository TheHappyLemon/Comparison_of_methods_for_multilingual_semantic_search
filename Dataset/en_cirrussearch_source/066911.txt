48°00′15″N 91°38′26″E﻿ / ﻿48.00417°N 91.64056°E﻿ / 48.00417; 91.64056 Khovd (Mongolian: Ховд, romanized: Hovd, pronounced [ˈχɔw̜t]), formerly known as Kobdo or Khobdo, is the capital of the Khovd Province of Mongolia. It is the administrative seat of the Jargalant sum. Khovd is situated at the foot of the Altay Mountains, and is bisected by the Buyant River. The Khar-Us Lake is located approximately 25 km (15.5 mi) east of Khovd and is the site of a Strictly Protected Area (Mongolian Government designation), called the Mankhan Nature Preserve.[citation needed] In 1992, as the result of the Mongolian government passing a series of administrative and land reforms, Khovd was integrated as part of the Jargalant sum created in the area. The total city area is 80 km2 (30.8 mi2.) According to the Köppen climate classification, Khovd has a cold desert climate, marked with long, dry, frigid winters and short warm summers. Precipitation is minimal and very heavily concentrated in summer. The city was established by Galdan Boshogtu Khan of Dzungaria in the 17th century on the bank of the river Khovd in what is now Erdenebüren sum. Horticulture was developed around city Khovd using the land cultivating experience from Taranchi and Central Asian captives. The city was 'moved' by the Qing administration after destruction of the Dzungar Khanate after 1757 on to the bank of the river Buyant. On 7 August 1912, the Mongol troops under leadership of Manlai Baatur Damdinsuren, Khatanbaatar Magsarjav and Ja Lama Dambiijantsan captured the city of Khovd, destroyed all the Manchu-Chinese garrisons and abolished the governance of the Qing-appointed amban. The city had a population of 26,023 in 2000 (2000 census), 30,479 in 2003 (est.) and 28,601 in 2007. The 2010 population was recorded at 29,046. In 2005, Jargalant sum (the centre of Khovd Aimag) had 32,351 inhabitants (6,675 households), belonging to more than ten ethnic groups and nationalities such as Uuld, Khalkh, Zakhchin, Torguud, Uriankhai, Myangad, Dörbet, Bayads, Kazak, Chantuu and Üzemchin.
