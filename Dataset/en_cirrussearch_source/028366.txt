Yamal-101 (Russian: Ямал-101) was an intended geostationary communications satellite that was lost after launch. It was built by RSC Energia and operated by Gazprom Space Systems. It was, along with Yamal-102 the first communications satellite of the Yamal programme and the first iteration of the USP Bus. It was a 1,360 kg (3,000 lb) satellite with 2200 watts of power (1300 watts available for the payload) on an unpressurized bus. It had eight SPT-70 electric thrusters by OKB Fakel for station keeping. Its payload was 12 C-band equivalent transponders supplied by Space Systems/Loral. It was launched successfully with Yamal-102, on 6 September 1999 at 16:36:00 UTC from Baikonur Site 81/23 by a Proton-K / Blok DM-2M directly to geostationary orbit. Due to a failure in the electrical system at solar panel deployment it was lost right after launch. After Yamal-101 failed, Gazprom Space Systems registered Yamal-102 as Yamal-101. This caused significant confusion, but the records are clear that the satellite that failed was the original Yamal-101. Insurance paid US$50 million for the failure.
