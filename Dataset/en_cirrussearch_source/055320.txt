Bolshoy Begichev (Russian: Большой Бегичев, lit. 'Big Begichev') is an island in the Laptev Sea, in the Sakha Republic, Russia. The area of the island is 1,764 square kilometres (681 sq mi). Bolshoy Begichev is located within the Khatanga Gulf (Russian: Хатангский залив), splitting the gulf into two straits. Only 8.5 kilometres (5.3 mi) west of Bolshoy Begichev lies the much smaller island known as Maliy Begichev Island. Its size is only 15 square kilometres (5.8 sq mi). The border between administrative divisions of the Russian Federation runs between the two Begichev islands, so that while Maliy Begichev is in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Bolshoy Begichev is in the Sakha republic. Both Bolshoy Begichev and Maliy Begichev are named after Russian polar explorer Nikifor Begichev. North of Bolshoy Begichev lies small Preobrazheniya Island. This elongated granitic island was useful as a landmark for ships plying the Northern Sea Route in the past. A NAVTEX Coast Station used to be situated on the island at 74°32′N 112°02′E﻿ / ﻿74.533°N 112.033°E﻿ / 74.533; 112.033. However, according to the NAVTEX list as of July 2010[update] the station was no longer listed. There are muskoxen on the island. William Barr, The First Soviet Convoy to the Mouth of the Lena.
