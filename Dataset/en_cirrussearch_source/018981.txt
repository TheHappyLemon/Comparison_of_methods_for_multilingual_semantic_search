The 1975 Ice Hockey World Championships were the 42nd Ice Hockey World Championships and the 53rd European Championships of ice hockey. The tournament took place in West Germany from 3 to 19 April and the games were played in Munich and Düsseldorf. Six teams took part in the main tournament, each playing each other twice. The Soviet Union won all of their games, and became World Champions for the 14th time, and won their 17th European title. This year did not offer much in the way of drama, with the expected order of finish happening again, and the host not even playing in the top level tournament. This helped to change the player eligibility rules and change the format. Finland narrowly missed a medal again, finishing fourth for the sixth straight year.
