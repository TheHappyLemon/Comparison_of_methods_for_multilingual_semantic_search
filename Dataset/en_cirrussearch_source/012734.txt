Craiova (/krəˈjoʊvə/, also US: /kraɪˈoʊvə, krɑːˈjɔːvɑː, krɑːˈjoʊvɑː/, Romanian: [kraˈjova] ), is the largest city in southwestern Romania and capital of Dolj County, situated near the east bank of the river Jiu in central Oltenia. It is a longstanding political center, and is located at approximately equal distances from the Southern Carpathians (north) and the River Danube (south). Craiova is the chief commercial city west of Bucharest and the most important city of Oltenia. The city prospered as a regional trading centre despite an earthquake in 1790, a plague in 1795, and a Turkish assault in 1802 during which it was burned. Eight villages are administered by the city: Făcăi, Mofleni, Popoveni, Șimnicu de Jos, Cernele, Cernelele de Sus, Izvoru Rece, and Rovine. The last four were a separate commune called Cernele until 1996, when they were merged into the city. There are two possible etymologies for Craiova: Old Slavonic kral ("king"), which has been borrowed in Romania as crai and Slavonic krajina ("border" or "edge"). Since no source prior to 1475 mentions the city, it is impossible to tell which of the two words is the real etymology. The name is probably of Serbian origin, due to historical autochthonous minorities in the area. In Hungarian, the town is either referred to as Királyi, a remnant of the city's Hungarian rule during the Árpád dynasty, or as Krajova. The German name of the city is Krajowa.

Its ancient bans, the highest ranking boyars of the Wallachian state, were initially those of the Craiovești family. The bans had the right of minting coins stamped with their own effigies – the origin of the Romanian word ban as used for coins. The economic power of the Craiovești family at the end of the 16th century was about 100 villages (182 financial goods). This power gave them a statute of political autonomy so big, that the hospodars ruling at that time were not able to keep in power without an alliance with this powerful dynasty. From the Craiovești family there were chosen a lot of hospodars to rule the country: Neagoe Basarab, Radu de la Afumați, Radu Șerban (1602–1611), Matei Basarab, Constantin Șerban, Șerban Cantacuzino, Constantin Brâncoveanu. In 1395 Craiova was probably the scene of a victory won by the Wallachian Prince Mircea I of Wallachia over Bayezid I, Sultan of the Ottomans (see Battle of Rovine).[citation needed] Frequently referred to as "a city" after the first half of the 16th century, the Craiova area was always regarded as an important economic region of Wallachia and Romania at large. During the 1718–1739 Habsburg occupation of Oltenia (see Banat of Craiova), Craiova's status declined due to economic pressures and increased centralism, partly leading to an increase in hajduk actions, in parallel with protests of Craiovan boyars. In 1761, under Prince Constantine Mavrocordatos, the bans relocated to Bucharest, leaving behind kaymakams to represent them in Craiova. Under Prince Emanuel Giani Ruset, Wallachia's seat was moved to Craiova (1770–1771), viewed as a place of refuge during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774. A large part of the city was burned down by the rebel pasha Osman Pazvantoğlu in 1800. During the Wallachian uprising of 1821, inhabitants of the present-day Dolj County joined Tudor Vladimirescu's Pandurs in great numbers, contributing to the expedition on Bucharest. During the first two decades of the 19th century, Craiova witnessed economic prosperity, centered on handicraft trades and public services. During Imperial Russian occupation and the early stages of Organic Statute rules (1828–1834), the city increased its economic output; in 1832 there were 595 shops, 197 of which were made barracks and 398 were houses built of brick. At the time, Craiova exported wheat, furs, leather, live animals and other products into the Austrian and Ottoman Empires. Costache Romanescu, a citizen of Craiova, was among the leaders of the Provisional Government during the 1848 Wallachian revolution. Wallachia's last two rulers, Gheorghe Bibescu and Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei, came from an important boyar family residing in Craiova – the Bibescu family. Around 1860, there were 4,633 buildings in Craiova, which were 3,220 houses, 26 churches, 11 schools and 60 factories and workshops. In all, the city also housed about 90 industrial establishments, of which 12 were mills, 3 breweries, 2 gas and oil factories, 4 tanning yards and 2 printing presses; 57% of the total number of craftsmen of Dolj County lived in Craiova (1,088 craftsmen, 687 journeymen and 485 apprentices). The period following the Independence War was a time of economic and cultural progress. As a result, at the end of the 19th century, the city of Craiova, with its 40,000 inhabitants, had developed small factories (producing chemicals, farming utilities, and construction materials) and textile factories. On October 26, 1896, the Craiova power station entered service (with AEG equipment working at 310 CP, supplying 365 streetlights on 39 streets, forming a 30 km-long network); Craiova was the first city in the country to be supplied with electric power by internal combustion engines. In 1900, Craiova had 43.1% of the industrial units of Oltenia; these numbered 924 industrial companies (including 20 large industrial establishments, employing 1,078 workers). The number of large industrial establishments rose to 40 by 1925. Banking also developed at the beginning of the 20th century (when 6 banks and 2 bureaux de change were already operating). In the interwar period, Craiova, as the centre of an agricultural region, experienced little further industrialization; the number of industrial workers remained comparatively small. In 1939, Craiova had 7 industrial units with over 100 workers: the clothing industry companies Oltenia and Scrisul Românesc were well-known all over the country and abroad. The Treaty of Craiova was signed here on 7 September 1940; under its terms, Romania ceded to Bulgaria the territory of Southern Dobruja, which Romania had gained after the 1913 Second Balkan War. In the early 1960s, under the Communist regime, the city became a centre for the automotive and engine building industries, as well as for aerospace manufacturing, chemical industry, food industry, construction, electrical engineering, mining and the electrical power industry. The construction of housing estates also begins at this time, with Brazda lui Novac being one of the first in 1967–1968, followed by Siloz-Valea Roșie in the same years. Later on in the 1980s the Craiovița Nouă, Rovine, 1 Mai, Sărari and Lăpuș-Argeș housing estates are built. After the 1989 Revolution brought the re-establishment of a free market and decentralisation in overall management, several industries became subject to privatisation, while the market opened itself to private initiatives. Industry, although affected by economic changes, remains an important branch, representing circa 70% of Craiova's output. Under the Köppen climate classification, Craiova has a humid continental climate (Dfa), bordering on a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa). This results in a combination of occasional cold winters, but too mild of a climate to contain permanent snow cover, along with long and hot summers. Annually, Craiova experiences 64 days with fog, more frequently in winter than other seasons. The city also experiences 34 days per year with thunder, and 1 day with hail. Snowfall and Dew Point are for 1961-1990 period As of 2021[update], 234,140 inhabitants live within the city limits, a decrease from the figure recorded in 2011, making it the 7th most populous city in Romania. Ethnic composition (2011): Romanians: 241,176 (89.5%) Roma: 5,291 (2.0%) Other: 808 (0.3%) Data unavailable: 22,231 (8.2%) Ethnic composition (2021): Romanians: 190,634 (81.4%) Roma: 2,639 (1.1%) Other: 922 (0.4%) Data unavailable: 39,945 (17%) In the first two decades of the 19th century, Craiova was characterized by economic growth and the increased presence of trade, commerce, and public services. Similarly to other large urban areas, Craiova became a commercial, administrative and cultural centre. During the Tsarist take-over (1828–1834), Craiova experienced significant economic growth. In 1832, there were 595 shops, of which "187 [were] of wood and 398 of stone wall". The city was the commercial centre of Oltenia. It exported cereal, skins, wax, animals, tallow and services to Austria and Turkey. As a consequence of the permanent high demand for exports, Craiova was the site of the first Romanian society for shares in cereal shipping on the Danube to Brăila, established in 1846. Around 1860 in Craiova there were 4633 buildings, of which 3220 were houses, 26 churches, 11 schools, and 60 factories or workshops. There were also approximately 90 establishments with an industrial character, of which 12 were wind mills, 3 beer factories, 2 gas and oil factories, 4 tanneries, and 2 were printing houses. Statistics show that Craiova was home to 57.7% of the total number of craftsmen in Dolj County (1088 craftsmen, 687 journeymen and 485 apprentices). Towards the end of the 19th century, the city of Craiova had small factories and workshops with chemical products, agricultural machines, graphic design, tanneries, textiles, construction materials, among others. On 26 October 1896, Craiova's power plant (using AEG equpiment) began operations, supplying 365 lamps on 39 streets in a 30 km (18.64 mi) network. Craiova was the first city in the country powered by electricity based on internal combustion engines. In 1900, Craiova held 43.1% of the industrial units in Oltenia, having 924 industrial firms (of which 20 establishments belonged to heavy industry, using 1078 workers). In 1925, the number of heavy industry establishments had increased to 49, and in 1930 the number of workers was 5530. The banking industry was also present; at the beginning of the 20th century, there were 6 banks and 2 bureaux de change. In the inter-war period, the city, situated in an eminently agricultural area, was considered to be industrialising too slowly in comparison with other urban areas of Romania. In 1939, there were only 7 industrial units with over 100 workers in Craiova: the "Oltenia" clothing factory, the "Scrisul Românesc" ("The Romanian Writing") publishing house, the "Concordia" macaroni factory, the "Barbu Druga" bread and macaroni factory, the "Semănătoarea" factory and the "Traiul" bread factory. The only branch of industry at the same level of development as other centers of the country was graphic art. The two printing houses "Ramuri" and "Scrisul Românesc" were well-known all over Romania and abroad. Starting in the 1960s the city became a powerful industrial center; it developed industry in machinery, tools, aircraft, chemicals, food, light industry, construction materials, electronics, extraction, and energy. The Romanian Revolution of 1989 led to important changes in the economy, with the introduction of a free market and decentralization of the management of all national economic sectors. In industry, an overall drop in production capacity was noted, caused by an inability to anticipate the impact of change and the economic shocks that followed the change of system. Nevertheless, industry continues to represent the largest sector of the city's economy (70%). During the post-Revolution period, telecommunication services, banking and insurance, management consulting (CDIMM, Romanian-American Center) began expanding. The number of joint ventures and the value of invested capital at county level have increased to large numbers — Dolj County being the first in respect to these aspects.[citation needed] Of the city's working population (about 110,000 persons), 38% are employed in industry, 15% in trade and repair services, 10% in transport and storage, 8% in education, 5.7% in the medical field.[citation needed] The Craiova Municipal Council, chosen at the 2020 local election, is made up of 27 councillors, with the following party composition: The Craiova Group, inspired by the Visegrád Group, was founded on 24 April 2015 in Craiova by Romania, Bulgaria and Serbia. Greece later joined to the organization in 2017.

Romanescu, the mayor of Craiova at that time, the park was designed by French architect Émile Rendont. Plans for the park were awarded the gold medal at the 1900 World Fair; work began in 1901 and was completed in 1903. Botanical Garden – The garden was laid out by the botanist Alexandru Buia and was opened in 1952. Jiu Meadow The first school in Craiova was founded in 1759 by Constantin Obedeanu.

The buses connected the Craiova railway station with the Nicolae Romanescu Park. The tram was first introduced in 1987, on an 18.4 km (11.43 mi) double-track line, as a result of the state's intention of keeping energy consumption low. The public transport in Craiova today consists of 3 tram lines and 17 bus lines. It is operated by the RAT Craiova [ro], a corporation run by City Hall. There are 190 buses and 35 trams serving the city today. Craiova is also a major railway centre and is connected to all other major Romanian cities, as well as local destinations, through the national Căile Ferate Române network. There are daily trains with service from Craiova to: Bucharest (3 hours), Brașov (6 – 8 hours - via connecting service), Cluj-Napoca (8 – 10 hours - connecting service), Sibiu (4 – 7 hours), Sighișoara (8 – 11 hours - connecting service), Timișoara ( 5 hours)[citation needed] The city is served by Craiova Airport, which has recently been modernised.
