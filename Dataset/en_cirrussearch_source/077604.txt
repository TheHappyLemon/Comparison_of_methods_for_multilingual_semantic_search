Diocese of Leal or Bishopric of Estonia was the name of the main Latin diocese in Estonia during the early Catholic missionary phase. It was established in 1211, with episcopal see in Leal (today Lihula). The two known bishops were Fulco , Theoderich and Hermann of Dorpat who was bishop from 1222-1224. It was suppressed in 1235, to establish on its territory the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dorpat (Tartu), which was itself suppressed in 1558, without succession. GigaCatholic v t e v t e
