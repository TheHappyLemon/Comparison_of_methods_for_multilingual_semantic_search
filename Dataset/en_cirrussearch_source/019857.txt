Hanušovice (German: Hannsdorf) is a town in Šumperk District in the Olomouc Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 3,000 inhabitants. The Holba brewery is located in the town. Villages of Hynčice nad Moravou, Potůčník, Vysoké Žibřidovice and Žleb are administrative parts of Hanušovice. The name of Hanušovice is derived from its original name Hanns Dorf / Hanušova ves, which is equivalent to "John's village". Hanušovice is located about 12 km (7 mi) north of Šumperk and 58 km (36 mi) northwest of Olomouc. It lies in the Hanušovice Highlands. A small part of the municipal territory in the north extends into the Králický Sněžník mountains and includes the highest point of Hanušovice, a contour line at 990 m (3,250 ft) above sea level. The town is situated in a narrow valley at the confluence of the rivers Morava and Branná. The first written mention of Hanušovice is from 1325. The village was burned down during the Bohemian–Hungarian War (1468–1478) and renewed a hundred years later. In the 16th century, the hamlet of Holba was founded. Hanušovice was originally an agricultural village, but became industrialised in 1852 after the cotton mill was established. In 1923, Hanušovice and Holba were merged. The municipality became a town in 1975. Hanušovice was originally ethnically a German village. During the World War II, the Gross Rosen concentration camp was located nearby, and Polish Jewish women had to work in factories. The English prisoners of war also worked there. After the war, the whole German population was expelled and Hanušovice was resettled by Czechs. Hanušovice is known for the Holba brewery, founded in 1874. Hanušovice is a railway junction. It lies on two railway lines: Šumperk–Hanušovice–Jeseník and Zábřeh–Hanušovice–Jeseník.
