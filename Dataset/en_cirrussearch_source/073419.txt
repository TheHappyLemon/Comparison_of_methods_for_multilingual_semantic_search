Amanita citrina (synonym Amanita mappa), commonly known as the false death cap or citron amanita, is a basidiomycotic mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. It grows in silicate soil in the summer and autumn months. It bears a pale yellow or sometimes white cap, with white stem, ring and volva. It is an inedible mushroom due to its toxicity, but is more pertinently often confused for the lethal death cap. This mushroom has a fleshy pale yellow, or sometimes white, cap from 4–10 centimetres (1+1⁄2–4 inches) across, covered in irregular patches. The gills and flesh are white. There is a large volva at the base of the 6–8 cm (2+1⁄2–3 in) tall stem, which has a clear ring. The mushroom has a smell of rapeseed or potato. It is often confused with the related Amanita phalloides, the death cap, hence the common name. The false death cap is found in deciduous and coniferous woodlands in autumn in Europe. It is also found in North American oak and pine forests. This mushroom contains the alpha-amanitin toxin,[citation needed] but possibly in small enough amounts that would not cause adverse effects unless ingested at high quantity.[citation needed] It also contains the toxin bufotenin. Although it is considered inedible, the biggest danger with this species is its marked similarity to the death cap.
