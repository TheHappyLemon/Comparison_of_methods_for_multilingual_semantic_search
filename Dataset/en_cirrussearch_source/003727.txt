He called up from Pittsburgh's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre Penguins, in December 2005, where he earned the nickname "Killer" after jumping to Sidney Crosby's defence in a game against the Ottawa Senators.[citation needed] The Penguins decided against re-signing him following the 2005–06 season and he signed with Luleå HF of the Swedish Elitserien.[citation needed] On May 24, 2007, it became official that Surový had signed a deal with Linköpings HC, also of the Elitserien.[citation needed] On July 9, 2007, Surový signed with the Phoenix Coyotes. However, his contract with Phoenix was cancelled and he returned to Linköpings HC on September 26, 2007.[citation needed] In October 2009, Sureý signed a one-year contract with Skellefteå AIK of the Elitserien. After scoring 23 points in 48 games in the 2009–10 season, in July 2010, he moved to Latvia to join Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) club Dinamo Riga.[citation needed] On June 7, 2013, Surový joined his fourth successive KHL club after signing a one-year contract with Dinamo Minsk.
