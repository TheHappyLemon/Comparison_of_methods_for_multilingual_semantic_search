Charly Mottet (born 16 December 1962 in Valence, Drôme) is a French former professional cyclist (1983 to 1994). He was one of the best French road cyclists of his era. His daughter, Eva Mottet, was also a road racing cyclist. She competed as a junior at the 2012 UCI Road World Championships, where she heavily crashed in the women's junior road race. Charly Mottet was an UCI-official at the race. Eva would never fully recover. She died young in April 2020, aged 25. Mottet won a total of 67 races, including the Tour de Romandie in 1990, and rode eight times in the Tour de France. His best results in the Tour de France were 4th-place finishes in 1987 and 1991. He won three stages, one in 1990 (Stage 15 : Millau – Revel) and two in 1991 (Stage 11 : Quimper – Saint-Herblain and Stage 12 : Pau – Jaca). He also finished 2nd in the 1990 Giro d'Italia. During his professional cycling career, Mottet had a reputation within the peloton as being a totally clean rider who never used performance-enhancing drugs. He is former FICP World No. 1 (in May and August 1989). After retiring from racing, Mottet became involved in race organising, working on the Critérium du Dauphiné (where he was assistant director) for 14 years, before being appointed sports manager of the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec and Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal in 2010.
