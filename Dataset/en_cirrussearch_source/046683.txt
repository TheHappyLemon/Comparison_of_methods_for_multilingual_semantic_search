D'Angelo Russell (born February 23, 1996), nicknamed "DLo", is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected as a McDonald's All-American in 2014 and played college basketball for the Ohio State Buckeyes. He was selected second overall in the 2015 NBA draft by the Lakers. Playing point guard, Russell was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team with the Lakers in 2016. He was traded to the Brooklyn Nets in 2017, and received his first All-Star selection in 2019. In the 2019 off-season, he joined the Golden State Warriors via a sign-and-trade deal, and was then traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves at the 2020 trade deadline. Three years later, he was traded back to the Lakers at the 2023 trade deadline. Russell attended Central High School in Louisville, Kentucky as a freshman in 2010–11, before transferring to Montverde Academy in Montverde, Florida for his sophomore season. In 2014, he helped Montverde win back-to-back High School National Tournament championships playing alongside Ben Simmons. He later played in the McDonald's All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic. Russell committed to Ohio State on June 7, 2013, choosing the Buckeyes over Louisville, Michigan State and North Carolina. Russell was rated by Rivals.com as a five-star recruit. Russell played one season of college basketball for the Ohio State Buckeyes. On January 9, 2015, he recorded a career-high 14 rebounds in a win over Maryland, later scoring a career-high 33 points in a win over Northwestern on January 21. On February 8, in a 79–60 win over Rutgers, Russell recorded a triple-double with 23 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. This was the first triple-double recorded by an Ohio State freshman. During the NCAA Tournament, Russell scored 28 points in a 75–72 overtime win over VCU. However, the Buckeyes' season ended the following round with a 73–58 loss to Arizona. Russell earned the Jerry West Award and he was named a consensus first-team All-American, as well as first-team All-Big Ten and Big Ten Freshman of the Year. In 35 games for Ohio State in 2014–15, Russell averaged 19.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.6 steals in 33.9 minutes per game. On April 22, 2015, Russell declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final three years of college eligibility. He was touted by many scouts and reporters to be one of the top prospects in the 2015 draft. On June 25, 2015, Russell was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers with the second overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft. In his debut for the Lakers in their season opener on October 28, 2015, Russell recorded four points, three rebounds and two assists in just under 26 minutes in a 112–111 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

On March 1, he set career highs with 39 points and eight three-pointers in a 107–101 win over the Brooklyn Nets. His 39 points were the most by any rookie in 2015–16 and the most by a Lakers rookie in a regular season game since Elgin Baylor had 55 in March 1959. His eight three-pointers broke Nick Van Exel's previous rookie Laker record of six in a single game.

In a 2019 interview on ESPN's First Take, then Lakers director of basketball operations Magic Johnson admitted that Russell's Snapchat incident with Nick Young, in which Russell secretly recorded Young admitting that he had cheated on then-fiancée Iggy Azalea, played a role in his decision to trade Russell.

On March 23, he recorded his first career triple-double with 18 points, 13 assists, and 11 rebounds in a 116–112 loss to the Raptors.

Russell is close friends with Karl-Anthony Towns and fulfilled their dreams of playing together in the NBA. He debuted for Minnesota four days later, recording 22 points and five assists in a 137–126 loss to the Toronto Raptors. On February 23, he sat out the first game of a back-to-back against the Denver Nuggets to rest his sore knee. Since the game was nationally televised on NBA TV, the visiting Timberwolves were deemed to have violated the NBA's policy against resting healthy players and fined $25,000, becoming the first team to be fined since the policy was instituted in 2017. On February 24, 2022, Russell led the Timberwolves to a 119–114 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies by scoring a season-high 37 points, along with 9 assists.
