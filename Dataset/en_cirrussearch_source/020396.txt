Carl Filip Anton Forsberg (pronounced [Ààf«êÀêl…™p Ààf…îÃÇ ÇÀêb√¶rj]; born 13 August 1994) is a Swedish professional ice hockey player for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL). Forsberg was selected by the Washington Capitals in the first round, 11th overall, of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. Forsberg had standout performances at both the 2011 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament in B≈ôeclav, Czech Republic, and the World U18 Championships Tournament in Brno, Czech Republic, where he was a member of the silver-medal winning Sweden teams. At the World Juniors in Brno, he was also named Best Forward of the tournament. In the final rankings of NHL Central Scouting, Forsberg was the highest-rated European-based forward available in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected 11th overall in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft by the Washington Capitals. On 13 July 2012, while attending his first Capitals development camp, he signed a three-year, entry-level contract. Forsberg was returned to his former club, Leksands IF, on loan for the duration of the 2012‚Äì13 season. He again improved upon his season totals for the third consecutive year to finish with 33 points in 38 games to help Leksand gain promotion to return to the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) for the following season. On 3 April 2013, while playing in Allsv, Forsberg was traded to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Martin Erat and Michael Latta. When his Swedish season completed, Forsberg joined the Predators in Tennessee for the remainder of the lockout-shortened 2012‚Äì13 season. After participating in one practice with the team, Forsberg made his NHL debut on 14 April 2013 against the Detroit Red Wings. He recorded two shots on goal and finished with a minus 2 rating through 18:37 minutes of ice time. Upon making his debut at 18 years, 244 days, Forsberg became the third-youngest player in franchise history to suit up for the Predators. He recorded his first career NHL point with a secondary assist on David Legwand's 200th career NHL goal on 24 April against the Calgary Flames. Forsberg scored his first NHL goal on 8 October 2013 against Niklas B√§ckstr√∂m of the Minnesota Wild. He finished the 2013‚Äì14 season with five points (one goal and four assists) in 13 games played with the Predators, in addition to 34 points (15 goals and 19 assists) in 47 games with the Predators' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. On 22 January 2015, Forsberg was named to the 2015 NHL All-Star Game in Columbus, replacing the Pittsburgh Penguins' Evgeni Malkin, who pulled out of the game due to injury. In the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, Forsberg became the youngest Nashville Predator to score a playoff goal in franchise history[citation needed] and also recorded the first playoff hat-trick in franchise history in the first round against the Chicago Blackhawks. Forsberg was voted to the playoff NHL All-Rookie Team for the 2014‚Äì15 season. During the 2015‚Äì16 season, Forsberg continued to surpass franchise milestones, recording two natural hat-tricks in a four-day span, the shortest time period between natural hat tricks since 1987‚Äì88. He also became the youngest Predator to record a regular season hat-trick. Forsberg became the first player in Predators history to record multiple hat-tricks in a single season. He also led the team in scoring for the second consecutive year and set a new career high (64) in points and goals, with 33. His 33 goals tied the Predators' franchise record. In March 2016, Forsberg was named to Sweden's 2016 World Cup of Hockey roster. On 27 June 2016, Forsberg agreed to a six-year, $36 million contract to keep him in Nashville through to the 2021‚Äì22 season. In late February 2017, Forsberg scored back-to-back hat-tricks against the Calgary Flames and the Colorado Avalanche, making him the first player in Predators history and the first NHL player in over seven years to accomplish the feat. Prior to the 2017‚Äì18 season, Forsberg was named an alternate captain alongside Mattias Ekholm and Ryan Johansen. On 30 December 2017, the Predators placed Forsberg on injured reserve with an undisclosed injury. With this, Forsberg's streak of 325 consecutive games (regular season and playoffs) played came to an end. During the 2019‚Äì20 season, on January 14, 2020, Forsberg successfully scored a "Michigan goal", being only the second player in NHL history to do so, at the time, only behind Andrei Svechnikov of the Carolina Hurricanes. In the 2021‚Äì22 season, Forsberg enjoyed a resurgent year offensively, alongside Matt Duchene and Ryan Johansen. On March 19, 2022, Forsberg surpassed David Legwand as the leading goal scorer in Predators history, scoring his 211th goal in a 6-3 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs. He finished the regular season setting career highs with 42 goals and 42 assists for 84 points in just 69 games. As a pending free agent for the first-time in his career, Forsberg opted to remain with the Predators after signing an eight-year, $68 million contract extension to stay until the 2029‚Äì30 season on 9 July 2022. Forsberg was born to Carina Dahlberg and Patrik Forsberg. At birth, he was named Carl Filip Anton Forsberg, although he is referred to by his second name, "Filip". He has a younger brother, Fredrik Forsberg, who plays hockey in the HV71 organization. The brothers are of no relation to Hockey Hall of Famer Peter Forsberg or Ottawa Senators goaltender Anton Forsberg. Filip Forsberg married American country singer Erin Alvey on July 23, 2022. He is a supporter of Liverpool FC. Forsberg, along with professional basketball players Alex, Thanasis, Kostas, and Giannis Antetokounmpo, were announced as joining the Nashville SC ownership group in the MLS. In 2017, Forsberg became part owner of a five-year-old female Italian race horse named Trilly of Nando with fellow Swedish hockey player Jacob de la Rose of the Montreal Canadiens.
