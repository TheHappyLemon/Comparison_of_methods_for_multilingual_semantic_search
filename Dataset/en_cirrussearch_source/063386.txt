Two Canadians participated, although not as a national team (These were not introduced until later Olympics). Canada's Olympians were George Orton and Ronald J. MacDonald. Orton was the first Canadian to win a medal, finishing first in the 2500-metre steeplechase. He later finished third in the 400-metre hurdles and fifth in the 4000-metre steeplechase. Orton, who was at school at the University of Pennsylvania, had accompanied a United States delegation to the games. The following competitors won multiple medals at the 1900 Olympic Games.
