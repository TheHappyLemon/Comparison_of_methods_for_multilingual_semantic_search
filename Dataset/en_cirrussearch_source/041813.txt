Her brother followed her and also became an international biathlon competitor. Iryna debuted internationally at the 2009 World Junior Championships, placing fourth individually. In 2011 she was included in the senior national team. 1 medal (1 gold) 0 medals *During Olympic seasons competitions are only held for those events not included in the Olympic program. **The single mixed relay was added as an event in 2019.
