Mount Irving is a mountain rising to ca. 1,950 metres (6,398 ft) that is the dominant elevation on Clarence Island, in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. (Some older sources used to give the elevation as 2,300 metres (7,546 ft).) The rounded, heavily glaciated mountain is situated in Urda Ridge occupying the southern part of the island. A prominent feature, the mountain doubtless was known to sealers in the area in the 1820s. It was named by United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) for Rear Admiral Sir Edmund George Irving, Royal Navy, Hydrographer of the Navy, 1960–66.
