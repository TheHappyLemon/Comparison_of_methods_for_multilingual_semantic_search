13 Voices is the sixth studio album by Canadian rock band Sum 41, released on October 7, 2016. It is the first of two albums by the band to be released through independent label Hopeless Records. It is also Sum 41's first album to feature drummer Frank Zummo, who replaced original drummer Steve Jocz, and their first album to feature guitarist Tom Thacker. The album also features the return of longtime lead guitarist Dave Baksh (who left in 2006 and returned in 2015). The album is also their first as a five-piece band, as it features both Baksh and Thacker on lead guitar. On May 11, 2016, the band announced that they had signed to Hopeless Records to release the crowd-funded project. On July 9, 2015, the band launched a PledgeMusic campaign for its comeback album. On July 23, 2015, the band played its comeback show at the Alternative Press Music Awards, which featured former lead guitarist Dave Baksh, joining the group on stage nine years after officially leaving the band. Sum 41 announced Baksh's official return on August 14, 2015, and also announced that he will join the band in the studio. On December 26, 2015, Sum 41 teased two new songs on its Instagram account. On January 1, 2016, Deryck Whibley revealed that the album was nearing completion via the band's social media. The band performed on the 2016 Warped Tour. On April 19, 2016, Whibley published that Sum 41 was finishing the album. On May 11, 2016, Sum 41 announced its signing to Hopeless Records. The release's final song "Twisted by Design" replaces "With Me" (from 2007's Underclass Hero) as the band's longest song to date, with a running time of 5 minutes and 28 seconds. On November 26, 2012, the band members revealed that they were taking a break from touring in 2013 to begin work on a new record. On April 18, 2013, drummer Jocz announced he would be leaving the band via his official Facebook page, leaving Whibley as the sole founding member of the band. In an interview on February 7, 2014, Deryck revealed that the band has possibly found a new drummer and would be premiering new music "soon". The expected sixth album would have been the band's first with Whibley and McCaslin as the only two remaining members from the group's "classic line-up", until Baksh's return in 2015, which also marks his first album with Sum 41 since 2004's Chuck. The album is the band's first to feature drummer Frank Zummo, as well as their first album as a five-piece. On May 16, 2014, Deryck Whibley posted on an entry on his personal website, explaining that he had a liver and kidney failure due to extensive drinking. He has explained that he has been in treatment in the hospital for a month, and now upon release, he will be taking care of his health, while continue working on new music. He also stated that he had some ideas for new songs already, and that the band would be soon starting to make a new album. On June 9, 2014, Deryck Whibley has stated on his personal Facebook page that he was working on new Sum 41 music out of his home studio to get ready to record some new music soon. On June 29, 2014, Whibley posted an entry on his website, entitled "getting ready to record drums", with photos of him setting up the drum kit for recording. On June 6, 2016, Sum 41 announced that the group's sixth studio album would be titled 13 Voices and that the album is scheduled for release on October 7, 2016. The cover art and tracklist were also revealed that same day. "Fake My Own Death", the band's first new song in five years, was released on June 28, 2016. The song was released as an instant grat for pre-ordering the album on iTunes. The song was performed on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on October 3, 2016. Deryck stated that the first official single had not yet been picked and the band wanted to put out new music to hold the fans over. The album's first official single "War", was released on August 25, 2016. The album's eighth track, "God Save Us All (Death to Pop)" was released (along with a live music video) on September 29, 2016.
