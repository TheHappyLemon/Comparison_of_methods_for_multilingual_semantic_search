The EuroCup Women (officially FIBA EuroCup Women) is the second-level basketball competition with teams from associate members of FIBA Europe. It succeeds the Ronchetti Cup. Unlike the EuroCup Men, the competition is entirely organized by FIBA Europe, just like EuroLeague Women As for the EuroLeague Women, the EuroCup had a Final Four to appoint the winner from 2003 (year of creation) to 2005. In 2006, this system is abandoned and we go back to the former format of the Ronchetti Cup, that is to say a final in a home and away game.
