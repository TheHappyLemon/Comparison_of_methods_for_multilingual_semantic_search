The Latvia–Russia border is the state border between Republic of Latvia (EU member) and the Russian Federation (CIS member). The length of the border is 214 kilometres (133 mi). Since 2004, it became an eastern part of external border of the European Union, Schengen Area and NATO. The Pskov region and Latvia have had historical ties since the founding of the Pskov Republic in the 13th century. From 1925 to 1945 Abrene County was part of the Republic of Latvia. Following the Soviet occupation, on 16 January 1945 the area was transferred from the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic to Pskov Oblast and renamed Pytalovsky District. After regaining independence in 1991, Latvia initially claimed the previous Latvian territory, on the basis of the 1920 Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty. The delimitation of the border was completed in 1998, but the treaty on the state border was signed and ratified only on 27 March 2007. It recognised the Pytalovsky District as part of Russia. As a result of the 2023 Wagner Group rebellion, Latvia immediately sealed its borders from Russia in response to the mutiny until further notice. According to the 2007 agreement on the Russian-Latvian State Border, the state border between Latvia and Russia starting from the intersection point of the state borders of Latvia, Russia and Belarus, and ends with the joint borders of Latvia, Russia and Estonia. Latvia borders only one oblast of Russia, the Pskov Oblast. Russia borders three Latvian municipalities. The access-restricted Border Security Zone of Russia lies along the border on the Russian side. In order to visit this zone, a permit issued by the local FSB department is required (the only exceptions are international border transit points). Crossing the border is allowed only at border controls. Most people need a visa on one or both sides of the border.
