Serhiy Gonchar (Ukrainian: Сергій Гончар; born 3 July 1970) is a Ukrainian former professional road racing cyclist. He won the World Time Trial Championship in 2000. Due to a temporary spelling error in his passport, he is often incorrectly called Honchar. Gonchar failed a blood health check in the 1999 Tour de Suisse, and was removed from the race. Even though it was only a health check, and not a doping offence, the Tour de France organisation still decided to ban his Vini Caldirola team from the 1999 Tour de France. In the 2006 Tour de France, Gonchar lead the general classification after a time-trial win in stage 7. In time trialing, Gonchar rocks the top of his body to get the most out of a big gear. He beat Landis, Zabriskie, Lang, Rogers, Klöden, Evans and various others in the individual time trials in the 2006 Tour de France. On 11 May 2007, Gonchar was suspended for 30 days by his T-Mobile team, following blood tests taken at Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the Tour de Romandie. On 19 June 2007, the T-Mobile team announced the termination of his contract. When Gonchar was not able to find a new team in 2010, he retired. 1993 1st Overall Okolo Slovenska 1997 1st Chrono des Herbiers 1st Stage 5 (ITT) Tour de Suisse 2nd Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 3rd Grand Prix Eddy Merckx 5th Overall Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 18 (ITT) 9th Gran Premio de Llodio 1998 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Chrono des Herbiers 1st Stage 3b (ITT) Four Days of Dunkirk 3rd Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 7th Overall Ronde van Nederland 1st Stage 3b (ITT) 10th Overall Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 21 (ITT) Held after Stages 3 & 4 1999 1st Overall Ronde van Nederland 1st Stage 3b (ITT) 1st Chrono des Herbiers 1st Grand Prix des Nations 6th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 7th Overall Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 18 (ITT) 2000 1st Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Overall Settimana Ciclistica Lombarda 1st Stage 2 2nd Chrono des Herbiers 4th GP Industria & Artigianato di Larciano 9th Time trial, Olympic Games 9th Overall Giro d'Italia 2001 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Overall Settimana Ciclistica Lombarda 1st Stage 3 3rd Overall Ronde van Nederland 1st Stage 3b (ITT) 3rd Giro dell'Appennino 3rd Chrono des Herbiers 4th Overall Giro d'Italia 4th Giro della Romagna 4th EnBW Grand Prix (with Denis Zanette) 5th GP Industria & Artigianato di Larciano 8th Overall Giro del Trentino 10th Trofeo Pantalica 2002 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 3rd Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme 10th Grand Prix Eddy Merckx (with Marco Velo) 2003 National Road Championships 1st Road race 2nd Time trial 3rd Overall Ronde van Nederland 3rd Grand Prix des Nations 4th Trofeo Melinda 4th Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli 4th Firenze–Pistoia 7th Overall Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 21 (ITT) 7th Giro di Lombardia 8th Overall Danmark Rundt 9th Overall Three Days of De Panne 2004 2nd Overall Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 13 (ITT) 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships 4th Trofeo Laigueglia 5th Veenendaal–Veenendaal 2005 1st Stage 3 Giro del Trentino 3rd Giro del Veneto 6th Overall Giro d'Italia 9th Coppa Placci 2006 Tour de France 1st Stages 7 (ITT) & 19 (ITT) Held after Stages 7–9 2nd Overall Circuit de la Sarthe 4th LuK Challenge Chrono (with Michael Rogers) Giro d'Italia Held after Stages 5 & 7 2008 2nd Giro del Veneto National Road Championships 4th Road race 4th Time trial 2009 4th Raiffeisen Grand Prix 10th Gran Premio Città di Camaiore List of doping cases in cycling Wikimedia Commons has media related to Serhiy Honchar.
