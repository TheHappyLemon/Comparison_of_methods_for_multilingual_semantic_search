Vilnius – Kaunas Railway (Lithuanian: Geležinkelis Vilnius – Kaunas) is one of the main local railways in Lithuania. This railway connects Lithuanian capital Vilnius with the 2nd largest city Kaunas. The railway construction was started in 1859 and finished in 1862. On 4 April 1975, around 20 people died and at least 80 people were injured in the Žasliai railway disaster. On 6 November 1994, the Bražuolė bridge bombing damaged one of the railway bridges, but derailment of trains was avoided.
