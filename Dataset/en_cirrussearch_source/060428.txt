In 2008, she started the season with a surprise run to the final of the Costa Rica Bowl (Grade 3) as a qualifier, losing in straight sets to Eugenie Bouchard. She continued her good form, winning two out of three tournaments. Puig continued good results in small Grade-3 and-4 tournaments. In her first Grade-1 tournament in Lexington, she defeated Charlotte Calhoun before going out to Lauren Embree. She continued to participate in bigger tournaments, though not with as much success as she had in the smaller ones. Puig had her breakthrough season in 2009; she started doing much better in the bigger tournaments. She reached her first Grade-1 final in Casablanca, losing to Mai Grage of Denmark. She continued playing consistently, highlights of the latter months of the year included a semifinal appearance at a Grade-B1 tournament in Tulsa, losing to Bouchard in three sets.

Puig started the year reaching the final of the 32nd International Casablanca Junior Cup (Grade A), falling easily to Sachie Ishizu of Japan. She then reached another final a week later at the Coffee Bowl (G1) losing to An-Sophie Mestach of Belgium in straights. Puig followed that up with a semifinal appearance at a Grade-1 tournament in Barranquilla. Consistent results followed, before a huge Grade-A title at the 27th Copa Gerdau, defeating Jessica Pegula in the final. After a semifinal appearance at another Grade-A calibre tournament, she fell in the quarterfinals of the French Open.

On 16 January, she entered the Australian Open qualifying draw ranked 209, and lost in the second round to Kirsten Flipkens. At the $25k Andrézieux-Bouthéon tournament, she won two qualifying matches but lost in the first round to Magda Linette of Poland. In the following month, Puig played on the qualifying draw of two WTA Tour events, in Bogotá and Monterrey, without being able to get past the first round of the main draw. She received a wildcard to play in the Indian Wells Open qualifying draw, but, in the second round, lost to world No. 66, Eleni Daniilidou. Her breakthrough came when she reached the final of the Poza Rica $25k tournament unseeded. The last two matches prior to the final included wins against tournament seeds No. 4 and 1, although she lost to second seed Yaroslava Shvedova.

In Puerto Rico's Olympic history, Puig is the ninth sportsperson and the first woman to win an Olympic medal. She is the first Latin American representative to win the gold medal in singles and the second to win a medal, after Gabriela Sabatini won silver at the 1988 Summer Olympics. In November, Puig was presented the award for Best Female Athlete in Rio 2016 presented by the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC).

As a result of that injury, she withdrew from the Internationaux de Strasbourg and the French Open.

Puig started her 2019 season at the Auckland Open where she lost in the second round to third seed Hsieh Su-wei. In Sydney, she was defeated in the final round of qualifying by Aliaksandra Sasnovich.

At the US Open, she was defeated in the first round by Margarita Gasparyan. Competing at the French Open, Puig lost her first-round match to 2012 finalist and qualifier, Sara Errani. Puig ended the year ranked 105. She made a comeback after two years at the Madrid Open where she lost to Danielle Collins in the first round, in straight sets. Puig retired in June 2022 due to the cumulative effects of repeated injuries she sustained throughout her career. Puig has had multiple coaches in her career, including Alain De Vos (2008–2014), Ricardo Sánchez (2014–2015), Juan Todero (2015–2018), Kamau Murray and Othmane Garma (2019), Philippe DeHaes, and Diego Veronelli. In August 2020, she announced the return of Juan Todero as her coach. At the end of 2021, she announced Dorian Descloix will be her new coach Puig played one season of World TeamTennis, making her debut in 2019 with the Vegas Rollers for their inaugural season. It had been announced that Puig wanted to return to the Vegas Rollers during the 2020 WTT season. Puig was in a relationship with baseball player Derek Dietrich. The two met when he was playing for the Miami Marlins and she was invited to throw the first pitch; they started dating in early 2017. In 2019, when Dietrich was playing for the Cincinnati Reds, Puig served a first pitch during a game using a tennis racket. Puig became engaged to fellow tennis player Nathan Rakitt in 2021., and they got married on November 11, 2022. After retiring from tennis, Puig found a new passion in marathon running. She joined her then-fiancé, former Georgia Tech tennis player and avid runner Nathan Rakitt, for a run and enjoyed it, so much that they decided to sign up for the 2022 New York City Marathon. Puig was cheered on by Puerto Ricans and finished the New York marathon in just over 4+1⁄2 hours. She and Rakitt got married in San Juan a few days after the New York marathon and planned their marathon running goals when they flew back to their Atlanta home. They plan to run the six major marathons by 2024 to earn the Six Star medal from the Abbott World Major Marathons. Needing to run a sub-3:30 marathon for both the 2023 Boston and London marathons, she reached out to the organizers of both marathons and got a waiver based on her being a pro athlete and her New York results. In between her work with ESPN and the Tennis Channel doing live commentary in Spanish, Puig trains with COROS and coach Derek Dalzell to improve her endurance, pace, nutrition, and recovery.
