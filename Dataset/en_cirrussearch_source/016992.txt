One Ok Rock (Japanese: ワンオクロック, Hepburn: Wan Oku Rokku, stylized in all caps) is a Japanese rock band formed in 2005. The band currently consists of vocalist Takahiro Moriuchi, guitarist, Toru Yamashita, bassist Ryota Kohama, and drummer Tomoya Kanki. Former members include drummer Yu Koyanagi and guitarist Alexander "Alex" Reimon Onizawa. They play varied styles of music, with songs ranging from alternative rock and emo to post-hardcore and pop punk. One Ok Rock was affiliated originally with Amuse, Inc|Avex inc.. ever since their debut in 2007. The band left Amuse on April 1, 2021, and established their own management agency, named 10969 Inc. In the United States, they are signed with record label Avex Mode. One Ok Rock rose to international fame with their 2012 single "The Beginning" from their sixth album Jinsei×Boku=, which led them to concerts and music festivals outside Asia. Following the success, the band started to release their later albums in two versions (Japanese-English and full English) with 2 to 3 different tracks in each version. Their seventh studio album, 35xxxv, became their first album which charted on US Billboard. It peaked at No. 11 on Heatseekers Albums, No. 43 on Independent Albums, No. 23 on the Hard Rock Albums, and No. 1 on the World Albums Chart. The band's eighth album, Ambitions, debuted at No. 106 on the US Billboard 200 and international charts while incorporating more arena rock and pop-rock. In 2019, the band adopted a more electronic and pop sound on their ninth album Eye of the Storm. In 2022, they experimented with more rock-centered sound while still incorporating modern pop-rock for their new album, Luxury Disease. One Ok Rock won Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards for Eastern Breakthrough Male Band in 2016, and Rock Sound Awards for Best International Band in 2017 and Best Live Performance in 2018. The band was also nominated for two Alternative Press Music Awards – Best International Band in 2016 and Best Breakthrough Band in 2017. The foundation for One Ok Rock began on July 29, 2005, when Toru Yamashita, a high school student, wanted to start a band. He invited his childhood friend Ryota Kohama, who was also a member of the hip-hop dance group HEADS they were both in years prior. He told Ryota to learn the bass and asked Alexander Onizawa, who was their senior in school, to join to be their guitarist and his classmate, Yu Koyanagi, to play drums. Toru was searching for a vocalist and found Takahiro Moriuchi, who was in another band called Chivalry of Music performing. Impressed by Taka’s singing skill, Toru insisted him to join One Ok Rock instead. At first, Taka refused despite repeated attempts to sway him, but eventually, he joined the band. The band's name was suggested by Koyanagi Yu which comes from "one o'clock", the time that the band used to practice their music on weekends. They chose to play at one o'clock in the morning because it was cheaper to use the rehearsal space during such hours. However, noticing that the Japanese language made no distinction between R's and L's, "O'CLOCK" transformed into "O'CROCK" or "O'KROCK", which later transformed into "OK ROCK". In addition, One Ok Rock can be expressed as "10969" (wan-ō-ku-ro-ku). The band uses both Japanese and English lyrics in their songs. The band released their self-produced demo CD “Do You Know A Christmas?”. On December 21, 2005. There were only 200 copies of the CD. In 2006, they released 2 EPs, "ONE OK ROCK" and "KEEP IT REAL". After signing with Amuse, Inc. Yu Koyanagi left the band to pursue an acting career and replaced by Tomoya Kanki who was a student at the ESP (Musical Academy) and was already in a band that was not going well. He then joined One Ok Rock in 2006 and became an official member when they debuted in 2007. In 2007, the band released their debut single, "Naihishinsho", reached number 48 on the Oricon Charts and sold 15,000 copies. Followed by their second and third single, " Yume Yume" and "Et Cetera" , followed that success and charted at number 43. After those singles, they released their debut album Zeitakubyō on November 21, 2007, and had their first tour, the Tokyo-Osaka-Nagoya Quattro Tour. They released their second album Beam of Light in May 2008. In an interview with Rockin'On Japan magazine in June 2012, the band said they did not count this album as an album, but rather as a part of growing up as a band. When they made the album, they had not been in the right mood, but felt that they had to make it to grow as a band. The band came up with many sound sources and ended up making a punk album. The album's confused origins were the reason why they would not play any songs from Beam of Light in live performances until recently. Shortly after releasing Beam of Light, later they performed a gig at Shibuya AX. They had planned to release two albums in that one year, so they released "Kanjou Effect" in November 2008. At this point the band had gained more experience and were able to do some more serious recording. They settled into the western sound they lnfluenced by and followed by replacing all their engineers and introducing their music to new producers. This led to some division within the band. Taka and Alex in particular disagreed about how to make this album. On April 5, 2009, Alex was arrested for groping the leg of a twenty-one-year-old female student on a train. He admitted to the charges and the case was settled out of court. The band reached their weakest point at this time. Ryota intended to leave bass and take up guitar. They felt it was impossible for them to add a new member. The band's next single, "Around the World Shounen", which was planned for a May 6 release as the theme song for the TV drama GodHand Teru, and their nationwide tour were both cancelled. In May 2009, it was announced that One Ok Rock would continue on as a 4 piece band without Alex, who went back to the United States. Toru took his place as lead guitar, and the band re-arranged their songs to be played for one guitar. With the new four-member formation, One Ok Rock released the single "Kanzen Kankaku Dreamer" on February 3, 2010. The song peaked at number nine on the Oricon Singles Chart in Japan. After four months, the band released their fourth studio album titled Niche Syndrome. Released on June 9, 2010, the album peaked at number three on the Billboard's Top Albums Sales chart. For the promotion of Niche Syndrome, One Ok Rock embarked on the "This is my own judgement!" tour initially in five Zepp music halls across the nation in 6 days, starting Sendai, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka and ending in a 2-day concert in Tokyo. The second part the tour took place at sixteen different venues until December 11, 2010. They held a final performance in Nippon Budokan, Tokyo on November 28, followed by the release of a concert DVD This is My Budokan?! on February 16, 2011. On August 6, 7 and 8, One Ok Rock headlined Rock in Japan Festival and Summer Sonic Festival, followed by Rising Sun Rock Festival, Monster Bash, Treasure05X, Mad Ollie, Countdown Japan 2010/2011, and Radio Crazy.
