The Loue (French pronunciation: [lu]) is a river of eastern France, a left tributary of the Doubs, which it joins downstream of Dole. It is 122 km (76 mi) long. Its source is a karst spring in the Jura mountains near Ouhans, which at least partly receives its water from the Doubs. This connection with the Doubs was discovered in 1901 when a spillage from the Pernod factory into the Doubs was transmitted into the Loue. The Loue flows through the following departments and towns: Doubs: Ornans, Quingey Jura: Montbarrey Sandre. "Fiche cours d'eau - La Loue (U26-0400)". April McMahon (1994).
