Canal 13 is a Chilean free-to-air television channel. Informally known in Chile as El 13 (The Thirteen), it is the second oldest television station in the country. It was launched on 21 August 1959, on VHF channel 2 of Santiago, in a broadcast led and founded by a group of engineers from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Subsequently, the TV station moved its frequency to VHF channel 13, which gave rise to its current name. In its beginnings, one of its most important milestones was the broadcast of the 1962 FIFA World Cup, which was hosted in Chile. It was originally named Corporación de Televisión de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (Television Corporation of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile) until 2010, when the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile sold most of its shares to Andrónico Luksic Craig's Grupo Luksic [es]. In 2017, Grupo Luksic acquired full ownership of the channel. Its central studios are located in the Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte Television Centre, which since the 1980s has housed the channel's production and broadcast facilities. The complex is located in Providencia, Santiago Metropolitan Region and has 5 hectares of infrastructure. Since 1998, these dependencies have been named after the station's deceased executive director, Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte, who was one of the longest-serving men in this position. On November 25, 1952, the first RCA Victor brand industrial television equipment was received in Santiago, Chile, which was acquired by the Catholic University in association with the Chilean subsidiary of the North American firm. Two teams were immediately created at the university to supervise the use of the system: a technical team, led by engineer Julio del Río, and an artistic team under the direction of Germán Becker. On December 12 of that year, the first experimental program was broadcast in a closed circuit from the Auditorium of the School of Physics of the Catholic University; The broadcast had several technical errors but was seen as a success. In January 1953, the University's television department collaborated with Radio Minería for a special broadcast of its program La Cadena de la Amistad, becoming the first public television broadcast in Chile. In 1959, Pedro Caraball was appointed head of the Electronics Department; At the same time, a 100 W audio transmitter was built and new Philips industrial equipment was purchased, with which the first test transmissions were made on July 17. On August 21 of the same year at 7:00 p.m., the experimental transmissions formally began from an attic on the fourth floor of the Central House and with a receiver installed in the reception of El Diario Ilustrado, through VHF channel 2 and broadcasting a schedule of three films per week; these transmissions would be interrupted on December 31 of that year due to an accident that affected the transmitter. In January 1960, the Television Department was created, and Juan Ángel Torti was appointed as its director to officially shape up the station. The test transmissions end on Saturday, April 15, 1961 at 6:00 p.m., when the television station of the Catholic University begins its official transmissions through channel 13; since the 3rd of the same month, test broadcasts had begun between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. to adjust the equipment. To do this, a studio was built in the University's Central House, from which Recuerdos de la Pérgola de las Flores, the channel's first program, was broadcast. Also, El show de Antonio Prieto and Tricotilandia, the first entertainment programs on Chilean television, were made in the same studio. These two were the first to introduce commercial advertising to television. In 1962, and now definitively using channel 13, the channel successfully broadcast the 1962 FIFA World Cup which took place in Chile, thanks to new equipment—which included 5 cameras, a transmitter, and a link team—that it received. on March 29 of that year; Canal 13 was in charge of broadcasting the matches of Chile vs Italy, Germany vs Switzerland, the quarter-finals, the semi-finals and the final of the championship. After the World Cup ended, the channel closed its broadcasts for almost a month to make technical adjustments, resuming these on Sunday, July 22 with the broadcast of the first part of La pérgola de las flores, which was divided into four parts broadcast every Sunday; that day, presentations by the musical groups The Dreamers, The Strangers, and María Teresa Larraín were also broadcast. In August of that year, Show dominical began to air; in 1965, it moved to Saturdays as Sábados alegres, and later with its extension in length it was renamed Sábados Gigantes: the oldest and most successful variety program in Latin America, hosted by Mario Kreutzberger, better known as Don Francisco. On October 2, 1962, the channel's studios were officially inaugurated, in a ceremony headed by Darío Aliaga, Eduardo Tironi and Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez. In 1963, the creation of the first Press Department of Chilean television took place, under the direction of journalist Leonardo Cáceres. In the same year, the Dramatic Department was created, under the direction of Hugo Miller, and the teletheater The Greenhouse (1963) debuted, starring Malú Gatica —who was returning to the country after her time in Hollywood —and which marked the debut of Sonia Viveros. The following year, the first national fiction series began to be broadcast: This is My Family, starring Malú Gatica herself. In 1964, Channel 13 began broadcasting seven days a week, also covering the presidential elections on September 4 of that year, where Eduardo Frei Montalva was elected president. On April 1, 1965, the series El liter 4916 premiered with great ratings success; Meanwhile, The Secret History of the Big News became the first documentary program on Chilean television, and on December 27 of that same year, the videotape system debuted on the channel by recording the teletheater The Browning Version with received equipment. in the middle of that year, launched with the help of Argentine technicians; Four days later, at 11:45 p.m. on December 31, 1965, the channel broadcast its first program recorded on videotape: a musical presentation by Marianela and Los Gatos, as well as a greeting from Eduardo Tironi (station director). In 1967, the channel achieved another success with the comedy Juani en Society, starring Sonia Viveros and Silvia Piñeiro. In October of the same year, it received new mobile transmission equipment that included a videotape system, thus allowing the recording of outdoor scenes. On August 9, 1968, the first satellite transmission was received , corresponding to a live transmission from the Chilean Embassy in Washington D.C. (United States) and occurred on the occasion of the inauguration of the Longovilo earth station; on July 20 and 21, 1969, it covered via satellite the transmission of man's arrival on the Moon in conjunction with Channel 9 and National Television of Chile —the latter, still in experimental transmissions—. On March 1, 1970, the Teletrece news program debuted, the oldest news program on Chilean television currently on air; in 1971, the channel became an associate member of the European Broadcasting Union; and in 1972, the Angelito de Canal 13, the first mascot of Channel 13, created by Enrique Bustamante, and priest Raúl Hasbún took over as the channel's new director. On December 24, 1972, the channel extended its transmissions to the cities of San Fernando and Curicó on frequency 5, known in both cities as "Canal 5", officially beginning its broadcasts on January 3. 1973. On February 8, 1973, Channel 5's broadcasts, a subsidiary station of Channel 13 in Concepción, began. The current legislation (dated in 1970) did not contemplate the geographical expansion of the university channels, so there was great controversy regarding a campaign led by Channel 13 to achieve national coverage, largely due to its editorial line, which was in opposition to the then-current government, in notorious counterpart with National Television of Chile and Channel 9 of the University of Chile. On September 11, 1973 - the day of the coup d'état against the government of Salvador Allende - Channel 13 was the only television outlet authorized to go on the air by order of the Military Government Junta; for three days, Channel 13 broadcast throughout the country using TVN's frequency network, which was left off the air, as was Channel 9. In 1974, due to problems with the new rector of the Catholic University, Jorge Swett Madge - appointed by the Military Junta -, Raúl Hasbún resigned from his position; In his place, Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte took over. Likewise, the programming increased, and starting in March of that year it began its daily broadcasts at 9:00 a.m. and ended at 1:00 a.m., subsequently, it retransmitted its programs on a delayed basis to La Serena and Coquimbo after signing an agreement with Canal 8 UCV Televisión in 1975. In 1976, it broadcast for the first time in conjunction with National Television the matches of the Chilean team in the Davis Cup of that year. in addition to the playoff match of the Copa Libertadores final between Cruzeiro and River Plate at the National Stadium. It also managed to extend its signal to other places in Chile, since in November 1976 it inaugurated a repeater in Valparaíso and Viña del Mar through channel 8, a frequency that until February 1969 belonged to UCV Televisión. In December 1976, the channel's authorities signed an agreement with the Universidad del Norte Television Network that allowed it to retransmit its programs in Antofagasta, Arica, Calama, Chuquicamata, Iquique, María Elena, and Tocopilla. In 1975, the Treasury ended the subsidies that it had periodically granted to university television stations since their inception. In this way, Canal 13 began to finance itself solely with advertising and contributions from the Catholic University. However, soon the advertising revenues allowed the channel to operate as a commercial station and additionally deliver profits to the studio. A symbol of this new situation were the programs made by director Gonzalo Bertrán and presenter César Antonio Santis, both arriving from National Television in 1976, first with musical specials with the participation of foreign artists, and then with two-hour variety shows, beginning with Esta noche fiesta in 1977. On April 12, 1978, color television transmissions were authorized in Chile, establishing the American NTSC standard as official; It took Canal 13 only three months to adapt - acquiring four RCA TK-760 cameras and a TK-28 equipment -, and in June, together with National Television, it broadcasts the Soccer World Cup from Argentina with this technology. On December 2 of that year, together with TVN and the channels of the University of Chile and the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, they organized and broadcast the OTI Song Festival of that year, which was held at the Municipal Theater of Santiago. Meanwhile, on December 8 and 9, the channels come together again to broadcast the first Teletón. In 1981, the soap operas La Madrastra and Casagrande, and the news programs Teletarde and Telenoche, premiered. Since then, the channel's production increased, and on May 15, 1983, it inaugurated its Television Center in Providencia, leaving behind the studios on Lira Street; Studio D in said place - where La Madrastra was recorded - had suffered a fire on July 20, 1981. One of the first programs produced in the new studios is the variety program Martes 13, launched on July 7 of that year live from Studio 3. On the other hand, Canal 13 continued to expand, and on August 21, 1984, it premiered its signal in Talca through channel 8, while on December 18 it extended to Chillán and Los Angeles through channel 13. On March 3, 1985, Channel 13 extended the edition of Teletrece that day until around 1 in the morning in the context of the earthquake in Algarrobo. Likewise, on March 8 and 9, the channel organized the first edition of the Chile ayuda a Chile campaign to gather help for the victims of the earthquake, in a broadcast that lasted more than 30 hours. On September 6 of that year, it began broadcasting in Constitución through channel 9. In 1986, in conjunction with National Television, it again broadcast the match that the Chilean team played in the Davis Cup that year and premiered in the first half of the year the telenovela Ángel Malo, an adaptation of a Brazilian telenovela from 1975. Likewise, during the second half of the year, it broadcasts Secreto de Familia. That same year, Canal 13 continued its expansion, reaching Cauquenes (channel 7) and Temuco (channel 4), beginning its transmissions in the latter city on July 18. In June, it again broadcasts the World Cup together with TVN, this time Mexico 1986, and on July 30 it inaugurates the studios of Channel 5 in Concepción, built in the likeness of the Providencia Television Center. In 1987, Channel 13 reached the cities of Puerto Montt (channel 13), Osorno (channel 9, since October 28), Angol (channel 10), San Felipe, Lebu, Lautaro, Traiguén and Saladillo. From April 1 to 5, it broadcast the visit of Pope John Paul II to Chile live as the official channel at the request of the Chilean episcopate, being the only television station that broadcast the entire events of the visit. On the other hand, on August 7 and 8, Sábados Gigantes celebrates 25 years of existence in a 25-hour program. Finally, between October 10 and 25, it broadcasts jointly with National Television the U-20 Soccer World Cup held in Chile that year. During 1990, Universidad Católica de Chile Televisión achieved national coverage, reaching from Arica (channel 8) to Quellón (channel 5). On May 29, 1991, the channel broadcast together with Televisión Nacional de Chile the final match of the 1991 Copa Libertadores with equal high ratings for both channels. The broadcast was presented by Pedro Carcuro, Ignacio Hernández (for TVN) and Alberto Fouillioux (for Channel 13). On June 5, both channels again broadcast the final of the 1991 Copa Libertadores, this time being the second leg, also with high ratings for both stations. The broadcast was directed by Gonzalo Bertrán and presented by Pedro Carcuro, Sergio Livingstone (for TVN), Alberto Fouillioux and Julio Martínez (for Channel 13). Additionally, on June 28, it adds to its program schedule the American series The Simpsons, which has been successful over the years and has established itself as an iconic program on Channel 13. National coverage is expanded once again, arriving during 1991 to Vallenar, Rancagua and Punta Arenas. At the beginning of 1992, the channel began to broadcast in the communes of Petorca and Illapel. In Punta Arenas, the signal began transmitting on May 15, 1991. Its broadcast was one day later than in Santiago and consisted of 6 hours of programming, which was extended over time. This continued until April 1993, when this system was replaced by the live signal via satellite from Santiago. On March 16, 1992, a restructuring of the press department debuted, with Eduardo Riveros taking over at Teletarde; With this, Jeanette Frazier and the announcer Augusto Gatica left the news reading, who became the official voice-over of the channel along with Christian Gordon until August 1997. In addition, on December 26, Sábado Gigante was broadcast for the last time from Santiago, since then the program migrated to the Univision network in the United States. In addition, the soap operas Marrón Glacé and Doble Juego are released; and Channel 13 achieves definitive national coverage with its arrival in the Aysén Region. In December 1994, the last stage of the Television Center was inaugurated with the presence of President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle along with Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte, thus becoming the television channel with the largest infrastructure area in the country until then with 30,000 square meters. That same year, Punta Arenas began to be broadcast in Compressed Digital Image format via satellite from the Channel's Press Department. On May 1, 1995, the renewal of the press department debuted, with Javier Miranda in Teletrece, Eduardo Riveros in Teletarde, and Jorge Díaz Saenger or Loreto Delpin in Telenoche. On July 25, Martes 13 is broadcast for the last time, and on October 16, Viva el Lunes premieres. In 1996 the channel broadcast alone the matches played by the Chilean team in the Davis Cup, which will be repeated in 1997 and 1998. Furthermore, after several years, in February it extended its signal to Coyhaique, on channel 6; however, on November 13, Channel 13 ended local production in Concepción after 23 years due to economic problems, thus turning Channel 5 into a full-time repeater of programming broadcast from Santiago. On April 24 of that same year, Channel 13 broadcast the Qualifiers for France 98, broadcasting the Chilean Soccer Team's away matches against Venezuela, Argentina, and Ecuador. In 1997 it began to broadcast uninterruptedly 24 hours a day on weekends; in addition, during this period, telenovelas such as Adrenalina, Playa Salvaje, Marparaíso, and Fuera de Control were premiered. In 1998, Channel 13 was awarded the broadcast rights to the Copa Libertadores de América, which previously belonged to Megavisión, and the children's program Cachureos, which left Televisión Nacional to have 4 seasons on the channel. Likewise, in July it broadcast for the last time alone, a confrontation between the Chilean team in the Davis Cup, facing Colombia. On July 18, Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte, director of the television station since 1974, died; in his replacement, Rodrigo Jordán took over on August 6. In 1999 it began broadcasting on the Internet on its website canal13.cl, and broadcast the religious microspace Reflexiones for the last time. On June 18 the channel changes its corporate image, eliminating its classic logo and mascot. In January 2010, after a crisis caused by low rating levels and the failure of several programs, several channel authority figures resigned. Among them the executive director Mercedes Ducci, the director of the press area Pilar Bernstein, and the general manager Sergio Cavagnaro. After Ducci's resignation, the president of the Corporation's Advisory Council, Jorge Herrera, takes over as executive director on an interim basis. In April, the newly appointed rector of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, Ignacio Sánchez, appointed Marcelo von Chrismar Werth as the new Executive Director, while in June, the reinstatement of Patricio Hernández as Director of Programming and journalist Eliana Rozas as Director of Press is announced. On the other hand, it was decided that Deportes 13 would become directly dependent on the Press Department, ceasing to be an autonomous area of the channel. The same situation occurred with the reporting area. This, during a climate of crisis within the channel due to low viewership, increased financial losses and the failure of a large part of the new programs. Likewise, there are the first signs of stagnation in advertising investments, a product of competition from the Internet.
