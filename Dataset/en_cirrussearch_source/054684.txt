Talal Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah was elected as President of the OCA on 8 July 2023. However, on 30 July 2023, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) asked Randhir Singh, who was previously the acting president, to continue as the Acting President of the OCA, while the IOC investigated the OCA presidential election of 2023. On 13 October 2023, the IOC ethics committee asked the OCA to annul its 2023 elections due to Talal’s candidacy not fulfilling the eligibility conditions defined by the OCA Constitution and election interference by his brother Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah. The headquarters of the OCA is located at Kuwait City, Kuwait. In 1948, during the 1948 Summer Olympics, Asian National Olympic Committees (NOCs) decided to organize the Asian Games, under the auspices of Asian Games Federation. The following year the Asian Games Federation was organized. Decades later this would be reorganized and the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) was established in New Delhi on 16 November 1982. The International Olympic Committee recognized the OCA within the same year. The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) together with the Asian Electronic Sports Federation (AESF) announced a new campaign for the upcoming 2022 Asian Games. The campaign, ‘Road to Asian Games’ will be officially organized by the AESF and aims to bring the Olympic spirit to eSports and introduce an education program for participating eSports athletes. On 8 July 2023, Talal Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah was elected as President of the OCA. However, the IOC refused to recognise the election and on 30 July 2023, the IOC in a letter asked Randhir Singh, who was previously the Acting President of the OCA, to continue as acting president while the IOC investigated the 2023 OCA presidential election. In the following table, the year in which the NOC was recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is also given if it is different from the year in which the NOC was created. The NOC for Macau is recognized by the OCA, but is not recognized by the IOC and does not compete in the Olympic Games. The OCA also includes the NOCs of Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, and Palestine. East Timor is the newest member, joining in 2003. The OCA includes the transcontinental country of Kazakhstan, but does not include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Turkey, and Russia, although they are located wholly or mostly in Asia. Israel, however, was excluded after the Munich Massacre, upon the claim that their delegation security at the Asian Games would be a problem. The South Caucasian countries opted to join the European Olympic Committees after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Israel was a member of the Asian Games Federation, but was excluded from the Olympic Council of Asia upon its re-incorporation in 1981. Since 1994, Israel is a member of the European Olympic Committees (EOC) instead.  Bahrain  Iran  Iraq  Jordan  Kuwait  Lebanon  Oman  Palestine  Qatar  Saudi Arabia  Syria  United Arab Emirates  Yemen  Afghanistan  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  Uzbekistan  Bangladesh  Bhutan  India  Maldives    Nepal  Pakistan  Sri Lanka  China  Hong Kong  Macau  Japan  North Korea  South Korea  Chinese Taipei  Mongolia  Brunei  Cambodia  Indonesia  Laos  Malaysia  Myanmar  Philippines  Singapore  Thailand  Timor-Leste  Vietnam Source: Source: In General Assembly (GA) (OCA Annual General Assembly) hosts of various competitions are introduced and important decisions are made about the countries and sports that covered by OCA. 1st: 1982 in New Delhi, India. 2nd: 1983 in , . 3rd: 1984 in Seoul, South Korea. 4th: 1985 in , . 5th: 1986 in , . 6th: 1987 in , . 7th: 1988 in , . 8th: 1989 in , . 9th: 1990 in Beijing, China. 10th: 1991 in , . 11th: 1992 in , . 12th: 1993 in , . 13th: 1994 in , . 14th: 23 May 1995 in Seoul, South Korea. 15th: 1996 in Bangkok, Thailand. 16th: 1997 in , . 17th: 1998 in , . 18th: 1999 in Kuwait City, Kuwait. 19th: 12 November 2000 in Busan, South Korea. 20th: 2001 in Aomori, Japan. 21st: 2002 in Busan, South Korea. 22nd: 24 Jan 2003 in Kuwait City, Kuwait. 23rd: 2004 in Doha, Qatar. 24th: 2005 in Guangzhou, China. 25th: 2006 in Doha, Qatar. 26th: 16 April 2007 in Kuwait City, Kuwait. 27th: 2008 in Bali, Indonesia. 28th: 3 July 2009 in Singapore. 29th: 2010 in Guangzhou, China. 30th: 2011 in Tokyo, Japan. 31st: 2012 in Macau.
