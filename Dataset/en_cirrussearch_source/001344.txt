The Indonesian mountain weasel (Mustela lutreolina) is a species of weasel that lives on the islands of Java and Sumatra in Indonesia at elevations over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). They live in mountainous, tropical, and rainforest areas. Indonesian mountain weasels have a body length of 280–300 mm (11–12 in) and a tail length of 130–150 mm (5–6 in). They are reddish-brown in color. The Indonesian mountain weasel is endangered due to hunting, fur trade, and habitat destruction.[citation needed] There are no recognized subspecies of the Indonesian mountain weasel. Indonesian mountain weasels are carnivorous, and are especially adapted to eating rodents. They are able to kill prey much larger than themselves due to their speed and agility.
