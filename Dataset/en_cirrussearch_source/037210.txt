Aivars is a Latvian masculine given name. It is borne by over 13,000 men in Latvia and in 2006 was the sixth most popular man's name in the country. Its nameday is celebrated on 29 January.

It is a Latvian equivalent of the Old Scandinavian name Ivar, one of a group of Old Scandinavian names that first occurred in Courland between the 6th and 10th centuries, which in the more obviously Scandinavian form Ivars is borne by a further 9,900+ Latvians and in 2006 was the ninth most popular man's name.
