The World Choir Games (formerly named the Choir Olympics) is the largest global choral festival and competition. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation for choirs from all over the world, regardless of their country of origin, race, genre of music or artistic ambitions, its motto is "Singing together brings nations together". The Games originated from the idea to bring people together through singing in peaceful competition, showing that unity of nations through the arts can be effectively and illustratively demonstrated and challenged. The focus of the Games is on participation above winning, and it aims to inspire people to "experience the strength of interaction, challenging personality and community equally by singing together". The most recent host of the Games was Gangneung, South Korea, from 3 to 13 July 2023 (postponed one year from the original 4 to 14 July 2022). The 2024 host city of Auckland, New Zealand, has also been announced. The choir singer Günter Titsch organised the first transnational choir competition with participants from Hungary and Germany in Budapest, beyond the then "Iron Curtain", as early as 1988. To further develop and expand the concept, Titsch then founded the support association Interkultur e.V. in 1990 as the parent organisation for the competitions. The association's name was intended to express the organisers' aim of uniting different cultures through their events. The first international Choir Olympics organised by Interkultur, later renamed World Choir Games, were held in Linz, Austria, in 2000, in the style of the Olympic Games, and involved choirs from 60 countries. An integral part of the Games is that they are not only open to ensembles with previous competitive experience. Choirs can decide for themselves whether to participate in the competition and are not dependent on a formal invitation from the initiators. The Games are hosted biennially (every even year) in a pre-selected city across the globe, where choirs compete in selected categories. In 2012, for instance, there were 23 categories, and in 2016 there were 29 categories, among them "Senior Choirs" and "University Choirs". The Games consist of competitions in two classes (Champions and Open), festival concerts, artistic workshops, and various ceremonies. During the competition, choirs compete for gold, silver, bronze, or "Successful Participation" awards. Medals are awarded in the Champions Competition, and diplomas are awarded in the Open Competition. The choir that attains the highest point and a gold medal in a category during the Champions Competition is awarded the title of "Champion of the World Choir Games" for that category. As part of the festival aspect of the Games choirs may also choose to participate in artistic workshops featuring renowned choral instructors, as well as friendship concerts and free public concerts where choirs share their music with choristers and audiences from different parts of the world. Ceremonies that form part of the Games include opening and closing ceremonies where up to 20,000 choristers join in a single venue, as well as the award ceremonies where the outcomes of the Open Competition and Champions Competition are announced. During the proceedings of the Games, the host for the next edition of the Games is usually also announced.[citation needed] The European Culture Award, which honours contributions to a peaceful Europe, has been awarded to the support association Interkultur in 2006 and 2016. At the World Choir Games 2010, then US President Barack Obama sent a message of greeting to the participating choirs, in which he acknowledged the contribution of the Games towards international understanding.

Participation in the event has been open to all choirs since its foundation.

(Participation in WCG 2016) In connection to the Choir Olympics 2004 in Bremen, the support association was accused of "non-transparent financial dealings". According to newspaper reports, participating choirs were encouraged to arrange their accommodation via the agency "M&C Music Contact", which was said to have a close relationship to INTERKULTUR e.V. The agency justified the criticised price level by stating that the accommodation packages offered would also include a contribution to the organisational expenses, free admission to the competition concerts and a complimentary city tour. Participants from "poorer countries" would also have had to pay a reduced participation fee. In this context, the association organ of the German Singers' Association insinuated a lack of distinction between commercial and non-profit activities. Günter Titsch, the founder of the Choir Olympics and chairman of Interkultur, pointed out that during the event in Bremen the sponsoring association had provided free accommodation and meals for 2000 members of children's and youth choirs but admitted that Interkultur would work for a better organisation and a clearer demarcation at future Olympics. The public attorney's office in Giessen stated on 18 September 2004 that they did not see any grounds for investigation, as all participants had been informed in advance of the related expenses.
