Pokrovsk (Ukrainian: Покровськ, IPA: [poˈkrɔu̯sʲk] ; Russian: Покровск), formerly known as Krasnoarmiysk (until 2016) and Grishino (until 1934), is a city and the administrative center of Pokrovsk Raion in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. Prior to 2020, it was incorporated as a city of oblast significance. Its population is approximately 60,127 (2022 estimate). 2016–present: Pokrovsk (Ukrainian: Покровськ; Russian: Покровск) 1964–2016: Krasnoarmiysk (Ukrainian: Красноармійськ) or Krasnoarmeysk (Russian: Красноармейск) 1938–1964: Krasnoarmeyskoye (Russian: Красноармейское) or Krasnoarmiyske (Ukrainian: Красноармійське) 1934–1938: Postyshevo (Russian: Постышево) or Postysheve (Ukrainian: Постишеве) 1884–1934: Grishino (Russian: Гришино) or Hryshyne (Ukrainian: Гришине) Pokrovsk was founded as Grishino in 1875 by a decision of the Ministry of Railways of the Russian Empire authorizing a railway station. The village had two thousand inhabitants. In 1881, a locomotive depot which became one of the main locomotive repair companies, Ekaterinoslavskaya railway, was built in the town. Two years later, in 1883, there was an enlargement to the station building; the central portion survives to this day. In May 1884, trains finally began transiting the rail station in Grishino. With the development of the railway station, Grishino grew and there were new businesses, in particular for exploitation of underground minerals, starting with coal. By 1913, the population around Grishino station had more than doubled to about 4.5 thousand people. After the Russian Civil War ravaged Russia as a whole, Grishino station continued its growth and by 1925 had a locomotive depot, a brick factory, and six mines. The name of the station was changed to Postyshevo in 1934 to honor Pavel Postyshev, and in 1938, the name of the city became Krasnoarmeyskoe, commemorating the Soviet Red Army, after Postyshev was repressed during the Great Purge. World War II heavily impacted the population of the city. The first Axis forces to arrive were Italians, followed by the Germans who occupied it on October 19, 1941. German forces proceeded to forcibly transfer many civilians by train to labor camps in Austria. Many residents defended their hometown. 8295 Soviet soldiers perished on the battlefield, and 4788 residents of the town were killed in World War II. The city witnessed an atrocity when its Jewish community was murdered in midwinter 1942. Furthermore, in February 1943, the Red Army perpetrated the Massacre of Grischino. On September 7, 1943, the town was liberated for good by Red Army troops. In the 1950s, in the post-war period, the city renewed its industrial and residential construction. In the Russo-Ukrainian War, that is, since the spring of 2014, the city is near the frontline with the separatist Donetsk People's Republic. In May 2016, the city was renamed following decommunization laws to Pokrovsk, honoring the Intercession of the Theotokos known as Pokrova in Ukrainian. On 7 August 2023 during the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russian missiles struck the city twice. Nine people were reported dead from the strike, and 82 wounded. The population of Pokrovsk as of August 1, 2017 was 75,205 people.
