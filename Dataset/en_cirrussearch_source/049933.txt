SC Dnipro-1 (Ukrainian: СК «Дніпро-1») is a professional Ukrainian football team from Dnipro. While not officially a successor of FC Dnipro, SC Dnipro-1 took over all of the infrastructure of the former club including its academy. Founded in November of 2015, SC Dnipro-1 competes in the Ukrainian Premier League, having been promoted from the First League in 2019. Founded in 2015, the club has been officially registered as a limited liability society "Sports Club Dnipro-1" (Russian: Общество с ограниченной ответственностью “Спортивный клуб “Днепр-1”). The club owners are Maksym Bereza and Andriy Rusol, while Hennadiy Polonskyi is mentioned as one of founders. Former Ukrainian international footballer Andriy Rusol who spent 8 seasons in FC Dnipro as a footballer came to the club in 2019 after bankruptcy of FC Dnipro where he also was one of that club's officials for some six years. SC Dnipro-1 adopted an emblem and name similar to the Special Tasks Patrol Police Dnipro-1 which represents the Lisovskyi tryzub. The Dnipro-1, a Ukrainian volunteer battalion, was formed during the initial phase of the Russo-Ukrainian War (War in Donbas) and used to be led by Yuriy Bereza (Maksym Bereza's father), a deputy of head of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast State Administration led by Ihor Kolomoyskyi at that time. The Professional Football League of Ukraine reviewed the matter of admitting the club SC Dnipro-1 on 21 June 2017. On 6 July 2017, it was announced that SC Dnipro-1 would adopt the FC Dnipro football school. The same day SC Dnipro-1 announced its squad for the upcoming 2017–18 Ukrainian Second League season, having a number of well known footballers in Ukraine such as Yevhen Cheberyachko, Serhiy Kravchenko and many others. Its first game on professional level the club played on 9 July 2017 hosting FC Bukovyna Chernivtsi as part of the 2017–18 Ukrainian Cup. Its first official league game the club played next week on 15 July 2017 hosting FC Metalist 1925 Kharkiv as part of the 2017–18 Ukrainian Second League. That season Dnipro-1 became the second club in history of the Ukrainian Cup that reached the semifinals while competing at the third tier and also earned promotion by placing the first place in its group. As champion of the 2018–19 Ukrainian First League Dnipro-1 promoted to the Ukrainian Premier League in 2019. Due to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Dnipro-1 completed 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League campaign at Košická futbalová aréna in Košice, Slovakia, while conducting training sessions in nearby Malá Ida and completing domestic league fixtures in Uzhhorod. Multiple members of the first team relocated to Košice temporarily for the duration of the campaign. During its 2023–24 season, the club as a vice-champion of the UPL set a new anti-record among Ukrainian clubs being eliminated out of all three European club competitions within a month. In 2023, the SC Dnipro-1 deservedly entered the Top 200 companies by income for 2022, which indicates its successful activities and significant contribution to the global economy. FIFA placed a transfer onto the club for the 2023-2024 winter break following legal negotiations between the club and its former manager Igor Jovicevic. In addition to Jovicevic, Oleksandr Kucher admitted that he also was not get compensated by the club as well, but yet does not rush with pursuing his claim in international institutions. In 2018 FC Dnipro was forced into bankruptcy by FIFA due to multiple legal claims for failing to pay its promised monetary compensation to players and managers. Among members of the former football club Dnipro that never got paid, there are Egídio Pereira Júnior, Danilo Sousa Campos, manager Juande Ramos and his coaching staff, Jaba Kankava, Vitaliy Mandzyuk, and others. On 22 February 2021, FIFA dismissed the claim of Jaba Kankava who appealed with a request to recognize SC Dnipro-1 a sports successor of FC Dnipro in order to recover his unpaid salary from FC Dnipro. Other former players perceive the creation of SC Dnipro-1 as a type of scheme. As of 31 March 2024 Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.
