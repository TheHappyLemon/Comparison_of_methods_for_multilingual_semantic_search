Ristna Lighthouse (Estonian: Ristna tuletorn) is a lighthouse located in Ristna Point, K천pu Peninsula, on the island of Hiiumaa (on the coast of the Baltic Sea) in Estonia. The lighthouse was built in 1874, as a result of constant fogs, which made the old K천pu lighthouse nearly invisible. The main reason for the decision to build the lighthouse was to warn sailors of drifting sea ice; which caused a major obstacle in the Gulf of Finland. The current iron metal structure of the lighthouse was built in 1874. The lighthouse survived World War I with small amounts of damage; however, to improve the lighthouse's stability, the structure was cast in concrete in 1920.
