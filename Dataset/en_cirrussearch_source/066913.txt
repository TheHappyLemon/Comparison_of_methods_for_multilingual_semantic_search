The airport is located 27 km (16 miles) south of the capital Yaounde, near Nsimalen in Cameroon's Centre Province. Starting operations in 1991, Nsimalen was built to supersede the old international airport in Yaounde that was getting absorbed by the rapid growth of the city, it was also too close to the oil deposits of SCDP ("Société Camerounaise de Dépôts Pétroliers" or Cameroon Oil Storage Company).
