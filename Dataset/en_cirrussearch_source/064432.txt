In His Own Words is described in the official synopsis as "an incredibly raw, unique perspective into the mind of Jahseh Onfroy, which sees the late cultural mover give insight on topics that many artists don't explore in a public manner, ranging from how he views himself, to his place in the world and society as a whole."

He expressed regret for handling certain controversies in manners he had previously. For example, X said he wish he clarified further on topics in his 2016 interview with Adam22 on the No Jumper podcast. X mentioned that he should have been clearer in the podcast in which he described a fight with a gay cell mate in juvy, stating he wished he had clarified that he did not attack his cell mate for the fact that he was gay, calling his discussion of the topic "negligent and stupid", but stated, "Everybody needs to realize at the time I was still a kid." The mentioned juvy fight was a topic which was a matter of controversy in news and social media during his career.
