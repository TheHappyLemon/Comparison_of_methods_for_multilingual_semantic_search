In January 2008, he moved to the German Bundesliga where he had remained since; he first joined VfL Wolfsburg, before moving to 1. FC Nürnberg late into the 2013 summer transfer window. Following Nürnberg's relegation at the end of the 2013–14 season, he joined Eintracht Frankfurt in July 2014. Hasebe made his debut with the Japan national team in 2006. He has earned 114 international caps and scored twice, making him one of ten most capped players in the history of the team.

In 2004, he was honoured with the J.League Cup New Hero Award and selected as a member of J.League team of the year. He was also the Urawa Fans' Player of the Year that season. The Reds won the championship in the 2006 J1 League for the first time in the club history and the first Asian title of the 2007 AFC Champions League. It was reported in October 2007 that Italian Serie A side A.C. Siena was keen to sign Hasebe the following January. However, he signed for Bundesliga side Wolfsburg becoming the first Japanese player ever to play for the Wolves. In 2009, he became the second Japanese player to win the Bundesliga title. On 29 April 2010, it was announced that Hasebe extended his contract with Wolfsburg until 2012.

On 2 September 2013, Hasebe signed a three-year contract with 1. FC Nürnberg. Hasebe moved to Bundesliga team Eintracht Frankfurt for the 2014–15 season, where he was an instant starter, missing just one competitive match in his first season. In the 2015–16 season, he was also a midfielder for Frankfurt, who only managed to stay in the relegation play-off against Hasebe's former club Nuremberg. Under Frankfurt's new coach Niko Kovač, the Japanese player was called up for the first time at centre-back at the end of October 2016 as a central link in a five-man backline and played in this position from then on.

With his 309th appearance on 6 June 2020 against 1. FSV Mainz 05, Hasebe became the record Asian player in the Bundesliga. At the start of the 2020–21 season, the Japanese player was the oldest player in the Bundesliga at the age of 36. Following David Abraham's departure of the team in January 2021, Hasebe led Eintracht onto the field as captain for most of the time without a new permanent captain.
