The 1900 Olympic Croquet doubles tournament was held on 22 July 1900. Gaston Aumoitte and Georges Johin, who had taken first and second in the singles one-ball event, were the winning pair: very little else is known about the event, including the competition format or if any other doubles teams entered. This was the only appearance of the event at the Olympics; it was one of three croquet competitions in 1900. Croquet was one of the first Olympic sports open to women (with only sailing having female competitors before croquet, due to that sport taking place earlier in 1900); it is unknown whether any women competed in the doubles.
