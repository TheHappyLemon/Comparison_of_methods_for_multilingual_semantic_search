Lechaio (Greek: Λέχαιο) is a village in the municipal unit of Assos-Lechaio in Corinthia, Greece. It is situated on the coast of the Gulf of Corinth, 8 km west of Corinth and 12 km southeast of Kiato. The Greek National Road 8 passes through the town. It had a railway station on the Piraeus–Patras railway, but passenger service on this line was halted in 2009. Ancient Lechaeum was one of the ports of Ancient Corinth. It was connected to Corinth by a pair of strong walls. In the 390 BC Battle of Lechaeum, a Spartan mora (regiment) was defeated by the Athenians led by Iphicrates at Lechaeum. The small airport was built by the Germans in the World War II to serve as a military air-base for the control of the south-eastern Mediterranean area. In tunnels under the airport, a large inventory of weapons and many barrels of oil were stored by the German army.
