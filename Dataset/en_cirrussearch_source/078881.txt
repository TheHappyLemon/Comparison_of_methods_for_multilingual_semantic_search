As an actress, she is known for her roles as Siyotanka in the American comedy series Poor Paul (2009–2011) and Sasha in the British musical drama series Almost Never (2019–2021). Wyatt has served as a judge on various television dance competition shows, including Got to Dance (2009–2014), Live to Dance (2011), Got to Dance Poland (2013), and Taking The Next Step (2016–2018). She has also appeared as a contestant on British reality television shows, including The Jump (2014), Celebrity MasterChef (2015), and Dancing on Ice (2022). Wyatt was born in Warrensburg, Missouri, a town near Kansas City, Missouri, and is of English, Scottish, German, and Swiss-German descent. She began dancing at the age of seven. At the age of 14, she earned a scholarship to study in New York's Joffrey Ballet and the Broadway Dance Center. At the age of seventeen, she graduated from high school and flew to Las Vegas to audition for cruise ship and casino shows. She worked in a revue on Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas for two years. In 2001, Wyatt moved to Los Angeles despite getting an offer from Hubbard St. Dance Co. In 2002, Wyatt became a dancer on the comedy sketch show Cedric the Entertainer Presents. In 2003, Robin Antin saw Wyatt in Nick Lachey's music video "Shut Up" and asked her to join the Pussycat Dolls, along with Nicole Scherzinger, Melody Thornton, Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, and Jessica Sutta. The group achieved worldwide success with the singles "Don't Cha", "Stickwitu", "Buttons", and their multi-platinum debut album PCD (2005). During that time, Wyatt was a contestant on the magic reality show Celebracadabra in 2007. Their second and final studio album Doll Domination (2008) contains hit singles "When I Grow Up", "I Hate This Part", and "Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)". Wyatt does the standing oversplit in most of group's music videos, which she called her trademark move. Despite their commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict due to the emphasis on Scherzinger and the subordinate treatment of the other members. In February 2010, for these reasons, Wyatt, Sutta, Roberts, and Thornton had announced their departures from The Pussycat Dolls and the group disbanded. In 2009, Wyatt played Siyotanka in the politically incorrect comedy series Poor Paul. From 2009 to 2014, she was a judge of the British dance competition show Got to Dance for five seasons.

Their debut studio album, 111, was released on July 11, 2011, preceding the singles "Stars in Your Eyes" and "Goodbye, Goodnight". The duo performed live for the next four years, until 2014. In 2011, she was a judge on the dance competition show Live to Dance, the American version of Got to Dance, along with Paula Abdul and Travis Payne. In 2014, Wyatt competeted in the winter sports talent show The Jump and in 2015 she won the final of the cooking reality show Celebrity MasterChef. From 2016 to 2018, she was judge of the British dance competition Taking The Next Step for three seasons.

On November 29, 2019, The Pussycat Dolls confirmed their comeback and, on February 7, 2020, they released a new single, "React", with a live performance on the finale of The X Factor: Celebrity. They announced a 36-date world tour, but plans were canceled due to the worsening situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the group ended the reunion in 2021.
