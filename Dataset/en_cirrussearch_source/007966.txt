Futbola klubs 1625 Liepāja, previously SFK Varavīksne (English: SFC Rainbow), was a football club based in Liepāja that last played in Latvian football's second tier, the First League. The club was founded on December 14, 1999 as SFK Varavīksne and until 2010 played in the Second League. Informally, the football team had existed since 1997. In 2010, Varavīksne won the Second League and were promoted to the First League. SFK Varavīksne was renamed FK 1625 Liepāja in February 2014. In 1625, Liepāja was awarded town rights. Due to financial difficulties and citing a lack of support from the municipality (which it disputed), the club was dissolved before the 2016 season. As late as 2021, a team of the same name (albeit with a different crest) played in regional mini football tournaments.
