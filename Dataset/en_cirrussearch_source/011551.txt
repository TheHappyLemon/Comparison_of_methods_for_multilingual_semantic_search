Fox Life was an international pay television network, launched by the Fox Networks Group in 2004. The network has been discontinued in several markets over time due to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney in 2019. The network's scheduling varied with each version, ranging from traditional entertainment programming, including television series, sitcoms and movies, among others, original programming in certain regions, and instructional and aspirational reality television on some other variations; in North America for instance, the network carried mainly Spanish language dubbed versions of American reality shows and instructional programming. Fox Life was first launched in Italy on May 13, 2004, in Portugal on May 19, 2005, and Bulgaria on September 8, 2005. For Latin America, it started in July 2006, when it was launched in Brazil. The channel also has versions in other countries around Europe. It launched in the Netherlands and Flanders on September 7, 2009. Fox Life launched in the United States on November 4, 2013. As of 22 November 2011, Fox had to change the programming for Fox Life in Flanders due to television rights issues in Belgium. From then on, a separate Flemish version was airing in Belgium. It used to air the Dutch version. The provider of satellite television in the Netherlands, Canal Digitaal, had to replace Fox Life with the Finnish version as well because it shared the Fox Life feed with the Belgium provider of satellite television, TV Vlaanderen Digitaal. On October 1, 2017, the Hong Kong and Southeast Asian version of Star World was rebranded to Fox Life. From 22 September 2015, Fox Life has been replaced by 24Kitchen for satellite viewers in the Netherlands. The Finnish Fox Life was rebranded as Fox. Fox Networks Group Benelux announced that Fox Life would officially close in the Netherlands on December 31, 2016. On 27 November 2020, Fox announced that they would be renaming the Fox branded channels in Latin America to Star Life on 22 February 2021. The networks closed on 31 March 2022, along with the American version. After 11 years in operations, the channel alongside other FOX/STAR channels are all shutting down on Hong Kong's Now TV on September 1, 2021, before announcing to closing down across Southeast Asia one month later in preparation of Disney+ (or Disney+ Hotstar in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand) rollouts across Southeast Asia. Notice of the discontinuation of the American iteration of Fox Life was sent to cable providers by Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution in late December 2021; the channel would be discontinued on March 31, 2022.
