On 22 August 1812 a Russian attack took place on the right wing of the Prussians at Dahlenkirchen and Olai, and at the same time on the left wing at Schlock and St.Annen. On the right wing, Colonel Horn was completely surprised, and after some resistance he had to retreat. Ultimately, the Prussians were able to stop the attacks, but they gave up Dahlenkirchen because they could not defend it. The unsuccessful siege of Riga went on.
