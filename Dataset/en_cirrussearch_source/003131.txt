Miroslav Kostadinov (Bulgarian: Мирослав Костадинов; born 10 March 1976) is a Bulgarian singer and songwriter who represented Bulgaria in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 with the song "Angel si ti". Kostadinov was born in Dobrich, Bulgaria. He began playing the piano as a child.[citation needed] Years later, he joined an amateur singing group. After receiving awards from a number of festivals,[citation needed] he collaborated with some friends who were well-known musicians. Kostadinov has won two awards in Varna Discovery,[citation needed] and has also performed in Turkey and Kazakhstan.[citation needed] Later, he became part of the pop duo KariZma. In 2007, he recorded his first two songs as a solo musician, entitled "Ever Before" and "Lose Control", the latter being the first single on his debut solo record Omirotvoren. For the Eurovision Song Contest in 2010, Bulgaria decided not to use the multi-heat selection system of previous years and select their artist internally. A panel of 51 music experts voted for a number of candidates; Kostadinov was the winner with ten votes, followed by Poli Genova with seven, and Nora in third place with three. Other artists in the running were Slavi Trifonov, Maria Ilieva, Lili Ivanova, Elitsa Todorova and Stoyan Yankoulov, the 2007 Bulgarian representatives. At a national final, Kostadinov performed five songs written especially for him, in five different music genres ranging from ethno to rock. The winning song, selected by televote, was "Angel si ti". It was performed in the second semi-final on 27 May 2010, but did not progress to the final. Рискувам да те имам (Riskuvam da te imam) Колко ми липсваш (Kolko mi lipsvash) Ще избягам ли от теб?
