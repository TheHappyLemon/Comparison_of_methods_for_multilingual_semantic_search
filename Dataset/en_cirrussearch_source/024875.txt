Kypuche (Ukrainian: Кипуче; Russian: Кипуче, romanized: Kipuche) or Artemivsk (Ukrainian: Артемівськ; Russian: Артёмовск, romanized: Artyomovsk) is a city in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine. Population: 7,162 (2022 estimate), 7,506 (2013 est.). It is situated in the historical and economic Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The city has been under the control of Russia and its proxy, the Luhansk People's Republic, since early 2014. The city was founded as Katerynivka (Ukrainian: Катеринівка) in 1910 or 1911, in connection with the construction of nearby coal mines. Coal mining began in 1913. During the times of the Soviet Union, it was renamed Artemivsk after the Bolshevik figure Comrade Artyom, and assigned to Perevalsk Raion. In 1938, Artemivsk received urban-type settlement status. During World War II, Artemivsk was occupied by Nazi Germany beginning on July 12, 1942. Nine residents of the town were tortured by the occupiers, and another 177 were deported for forced labor to Germany The Nazis "methodically destroyed" the town's infrastructure, burning down buildings and flooding mines. The town was eventually liberated on September 2, 1943 by the 315th Rifle Division of the Red Army, and was rebuilt. In 1964, Artemivsk received city status. Ukraine became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. The city has been under de-facto Russian control since the spring of 2014 as part of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).[citation needed] On May 12, 2016, Ukraine's national parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, restored the name of Kypuche as part of the country's decommunization process. In 2020, the Ukrainian government abolished Perevalsk Raion, and transferred Kypuche to the newly created Alchevsk Raion.[citation needed] In September 2022, Russia declared the annexation of Luhansk Oblast along with three other Ukrainian regions.[citation needed] In 2000, Artemivsk had a population of 10,500 people. It is a multiethnic city, with populations of Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusians, Tajiks, Armenians, Poles, and Jews, among other groups, living in it.
