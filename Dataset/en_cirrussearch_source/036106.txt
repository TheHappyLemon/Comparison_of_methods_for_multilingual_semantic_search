Thomas Luther's style is tactically oriented, which makes him a formidable opponent for even the strongest player. The following game is typical where he attacks former Candidate Robert Hübner right out of the opening. The game was played in the penultimate round of the German championship 2002 and laid the ground for Thomas' later winning the title. The comments are based on personal conversations with Thomas Luther himself. Robert Hübner (2640) – Thomas Luther (2538) (74th German Individual Championship, Saarbrücken, 2002, Round 8) 1. c2-c4 c7-c6 2. e2–e4 d7-d5 3. e4xd5 Ng8-f6 Black already offers a pawn sacrifice. Due to the gambit-style opening the position immediately becomes sharp and concrete. 4. Qd1-a4 After 4. d5xc6 Sb8xc6 black has a good game. 4. … e7-e6 Either way, Black absolutely wants to sacrifice a pawn. 5. d5xe6 Bf8-c5 6. Ng1-f3 White didn't want to take the risk of accepting the second sacrifice. After 6. e6xf7+ Ke8xf7 the rook h8 dangerously comes into play too. 6. … Nf6-g4 Again Black continues as aggressively as possible. 7. d2-d4 Bc5xd4 8. Nf3xd4 Qd8xd4 9. Qa4-c2 Nb8-a6 The second knight joins the attack. Blacks opening strategy was successful. 10. Nb1-a3 Bc8xe6 11. h2-h3 Na6-b4 12. Qc2-d2 Qd4-e4+ 13. Bf1-e2 Qe4xg2 14. Rh1-f1 Ng4-h2 (!) Black starts a combination leading to material gain. The inconspicuous knight on h2 will single-handedly wreak havoc in Whites position. 15. Qd2xb4 0-0-0 16. Na3-b5 A good try to molest the black king with a knight sacrifice. Black, though, has a spectacular counterpunch: 16. … c6xb5 17. Bc1-f4 The threat is Qc5+, forcing Qc6 and the subsequent loss of a knight as Black would get mated otherwise. 17. … Qg2xf1+ !! This queen sacrifice starts the very effective deployment of the knight. Black wins material. 18. Be2xf1 Nh2-f3+ 19. Ke1-e2 Nf3-d4+ 20. Ke2-d2 Asquiesces the discovered check but other king moves were even worse: Ke2-e1/e3 and Nd4-c2+ wins the queen. 20. … Nd4-c6+ 21. Qb4-d6 Rd8xd6+ 22. Bf4xd6 Be6xc4 Black reaps the fruit of his combinatorial fireworks: the smoke has cleared and he is two pawns ahead. 23. Kd2-c3 Rh8-d8 24. Bd6-f4 Bc4xf1 25. Ra1xf1 b5-b4+ 26. Kc3-c2 Rd8-d5 27. Bf4-e3 Kc8-d7 28. Rf1-g1 g7-g6 29. Rg1-g4 a7-a5 30. Rg4-h4 h7-h5 31. Rh4-f4 f7-f5 32. h3-h4 b7-b5 33. Rf4-f3 Nc6-d4+ 34. Be3xd4 Rd5xd4 35. Rf3-d3 Rd4xd3 36. Kc2xd3 g6-g5 This pawn breakthrough decides the game. The rest for completeness' sake: 37. h4xg5 h5-h4 38. Kd3-e2 f5-f4 39. f2-f3 Kd6-e6 40. Ke2-f2 Ke6-f5 41. Kf2-g2 Kf5xg5 42. Kg2-h3 Kg5-h5 43. Kh3-g2 Kh5-g6 44. Kg2-h2 Kg6-f6 45. Kh2-h3 Kf6-e5 46. Kh3xh4 Ke5-d4 White gave up! Luther has a congenital disability (dysmelia) on his arms.
