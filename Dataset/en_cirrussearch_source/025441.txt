Krompachy (German: Krombach, Hungarian: Korompa) is a town in Slovakia, with a rich mining and metallurgical history, well-known both in Slovakia and in its close neighboring countries for its Plejsy ski center. The town was first mentioned in 1282 in a charter by King Ladislaus IV as belonging to the domain of Spiš Castle. The town's name derives from German (Krumm Bach - crooked stream), as the town was settled by German colonists. From then onwards, it was a centre of mining and metallurgy until the end of the 20th century, particularly focussed on the iron and copper industries. At the start of the 20th century, the Krompachy Ironworks (Krompašská železiareň) had around 3,500 employees and was the biggest ironworks of its time in the Kingdom of Hungary. The Ironworks closed after World War I. In 1921, there was a bloody uprising, known as the Krompachy Uprising (Slovak: Krompašská vzbura) in the town. Since 1991, following the industrial decline and as a result of large-scale investment, Plejsy became an internationally visited alpine ski centre and became known as a holiday destination. As well as the skiing centre at Plejsy, Krompachy is known for its scenery of hills, valleys and fields. This, together with a number of local natural and cultural sites, has made the town a year-round tourist destination.
