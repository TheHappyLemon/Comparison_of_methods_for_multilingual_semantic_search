The 2023 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships was the 47th edition of the Ice Hockey World Junior Championship, held between December 26, 2022 and January 5, 2023. It was won by Canada, in overtime of the gold-medal game. Czechia won the silver, their first medal since 2005. The venue was originally scheduled to be Novosibirsk and Omsk, Russia, but Russia's hosting rights were pulled in February 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The replacement hosts were Halifax, Nova Scotia and Moncton, New Brunswick, both in Canada. It was the 18th time Canada has hosted the tournament, and the third consecutively. The relegation round was revived, after a two-year hiatus due to the 2021 Division I, II, and III tournaments having been cancelled, and in 2022, both Russia and Belarus were automatically expelled from the competition. On May 23, 2018, the IIHF announced Novosibirsk, Russia, as host city. Novosibirsk was to host Group A matches, while the city of Omsk was to host Group B matches. In February 2022, in condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) called for Russia to be stripped of hosting rights to all international sporting events. Russia's hosting of the 2023 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships was scheduled to be discussed in a meeting of the IIHF council on February 28, 2022. The IIHF suspended Russia and Belarus from international ice hockey until further notice, and stripped Russia of its hosting rights for the World Junior Championships. In late-March 2022, Sportsnet journalist Jeff Marek reported that the IIHF had considered Canada as a possible host country for the tournament, which would make it the third consecutive World Junior Championship to be hosted in the country (the previous two tournaments have been hosted in Alberta with Edmonton as the main host city, but were held in a "bubble" behind closed doors and postponed to August 2022 respectively due to the COVID-19 pandemic). On May 5, the IIHF and Hockey Canada announced that Halifax and Moncton would be the hosts of the tournament, beating out announced bids by Regina/Saskatoon, Ottawa/Quebec City, and London/Waterloo. It marks the 20th anniversary of Halifax's previous hosting of the tournament in 2003.
