Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. The Plurinational State of Bolivia accepted the convention on 4 October 1976, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. Bolivia has seven sites on the list and a further five on the tentative list. The first site listed in Bolivia was the city of Potosí, in 1987. Noel Kempff Mercado National Park is a natural site, other six sites are listed for their cultural properties. One site is transnational: the Qhapaq Ñan, Andean Road System is shared with five other countries. UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.   * Transnational site In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Bolivia has five properties on its tentative list. "The World Heritage Convention".
