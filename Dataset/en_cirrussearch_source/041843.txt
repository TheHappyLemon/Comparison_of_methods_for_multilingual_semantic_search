Christina Weirather (born 24 May 1989) is a retired Liechtensteiner World Cup alpine ski racer. She won a bronze medal in Super-G for Liechtenstein at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Weirather made her World Cup debut at age 16 in October 2005 and had nine victories and 41 podiums through her retirement in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Weirather competed in two events at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and finished 33rd in the super-G, but did not finish in the downhill. She had qualified to ski in four events at the 2010 Winter Olympics: downhill, super-G, giant slalom, and the combined. Just weeks before the Olympics on 23 January, while competing in a World Cup downhill at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Weirather suffered another anterior cruciate ligament injury to her right knee and missed the Olympics, as well as the following World Cup season of 2011. Following years of training alongside her compatriots on the Liechtenstein Alpine Ski team, Weirather switched to training with the Swiss team. During the fourth training run for the downhill at the 2014 Winter Olympics, Weirather crashed at Rosa Khutor on 9 February and injured her lower right leg. The bone contusion caused her to miss her starts in the Olympics and the remainder of the 2014 World Cup season. At the time, she was second in the World Cup overall, downhill and super-G standings and third in the giant slalom. On 25 March 2020 she announced her retirement. Born in Vaduz, Weirather is the daughter of former World Cup ski racers Harti Weirather of Austria and Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein (and the niece of Andreas Wenzel). Her mother Hanni won two overall World Cup titles (1978, 1980) and two Olympic gold medals (1980), four Olympic medals overall; uncle Andreas won the men's overall World Cup title in 1980 and 2 Olympic medals. Her father Harti won the season title in downhill in 1981 and was world champion in 1982. Weirather married Swiss radio host Fabio Nay in September 2022. The couple have a son, Lio, born in January 2024. 9 wins (1 DH, 7 SG, 1 GS) 41 podiums (14 DH, 21 SG, 6 GS) ^ injured during downhill training run 2009 Alpine skiing Junior World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Germany) Giant slalom 2007 Alpine skiing Junior World Championships in Altenmarkt (Austria) Downhill Super-G Giant slalom 2006 Alpine skiing Junior World Championships in Mont Sainte-Anne (Canada) Giant slalom 2005 Swiss Alpine Skiing Championships in Veysonnaz (Switzerland) Giant slalom 2006 Swiss Alpine Skiing Championships in St. Moritz (Switzerland) Giant slalom 2009 Swiss Alpine Skiing Championships in St. Moritz (Switzerland) Giant slalom 2009 German Alpine Skiing Championships in Oberjoch (Germany) Giant slalom 2006 Liechtenstein Alpine Skiing Championships in Malbun (Liechtenstein) Giant slalom List of FIS Alpine Ski World Cup women's race winners List of Olympic medalist families Dunbar, Graham (23 December 2013).
