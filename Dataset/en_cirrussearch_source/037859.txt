European route E 67 is an E-road running from Prague in the Czech Republic to Estonia and by ferry to Finland. It goes via Prague, Wrocław, Warsaw, Kaunas, Panevėžys, Riga, Tallinn, Helsinki. The route is known as the Via Baltica between Warsaw and Tallinn, a distance of 970 kilometres (600 mi). It is a significant road connection between the Baltic states and Poland. The route is mostly ordinary road, but there are plans to convert it into a motorway or expressway, in Poland called S8 (326 of 379 km completed as of 2015[update]) and S61 (178,6 of 235 km completed as of December 2022[update]). Along the Via Baltica highway, the stretch of European route E67 between Warsaw and Tallinn, a 5G mobile network will be built in order to facilitate self-driving vehicles and expand opportunities for freight carriers. The Via Baltica attracted great controversy in 2007, as its planned new express road was to take it through several areas in Poland of great natural value. Most controversial was the Augustów bypass, which would take the route through the wetlands of the Rospuda Valley, the last area of its kind remaining in Europe,[citation needed] and an area protected by EU law as part of the European Natura 2000 Network. In July 2007 Polish Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński halted work on the bypass after the European Commission applied for an immediate injunction. After an intense campaign of protests in Poland and abroad and also counter-protests of the local community, the plans have been changed, and now the highway has been rerouted to completely avoid the wilderness area.  Finland Helsinki : Helsinki – Tallinn  Estonia T4: Tallinn – Laagri – Märjamaa – Pärnu-Jaagupi – Pärnu – Häädemeeste – Ikla – / border crossing  Latvia A 1: / border crossing – Ainaži – Salacgrīva – Saulkrasti – Ādaži – Riga A 4: Riga A 6: Riga A 5: Riga A 7: Riga – Iecava – Bauska – Grenctāle – / border crossing  Lithuania A 10: / border crossing – Pasvalys – Panevėžys A 17: Panevėžys A 8: Panevėžys – Kėdainiai – Juodoniai A 1: Juodoniai (Start of Concurrency with E85) – Kaunas (End of Concurrency with E85) A 5: Kaunas – Marijampolė – / border crossing  Poland S 61: / border crossing – Suwałki – Dowspuda DK 8: Dowspuda – Augustów – Białystok S 8: Białystok – Zambrów – Ostrów Mazowiecka – Wyszków – Warsaw (Short concurrency with E30 and E77) – Paszków – Nadarzyn – Radziejowice – Mszczonow – Rawa Mazowiecka – Tomaszów Mazowiecki – Piotrków Trybunalski A 1: Piotrków Trybunalski (Start of Concurrency with E75) – Rokszyce – Łódź S 8: Łódź (End of Concurrency with E75) – Łask – Zduńska Wola – Sieradz – Kepno – Olesnica – Wrocław – Domasław DK 8: Domasław – Kobierzyce – Jordanów Śląski – Łagiewniki – Ząbkowice Śląskie – Klodzko – Kudowa-Zdrój – / border crossing  Czech Republic I/33: / border crossing – Náchod – Česká Skalice – Jaroměř – Smiřice – Hradec Králové I/11: Hradec Králové D 11: Hradec Králové – Chlumec nad Cidlinou – Poděbrady – Prague Rail Baltica Estonian national road 4 A1 road (Latvia) A4 road (Latvia) A6 road (Latvia) A5 road (Latvia) A7 road (Latvia) A5 highway (Lithuania) Expressway S61 (Poland) Expressway S8 (Poland) D11 motorway (Czech Republic) Suwałki Gap, which the route crosses Baltic ministers sign Via Baltica 5G agreement Eesti Rahvusringhääling 29.09.2018 Easton, Adam (2007-07-31).
