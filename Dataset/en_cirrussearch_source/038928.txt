She has a career-high singles ranking of world No. 26, achieved on 22 October 2018. She is the current Italian No. 3. After winning her first ITF title in 2009, Giorgi made her Grand Slam main-draw debut at the 2011 Wimbledon Championships. Giorgi reached the fourth round of the 2012 Wimbledon Championships in just her second appearance at the tournament. After her successful run at the championships, she made her top-100 debut in the WTA rankings. The following year, she followed it up with a third-round run at the Wimbledon Championships, and made her second Grand Slam fourth round at the US Open. She reached her first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships, six years after her Wimbledon breakout. Giorgi reached her first WTA Tour final in 2014 at the Katowice Open, and then won her first title at the Rosmalen Open. She won the biggest title of her career at the 2021 National Bank Open in Montreal, defeating former world No. 1, Karolína Plíšková, in the final. Giorgi is known for her aggressive style of game and her powerful flat groundstrokes, and is considered to be one of the hardest hitters of the ball on the tour. Her most notable professional wins have come at the 2013 US Open, Indian Wells Open, and Eastbourne International, defeating former world No. 1 players Caroline Wozniacki, Maria Sharapova, and Victoria Azarenka, respectively. Giorgi was born in Macerata, Italy, to Jewish parents Claudia Gabriella Fullone and Sergio Giorgi, an Argentine of Italian descent who emigrated to Italy from La Plata. Her father was drafted in Argentina in 1982 and fought in the Falklands War against the British, while her mother is a fashion designer. Now, her father coaches her full-time while her mother designs her dresses for tennis matches. She is Jewish and considered emigrating to Israel in 2012, after her father opened negotiations with the Israel Tennis Association (ITA) over the financial terms for her immigration to Israel. As of September 2013, the Giorgi family was based in the Italian city of Pisa. Giorgi is quadrilingual, speaking Spanish, Italian, French, and English. There are four children in Giorgi's family. In addition to her older brother Leandro, who is studying to become an actor, her younger brother Amadeus is a former professional footballer, who played as a forward for lower league clubs in Italy, Spain and Portugal. She had a sister named Antonela who died in a car accident in Paris. Following an initial interest in artistic gymnastics, Giorgi decided to devote herself to tennis after assisting in her brother's training, when she was five years old. She was subjected to hard training by her father, Sergio. Two years later, 1976 French Open champion Adriano Panatta said of her: "It's the first time I play a girl who plays like Andre Agassi." In 2000, she was spotted by tennis coach Nick Bollettieri, who subsequently offered her seven months of training (previously offered only to Maria Sharapova). In November 2005, she reached the final of the Nike Junior Tour, but was defeated by Zuzana Luknárová from Slovakia.

Giorgi exited Wimbledon in the first round, losing to Varvara Gracheva in straight sets. Giorgi is a baseline player, who has a highly aggressive playing style. She likes to take the ball early on the rise, and possesses powerful, flat groundstrokes. Her strongest groundstroke is her two-handed backhand, with which she can hit winners from any position on the court. She hits the ball with relentless power, and is known to be one of the hardest hitters on the tour. She frequently utilizes aggressive serve-forehand combinations to finish points quickly. Giorgi aims to generate extreme angles with both her forehand and backhand, to surprise baseline opponents and hit winners with ease. She is known for her tendency to aim for the lines, which means that she accumulates significant numbers of both winners and unforced errors in any match. Unlike the rest of her game, her serve is known for its inconsistency: she has a tendency to take risks on her second serve, leading to a relatively high double fault count. In 2015, Giorgi served the most double faults recorded in WTA history, at 458. She regularly hits deep returns, and takes the ball early while receiving, allowing her to hit a significant number of return winners. In an article for LiveTennis.com, Nicholas Walz commented on Giorgi's game, saying: "Her play is often too erratic – she followed her result in Indian Wells [defeating No. 4 seed, Maria Sharapova] by losing in the Miami Open qualifying [two weeks later] to Zarina Diyas." Her preferred surfaces are fast hard and grass courts. Giorgi wears custom-made clothes, designed by her mother (brand: Giomila). Up to 2021, Giorgi used Babolat racquets, specifically using the Pure Storm model, and later the Pure Strike model. In 2021, Giorgi switched companies and began to use the Yonex VCORE 100.
