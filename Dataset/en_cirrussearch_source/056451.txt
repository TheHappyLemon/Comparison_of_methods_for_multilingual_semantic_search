Reginald Shon Jackson (born April 16, 1990), nicknamed Big Government, is an American professional basketball player for the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played three seasons for the Boston College Eagles before declaring for the 2011 NBA draft, where he was drafted 24th overall by the Oklahoma City Thunder. Jackson also played for the Detroit Pistons and Los Angeles Clippers before joining the Nuggets, where he won a championship with the team in 2023. Jackson was born in Pordenone, in northeast Italy, to American parents. Jackson's father served at Aviano Air Base. The Jacksons later moved to England before going to the United States when Jackson was five. The family lived in North Dakota for a year before moving to Georgia and Florida before settling in Colorado Springs, Colorado when Jackson was in sixth grade. He graduated from General William J. Palmer High School in Colorado Springs in 2008, and won the 2007–08 Gatorade Colorado Boys' Basketball Player of the Year. In April 2008, Jackson officially declared as an American citizen and relinquished his Italian citizenship. Considered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Jackson was listed as the No. 29 shooting guard and the No. 115 player in the nation in 2008. Jackson arrived at Boston College and joined a team that was already armed with stars such as Tyrese Rice and Rakim Sanders. In Jackson's freshman season, the Eagles made the NCAA tournament with Jackson being used as an explosive weapon off the bench. In his second season, Jackson stepped into a starting role following the departure of Rice, but the Eagles were unable to make it back to the NCAA Tournament. As a junior in 2010–11, he led the Eagles in scoring with 18.2 points per game and led them to the National Invitation Tournament. He subsequently earned first-team All-ACC honors alongside Nolan Smith, Jordan Williams, Malcolm Delaney and Kyle Singler. After his junior season, Jackson declared for the NBA draft. Jackson saw limited action in his first season with the Oklahoma City Thunder, averaging just 11.1 minutes over 45 games playing behind Russell Westbrook and Eric Maynor. He scored over three points per game but shot only 32% from the field, and that percentage dropped to 21% when Jackson took shots beyond the arc. He did not play in any of the Thunder's 20 playoff games in 2012 as the Thunder lost to the Miami Heat 4 games to 1 in the NBA Finals. Jackson was assigned multiple times to the Tulsa 66ers of the NBA Development League between March and December 2012. As a sophomore during the 2012–13 season, Jackson's minutes and production steadily increased. In game 2 of the Thunder's first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets, starting point guard Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus and was ruled out for the rest of the season, as Jackson was promoted to a starting role. In his first career start, he had 14 points, 2 rebounds and 1 assist, helping the Thunder win game 3. As a starter during the playoffs, Jackson averaged 15.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game. On February 6, 2014, Jackson was chosen to compete in the 2014 Taco Bell Skills Challenge. On April 26, 2014, he recorded a career-high 32 points along with 9 rebounds against the Memphis Grizzlies in game 4 of the 2014 first-round playoff series, which the Thunder won 92–89. Jackson had 5 points in the final minute of regulation to force overtime, but heaved a shot from full court, still with 4 seconds left. In overtime, Jackson hit four free throws to ensure a Thunder victory. He was praised for his performance as the Thunder's star players Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook had off shooting nights. On November 11, 2014, Jackson scored a season-high 29 points on 12-of-21 shooting in the 78–85 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. On February 19, 2015, Jackson was traded to the Detroit Pistons as part of a three-team deal that also involved the Utah Jazz.

Jackson finished the game with 26 points, 11 rebounds and ten assists in a 111–97 win over the Orlando Magic. Jackson became the first Pistons guard to record multiple triple-doubles in a season since Isiah Thomas during the 1986–87 season, and the first Pistons player to do so since Grant Hill during the 1997–98 season. On July 20, 2015, the Pistons re-signed Jackson to a five-year, $80 million contract. On November 8, 2015, he recorded a career-high 40 points in a 120–103 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.

Jackson was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the week ending December 20, 2015. He joined Andre Drummond as the only Pistons teammates to win the award twice in the same season. Jackson averaged 29.3 points (first in the Eastern Conference), 7.7 assists (second in the Eastern Conference) and 6.3 rebounds while helping lead the Pistons to a 2–1 record for the week against three teams with above .500 records. He shot 46% from the field, 38% from behind the arc and 83% from the free-throw line.
