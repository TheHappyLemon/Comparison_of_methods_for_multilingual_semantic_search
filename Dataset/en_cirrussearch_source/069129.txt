JAC Group (Chinese: 江汽集团; officially Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp., Ltd.) is a Chinese automobile and commercial vehicle manufacturer. The company is based in Hefei, Anhui Province, China. The company produced about 524,000 units in 2021, including 271,800 commercial vehicles and 252,500 passenger vehicles. It also sold 16,800 BEVs in December 2021. It is considered a relatively small carmaker, ranking outside of the top 10 Chinese automakers in terms of cars sold. Established in 1964 as Hefei Jianghuai Automobile Factory, its name was changed to Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co., Ltd. in 1997. The company made an IPO on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2001. JAC has historically only produced commercial trucks under the brand name Jianghu(undei), but MPVs and SUVs appeared in the 2000s. By 2007, the company had gained government approval for passenger car production but, nonetheless, continued to be referred to as a truck maker. Prior to the 2007 acquisition of a passenger car license, JAC cooperated with Hyundai Motor Company in the early 2000s in an attempt to expand its product line.[citation needed] Beginning in 2003, it assembled Hyundai MPVs although this stopped sometime prior to 2007. At least two models based on Hyundai technology continued to be made by JAC after the cooperation was cancelled–a MPVand a SUV."JAC Eagle SUV gains Audi style grill for 2011 JAC MOTORS". chinacartimes.com. January 27, 2011. Retrieved July 14, 2012.</ref> Hyundai explored setting up a joint venture with the company in 2004. In 2009, the Chinese government indicated that it supported consolidation in the Chinese auto industry, leading analysts to predict the possibility of JAC joining with Chery since they are both located in Anhui province. On the surface such a merger would make sense: Chery mainly built passenger cars, and JAC was almost entirely focused on trucks at the time. Since then, however, JAC has made it clear that it is not interested in consolidation under the aegis of the larger Chery. JAC has begun to concentrate more on passenger cars, and a 2010 announcement of a new electric vehicle program may—at least partially—have been an effort to stave off the rumored merger. Sales reached more than 445,000 units in 2012. In 2013 it was one of the top ten most-productive vehicle manufacturers in China selling 458,500 units for 2.5% market share and reaching eighth place. JAC dropped one spot to ninth in 2011 making nearly 500,000 vehicles, and in 2012 a fall in units produced to about 445,000 precipitated the company's moving down one more rung to tenth place. Estimated production capacity is over 500,000 units/year as of 2009. In 2014, JAC Motors announced its full acquisition of JAC Group, the new company would be trade as JAC Motors in the stock market but operated in the name of JAC Group. In 2016 JAC entered into an agreement with DR Automobiles to export its vehicles to Italy. JAC models made in China will be re-approved according to European safety and anti-pollution regulations by DR and sold with the DR badge. The first cars imported into Italy are the JAC Refine S3 renamed DR4 (or EVO 4) and the JAC iEV40 sold as the DR Evo Electric (or EVO 3 Electric). In 2017 JAC and Volkswagen Group announced a joint venture to produce electric cars for the Chinese market with the SEAT brand, in April 2018 the JAC-Volkswagen joint venture was officially born, which however operates through the new Sol brand, and no longer SEAT. The first product is the SOL E20X vehicle, an electric crossover resulting from a badge engineering of the JAC iEV40 (also called JAC Refine S2 EV) with a front redesigned by the SEAT style center in Spain. In 2020, Volkswagen Group signs letters of intent between Volkswagen (China) Investment Co. Ltd. and the Government of Anhui Province, for the increase of the Volkswagen Group's stake in the JAC Volkswagen joint venture, from the current 50% to 75%. A transition that also requires investment in JAG (JAC Holding Group), the parent company of JAC and owned by the Anhui Government. The agreement between the parties, subject to the usual regulatory approvals, provides for the investment of an amount equal to one billion euros and should be concluded by the end of the year. Volkswagen would also acquire 50% of JAG (the parent company of JAC). Volkswagen Group holds a 75% share of Volkswagen Anhui while JAC Group holds a 25% share. Volkswagen Group also owned 50% of JAC Holding Group (JAG), the parent company of JAC Group, which means Volkswagen Group also owns a 14.09% stake of JAC Group. As a result, the ownership percentage held by Volkswagen Group in Volkswagen Anhui actually reaches 78.52%. In April 2016, NIO and JAC Group signed a manufacturing cooperation agreement, preliminarily confirming a production and sales target of 50,000 vehicles per year for a duration of 5 years. In 2018, NIO's first mass-produced model, the NIO ES8, manufactured by JAC, was officially launched. In March 2021, NIO and JAC Group established Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing Technology (Anhui) Co., Ltd., with each party holding a 50% stake in the joint venture. In the same month, both company agree to extend the contract of manufacturing to May 2024. As part of the agreement renewal, NIO paid JAC CNY 1.2 billion for the extension of contract manufacturing services. In December 2023, NIO has announced the acquisition of JAC factories manufacturing NIO vehicles at the price of CNY 3.158 billion, which marks the end of OEM for NIO. Since the commencement of OEM partnership, NIO has paid JAC the amount of CNY 223 million, CNY 441 million, CNY 532 million, CNY 715 million, and CNY 1.127 billion in the years 2018 to 2022 respectively. Over the five-year period, the total amount paid for contract manufacturing services reached a substantial sum of CNY 3.038 billion. On January 11, 2024, JAC has signed strategic cooperation framework agreements with Nio to establish cooperation in battery standards, battery swapping technology, the construction of battery swapping service networks, and operation. In December 2023, JAC announced that it has signed a cooperation agreement with Huawei. The two parties will collaborate in manufacturing, sales, and services to develop premium EV based on Huawei's intelligent automotive solutions. JAC as the main brand, has gone through multiple transition during last decades. Originally, JAC has several products line. The Heyue for sedans, hatchbacks, MPVs, and SUVs, the Refine for large MPVs/minivans and vans. In 2017, the Heyue series was discontinued and the final models were replaced by electric variants. In 2019, a new series, Jiayue, was introduced. Multiple Refine vehicles have been facelifted and moved to this series. In 2020, JAC started to rebadge JAC Jiayue series models to Sehol brand, resulted in the Sehol A5, Sehol X4, Sehol X7. The rebadge is in fact a move to move all sedans and SUV under the Sehol brand. In 2023, JAC revealed that they decided to phase out the Sehol brand in the future, several Sehol models, like QX, A5 and X8, were rebadged back to JAC brand. JAC A5 Plus (2023–present), compact sedan, rebadged Sehol A5 Plus JAC QX PHEV (2023–present), compact SUV, rebadged Sehol QX JAC X8 Plus (2023–present), mid-size SUV, rebadged Sehol X8 JAC iEVA50 (2018–present), EV variant of Heyue JAC iEV7 (2014–present), EV variant of Heyue A20 JAC A5 Plus JAC QX PHEV JAC X8 Plus JAC iEVA50 JAC iEV7 Sehol (思皓) was established in 2018 as a joint venture between JAC and Volkswagen, originally positioned as a brand for pure electric vehicles. In 2020, the Volkswagen Group increased its stake in the joint venture, JAC Volkswagen, to 75% and officially renamed Volkswagen Anhui. The Sehol brand has been licensed for use by JAC, essentially making it no longer a joint venture brand. In 2023, JAC revealed that they decided to phase out the Sehol brand in the future. Sehol E10X Sehol E20X Sehol X4 Sehol X7 Sehol X8 Sehol A5 Plus Sehol QX JAC Yiwei (江淮钇为) is JAC's brand for entry-level passenger EV, launched in April 2023.

An R&D facility in Hefei, capital of the Anhui province, is complemented by three overseas R&D centres in Turin, Tokyo and Seoul. JAC announced a pair of joint ventures with Navistar International Corporation , NC2 Global (itself a Navistar/Caterpillar joint venture). The NC2 joint venture will manufacture heavy duty trucks. The Navistar joint venture, called JAC-Navistar Diesel Engine Company (JND), will build medium to heavy diesel engines in China with parts and services provisioned by Navistar. The new companies will both be located in Hefei where JAC is also based. Cummins purchased Navistar's equity in the engine joint venture in 2018. Sehol (Chinese: 思皓; Sihao) is a car brand launched on April 24, 2018, by SEAT and JAC Volkswagen Automotive Co., Ltd. joint venture. JAC began the export of vehicles to Bolivia in 1990, later expanding to over one hundred countries. Light trucks are a popular export product. Some JAC exports are in the form of knock-down kits, which are assembled at overseas factories in countries including Egypt, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Mexico and Iran. As of 2010, a possible factory in Slovakia is under discussion. Such factories are not necessarily owned by or affiliated with JAC. Knock-down exports are an easy way to gain access to developing markets without added after-sales service costs. In 2009, JAC started a partnership with a distributor in Brazil, the SHC group. As of early 2011, it had more than 10,000 firm orders from its Brazilian partner. JAC also had plans to build a production base in the country as of 2009. This plan remained active until at least 2011, at which time the plant was to be located in Bahia state and built in cooperation with the SHC group, which was to provide 80% of the initial investment. In 2016, JAC entered the Philippines market through a local partner, selling heavy-duty trucks, and in 2018, passenger cars.[better source needed] In 2017, JAC announced a joint venture in Mexico with Giant Motors (company owned by tycoon Carlos Slim). A factory has been built at Ciudad Sahagún, in the State of Hidalgo. With a surface of 65,000 square meters, has two lines of production with a capacity of over 25,000 units per year. Since early June 2017, two models are sold in Mexican market: SEI2 and SEI3, both SUVs are made in Mexico in this facility, the compact sedan J4 was added to the line-up in 2018.
