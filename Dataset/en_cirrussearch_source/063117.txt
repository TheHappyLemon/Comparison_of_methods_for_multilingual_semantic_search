The 2022–23 Serie A (known as the Serie A TIM for sponsorship reasons) was the 121st season of top-tier Italian football, the 91st in a round-robin tournament, and the 13th since its organization under an own league committee, the Lega Serie A. AC Milan were the defending champions. On 4 May 2023, Napoli secured their third Serie A title and the first since 1990 with five matches to spare, following a 1–1 draw away to Udinese. Starting from the 2022–23 season, should the first and second, or 17th and 18th-placed teams at the end of the season be tied on points, a play-off tiebreaker match would be held at a neutral site to determine the title and final team relegated respectively. The tiebreaker would not have extra time, and would instead directly go to a penalty shoot-out should the two teams be tied after 90 minutes. This was the first time play-offs were used since the 2004–05 campaign. Lega Serie A had initially planned to run a tournament featuring Serie A teams in the United States during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but this was later cancelled. In January 2023, Juventus were deducted 15 points as punishment for capital gain violations. In April 2023, the decision was overturned and Juventus were given those points back. However, following a new investigation, Juventus were docked 10 points in May 2023. On 28 July 2023, UEFA released a statement confirming Juventus' violation of the financial regulations. Consequently, Juventus faced penalties including exclusion from the 2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League. Cagliari were relegated from the 2021–22 Serie A after six years in the top flight, Genoa were relegated to the second level after fifteen years, and Venezia were relegated after just one season in the top flight. They were replaced by 2021–22 Serie B champions Lecce, runners-up Cremonese, and play-off winners Monza. Lecce returned to the top flight after two years of absence, whilst Cremonese returned for the first time in 26 years. Monza, meanwhile, were promoted to Serie A for the first time in the club's history. They became the 67th team to play in the top flight of Italian football.

(Note: Head-to-head record is used only after all the matches between the teams in question have been played) (C) Champions; (O) Play-off winners; (R) Relegated Notes: Should the first and second, or 17th and 18th-placed teams at the end of the season be tied on points, a play-off tiebreaker match was held at a neutral site to determine the title and final team relegated respectively. Since the winners of the 2022–23 Coppa Italia, Inter Milan, qualified for the Champions League, the Europa League berth awarded to the Coppa Italia winners was passed to the sixth-placed team, and the Europa Conference League berth awarded to the sixth-placed team was passed to the seventh-placed team. Juventus were excluded from UEFA competitions due to violation of UEFA's financial regulations. Juventus were deducted 10 points as punishment for capital gain violations. The table lists the positions of teams after each week of matches. In order to preserve chronological evolvements, any postponed matches are not included to the round at which they were originally scheduled, but added to the full round that was played immediately afterwards.
