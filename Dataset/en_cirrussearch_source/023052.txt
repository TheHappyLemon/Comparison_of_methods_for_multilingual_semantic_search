Cádiz is a province of southern Spain, in the southwestern part of the autonomous community of Andalusia. It is the southernmost part of mainland Spain, as well as the southernmost part of continental Europe. It is bordered by the Spanish provinces of Huelva, Seville, and Málaga, as well as the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Strait of Gibraltar and the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. Its area is 7,385 square kilometres (2,851 sq mi). Its capital is the city of Cádiz, which has a population of 114,244. As of 2021, the largest city is Jerez de la Frontera with 212,801 inhabitants. Algeciras, which surpassed Cádiz with 122,982 inhabitants, is the second most populated city. The entire province had a population of 1,245,960 (as of 2021), of whom about 600,000 live in the Bay of Cádiz area (including Jerez), making it the third most populous province in Andalusia. Its population density is 167.93 per square kilometre. The province encompasses 44 municipalities; besides its capital, other important cities are Jerez and Algeciras. (See the list of municipalities in Cádiz.) According to a roster developed by the Council of Tourism and Sport of Andalusia on 27 March 2003, there are officially six traditional or touristic comarcas (provincial areas or counties) in the Province of Cádiz: Bahía de Cádiz (Bay of Cádiz) Campiña de Jerez (Countryside of Jerez) Campo de Gibraltar (Countryside of Gibraltar) Bajo Guadalquivir (Lower Guadalquivir, or Northwest Coast, Costa Noroeste) La Janda Sierra de Cádiz (Cádiz Mountains) This area comprises towns and cities on the shores of the Bay of Cádiz on the west-central coast of the province: Cádiz Chiclana El Puerto de Santa María Puerto Real San Fernando Panteón de Marinos Ilustres The bullring at El Puerto The cathedral at Cádiz Sancti Petri beach This fertile area only includes two municipalities, both large in area: Jerez de la Frontera San José del Valle Octagonal tower in the Alcázar of Jerez de la Frontera A sherry solera Cathedral of Jerez de la Frontera Horse Riding at Fair of Jerez de la Frontera The towns that extend into the rural hinterlands north of Gibraltar are: Algeciras Jimena de la Frontera Castellar de la Frontera San Roque La Línea de la Concepción Los Barrios Tarifa View of La Línea from the Rock of Gibraltar High plaza at Algeciras Chapel of Our Lady of Europe Hozgarganta river The towns of this area called the "Bajo Guadalquivir" (lower Guadalquivir valley), are: Chipiona Rota Sanlúcar de Barrameda Trebujena The castle of Santiago in Sanlúcar de Barrameda Salt mine at Sanlúcar Las Covachas La Cárcel (now a conservatory) Towns included in La Janda, an area in the southwestern part of the province, are: Alcalá de los Gazules Barbate Benalup-Casas Viejas Conil de la Frontera Medina Sidonia Paterna de Rivera Vejer de la Frontera Casa Consistorial, Medina Sidonia La Breña Vejer de la Frontera Beaches Towns included in the Cádiz Mountains area, in the northeastern part of the province, include: Alcalá del Valle Algar Algodonales Arcos de la Frontera Benaocaz Bornos El Bosque El Gastor Espera Grazalema Olvera Prado del Rey Puerto Serrano Setenil de las Bodegas Torre Alháquime Ubrique Villaluenga del Rosario Villamartín Zahara de la Sierra Setenil Zahara de la Sierra Griffon vultures are common in Alcalá del Valle Grazalema from Endrinal mountains The historical population is given in the following chart: The entire province of Cádiz has a Mediterranean climate, mostly Köppen Csa but also Csb in high altitude areas. Large differences in summer temperatures exist between the three official stations in Cádiz, Jerez, and Tarifa depending on position relative to the coastline. Tarifa is exceptionally mild for such a southerly place in Spain, meanwhile winter temperatures are mild throughout the province with less difference between localities than in summer. Average yearly rainfall is 521 mm (20.5 in) in Cádiz, 573 mm (22.6 in) in Jerez, and 603 mm (23.7 in) in Tarifa. This is comparable to much cloudier climates further north in Europe, in spite of the high number of sunshine hours in the province. The Cádiz region is also much wetter than the arid Almería province further east in Andalusia. Wikisource has the text of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica article "Cadiz (province)". In 2014 the unemployment rate was 42%, the highest in the country. The main industry is tourism, mainly from non-coastal Spanish cities, Germany and the UK. Its once-important shipbuilding industry (Astilleros) is now in crisis due to competition from South Korea and China. There are factories of Airbus and Delphi. It also exports sherry as well as alimentary products. Sherry production John Harvey & Sons in Jerez de la Frontera Gonzalez Byass Olive groves Fishing Ports, as in Cádiz and Algeciras.

Some of these beaches are relatively wild and far from big urban areas. One of the attractions of the area is its contrast to the mass tourism on the Mediterranean coast. There are extensive nature reserves in the region and the unspoilt feel of the area is heightened by the presence of wild animals including cows and horses on many stretches of beach. The Costa de la Luz has traditionally been a popular destination for Spaniards wanting to enjoy the beach while avoiding the stifling heat of the Mediterranean Coast, although until recently this largely unspoilt Atlantic coastline was little known to foreign visitors. One of the factors that brought the region to the attention of foreign holidaymakers was the growing realisation that its Southern reaches are one of the world's best locations for wind sports. Tarifa, located on the Strait of Gibraltar at the southernmost point of mainland Europe, has become Europe's foremost kitesurfing destination due to the area's unique wind phenomena, reliably sunny summer weather and the variety of beaches at locations such as Los Canos de Meca, Bolonia, Punta Paloma and, most famously, Playa de Los Lances where in the summer months you will often see over 1,000 kites in the air. The local economy has benefited significantly from the wind sport explosion: there are more than 50 kite schools in Tarifa and hundreds of shops, bars and hotels serving the many thousands of kitesurfers who visit every year.
