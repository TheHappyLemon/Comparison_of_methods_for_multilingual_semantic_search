Rösrath (German: [ˈʁøːsˌʁaːt]; Kölsch: Röhsroth [ˈʁœs²ˌʁɔt²])[what does "²" mean?] is a town in the Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis (district) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The earliest known documents mentioning the settlement Rösrath can be found in documents dated to 1356. There have been findings of Paleolithic and Mesolithic tools in the town area Forsbach. The community was elevated to the town status in 2001. Rösrath is located in the immediate vicinity of Cologne. The municipal area of Rösrath is bordering on the south-eastern city limits of Cologne. Therefore, from Cologne's point of view Rösrath is called a Gateway to the Berg region (Bergisches Land). The municipal area partly extends over the nature reserves of the Wahner Heide and Königsforst.
