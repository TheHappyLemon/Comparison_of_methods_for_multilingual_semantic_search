At only twelve years old, he was the youngest player ever to receive this honour. Wind played 12 games for Denmark's U17 national team and three matches for the U18 national team. He scored eight goals in nine matches for the U19 national team. In March 2019, he had his two first matches in the U21 national team, scoring in the second against Belgium in the 90th minute. In July 2012, Wind was admitted to the FCK School of Excellence. He played for the club's U17, U18 and U19 teams until 2018.

On 6 August 2019, Wind scored a Panenka penalty kick in the exact same stadium as the original Panenka forcing the goalkeeper to his right and chipping the ball in high in the middle of the goal.
