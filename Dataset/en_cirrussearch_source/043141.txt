Marcos Javier Acu√±a (born 28 October 1991) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a left back for La Liga club Sevilla and the Argentina national team. Acu√±a began his athletic training at Club Don Bosco in his hometown. At that time he played as a left wing-back. His good performance got him noticed by scouts who invited him to perform tests at various clubs in Buenos Aires. Thus, at age 13 he tried out for but did not stay at Boca Juniors and San Lorenzo de Almagro.[citation needed] Four years later he tried out for Quilmes, River Plate and Tigre before ultimately being taken by Ferro Carril Oeste. After a few seasons in Ferro's reserve team, he was promoted to the first team. He made his debut in 2009 in a match in the Primera B Nacional playing as a winger under coach Jos√© Mar√≠a Bianco. Already in the 2013‚Äì14 season he stood out for his ability to assist his peers, providing 12 assists, which caught the attention of major clubs. At Ferro, Acu√±a played a total of 117 matches, with 5 goals and 23 assists. On 18 July 2014, Acu√±a moved to Racing Club for a net fee of 4,900,000 pesos for 50% of his rights, with the option to buy another 25% at $750,000. On 27 July 2014, he played his first game with the Academia in a match for the knockout phase of the 2013‚Äì14 Copa Argentina against San Mart√≠n de San Juan, in which he also scored the winning goal on a header to give Racing a 1‚Äì0 victory. Later that year he was part of Racing's championship team that won the 2014 Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n, cutting a streak of 13 years without titles for the Avellaneda side, in which Acu√±a played 15 games and scored two goals. On 12 June 2017, Racing president V√≠ctor Blanco confirmed that Acu√±a would be leaving the club for Sporting CP. He made his debut for the Portuguese team in a 2‚Äì0 away victory over Desportivo Aves. On 15 May 2018, Acu√±a and several of his teammates, including coaches, were injured following an attack by around 50 supporters of Sporting at the club's training ground after the team finished third in the league and missed out on the UEFA Champions League qualification. Despite the attack, he and the rest of the team agreed to play in the Portuguese Cup final scheduled for the following weekend, eventually losing to C.D. Aves. On 14 September 2020, Acu√±a joined Spanish club Sevilla on a four-year deal. On 7 November 2021, Acu√±a scored his first league goal of the 2021‚Äì22 season in the el gran derbi where Sevilla won 2‚Äì0 against Real Betis. On 13 February 2021, he extended his contract with Sevilla until 2025. On 15 November 2016, Acu√±a made his international debut with the Argentina national team in a World Cup Qualifier 2018 match against Colombia. He was part of Argentina's squad that won the 2021 Copa Am√©rica. Acu√±a represented Argentina in the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. He won the latter edition of the tournament, playing all games except for the semifinal against Croatia in which he was suspended.
