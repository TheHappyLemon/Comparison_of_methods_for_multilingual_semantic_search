His monograph "The Social and Political Dimensions of the Latvian Prose Poem" was published by Pisa University Press in 2010. Vērdiņš has received prizes from the annual poetry festival in Latvia (2008) and from the newspaper "Diena" (2001 and 2008), as well as the annual Literature prize for best children's book of the year (2007). In 2012, he represented Latvia at the Poetry Parnassus festival – part of the Cultural Olympiad in London. His poem "Come to Me" was included in the list of the fifty greatest modern love poems, chosen by poetry specialists at the London's Southbank Centre in 2014. A selection of Vērdiņš' poems, translated into English, was published by Arc Publications in 2015. When reviewing this book the poet and critic Gregory Woods wrote, "his first person is singularly hard to pin down, apparently detached while involved, precise while vague, inventing stuff while accurately recording memory. The voices he adopts comment wryly on a world in which nothing could surprise us, even while everything takes our breath away. The reader finds she has to check the ground beneath her feet." 300 Baltic Writers: Estonia Latvia Lithuania. Vilnius: Institute of Lithuanian Literature and Folklore, 2009, p. 352.
