Hola Prystan (Ukrainian: Го́ла При́стань, pronounced [ˈɦɔɫɐ ˈprɪstɐnʲ]) is a city in Skadovsk Raion, Kherson Oblast, southern Ukraine occupied by Russia. It hosts the administration of the Hola Prystan urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. It has a population of 13,544 (2022 estimate). The Konka, a tributary of the Dnieper, flows through the city. Until 18 July, 2020, Hola Prystan was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and the center of Hola Prystan Municipality. It also served as the administrative center of Hola Prystan Raion, though it did not belong to the raion. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kherson Oblast to five. The area of Hola Prystan Municipality was merged into Skadovsk Raion. Hola Prystan – literally meaning barren pier – was founded in 1709 by Zaporizhian Cossacks of Oleshky Sich as Holyi Pereviz (barren ford), but has been known by its current name since 1785. Jews apparently began to settle in the town at the beginning of the 19th century and by 1897 they numbered 667, or 11 percent of the total population. At the turn of the century many of the businesses in the town were owned by Jews. In 1905 there was a pogrom in which 2 Jewish shops were destroyed. The pogrom was stopped not by the authorities but by peasants who did not take part in the attack on the Jews. Under the Soviets the Jewish population of Hola Prystan fell, mainly due to migration to larger cities in search of jobs and education opportunities. In 1939 the town's 276 Jews comprised 3.6 percent of the total population. Hola Prystan was occupied by German troops on September 13, 1941, and on October 12 the same year the resident Jews were shot outside the town. It was liberated by the Red Army on November 4, 1943. On 1 August 1997 a Project R1415 (NATO code: Flamingo class) Ukrainian patrol boat was named after the town. Hola Prystan was granted the status of regional town on May 17, 2013. It has been occupied by Russian forces since 2022, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On March 8, 2022, a few thousand people protested the occupation. Hola Prystan was shelled by Ukrainian forces during the war. In 2023, Russian forces opened fire with multiple launch rocket systems in Hola Prystan and Kherson, damaging residential houses and injuring civilians. Due to the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, Hola Prystan was flooded. According to Svitlana Linnyk, the head of Hola Prystan city military administration, around 80-85% of the city was submerged.
