"Forever" is a song by rappers Drake, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, and Eminem. Written alongside producer Boi-1da, the song was originally released as the third single from the soundtrack to LeBron James's More than a Game documentary and was placed on the Refill re-release of Eminem's album Relapse. Eminem performed his verse of the song at the American Music Awards of 2009. Drake performed the song with Lil Wayne, Eminem, and Travis Barker at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. A demo version of the song was leaked in mid-2008. The track was produced by Boi-1da and originally used by Kardinal Offishall featuring Rock City in early 2008, as "Bring It Back". Kardinal did not use the song for his album and it was later re-sold to Drake, who released it in late 2008 as "I Want This Forever" featuring Lil Wayne and Kidd Kidd. In an interview, Kardinal stated that his version was a leaked demo which was supposed to appear on his album Not 4 Sale, as well as a soundtrack. The 2009 version of "Forever" features Kanye West, Lil Wayne, and Eminem. Rapper Jay-Z called it the best posse cut of the decade. The song title is derived from the last line of the chorus; I want this shit forever man. The song gained a lot of attention from Eminem fans especially due to the story behind the song. According to an interview with Kanye West talking about the song, he said, "When I heard Eminem's verse on the Drake shit, I went back and rewrote my shit for two days. I cancelled appointments to rewrite!" Similarly, Lil Wayne rewrote his verse after hearing Eminem's. In response to this, Eminem told Complex, "Everybody approached the beat different […] For some reason, I felt the beat was a double-time beat, so I rapped faster." The song is written in the key of C minor, with a tempo of 80 beats per minute. The music video was shot in Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami, Florida, in early September 2009. However, Eminem's part in the video was shot in Detroit due to scheduling conflicts and not being able to be in Miami. The music video was shot and directed by Hype Williams.[citation needed] It premiered on September 22, 2009, on BET's music program 106 & Park. LeBron James appears in the opening of the music video in the back seat of a Maybach playing online poker on PokerStars on his customized Beats by Dr. Dre's laptop. Throughout the video, there are clips and pictures from the documentary about James, More than a Game, and of him as a child playing basketball. Also The Alchemist, Trick-Trick, Mr. Porter, Swifty McVay, Kuniva, Bizarre and Slaughterhouse all make cameo appearances in Eminem's verse of the video behind him as he raps his verse. Birdman makes a cameo appearances in the video on Lil Wayne's verse, sitting next to him in the VIP section of the club. The music video was produced alongside the video for "Money to Blow". Jason Thurston of Allmusic.com marked the song as one of the standout tracks of the album, writing: "The record hits a high point early on the six-minute epic 'Forever,' a convention of rap's wordsmiths as Kanye West, Drake, Lil Wayne, and Eminem pass the baton over a dark, soulful, slightly mournful beat, separated by an echoing modern R&B Auto-Tune hook." Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic.com also highlighted the song, and commented: "['Forever'] is none too coincidentally the one track in the entirety of Eminem's 2009 comeback that feels utterly modern."
