The Hyatt Regency Paris Étoile is a skyscraper hotel located near the Porte Maillot in the 17th arrondissement of Paris, France. The 995-room hotel was built in 1974 as the Hôtel Concorde La Fayette, and is the second largest in Paris after the Le Méridien Étoile. The hotel is part of the Palais des Congrès, one of the city's convention centers. It is the third-tallest building in the city of Paris (which does not contain the La Défense business district). A spire of 53 metres stands on its roof. The hotel's location was formerly a free space, hosting amusement parks during the summer. After World War II, temporary buildings were quickly built there in order to host some services from French ministries. In 1960, facing the international boom in tourist and congress activities, the Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie and the Tourism Committee decided to build a convention centre on the site. The selected architects were Henri Guibout, Serge Maloletenkov and Yves Betin. During that study, it was decided to build a large luxury hotel adjacent to the centre. The hotel opened in 1974 as the Hôtel Concorde La Fayette. It was sold in 2013 by Starwood Capital to Constellation Hotel Holdings (a division of Qatar Holdings) and became the Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile on 23 April 2013. 137 metres high, 190 metres with its antenna 995 rooms and suites on 34 floors Mayo Restaurant A Windo Skybar panoramic bar on the 34th floor 35 reception rooms totalling 2,800 m2 of meeting space The Hyatt Catering service, which serves practical and gourmet dining in all areas of the Palais des Congrès Skyscraper List of tallest structures in Paris "Qatar buys four luxury hotels in France from Starwood Capital and appoints Hyatt as operator".
