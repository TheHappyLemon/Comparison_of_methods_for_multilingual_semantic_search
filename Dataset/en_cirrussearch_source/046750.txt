FK Vėtra was a Lithuanian football team from the capital city of Vilnius.

In 2004, Vėtra played in the Intertoto Cup and reached the 3rd round with 3 wins, 2 draws, and 1 loss, including the elimination of Scottish side Hibernian FC.

Vėtra lost to English side Blackburn Rovers in the third round. [1]. In the 2008 edition of the UEFA Cup Vėtra lost to Viking Stavanger despite winning the first leg thanks to a bizarre goal.
