As a child, Farmiga converted with her family from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church to Pentecostalism. Farmiga considers herself to be "100% Ukrainian American".

When she was 12, the family moved from Irvington to Whitehouse Station, New Jersey.

In her final year at Syracuse, she portrayed Nina Zarechnaya in The Seagull at the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival, and the production won the top prize.

Farmiga won the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress for her performance.

She received nominations in both acting and directing for the film, including the Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Director, and the Satellite Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture. In his film review, critic Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter noted: "Directing debuts by actors don't come any better than this". Of her performance, Leonard Maltin of IndieWire remarked that Farmiga "gives an honest, empathetic performance should come as no surprise; she is one of the most gifted and daring actresses of our time".
