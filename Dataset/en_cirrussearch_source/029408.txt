Modřice (Czech pronunciation: [ˈmodr̝ɪtsɛ]; German: Mödritz) is a town in Brno-Country District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 5,600 inhabitants. Modřice is located about 6 kilometres (4 mi) south of Brno. It lies in the Dyje–Svratka Valley. It is situated on the right bank of the Svratka River. The first written mention of Modřice is from 1141. There used to be a castle owned by the Olomouc bishops. In the 13th century, Germanic settlers came and mixed with the original Slavic population. In the first half of the 20th century, Germans formed majority of the population. After the World War II, German inhabitants were expelled and the municipality was resettled by Czechs. Modřice became a town in 1994. The D2 motorway from Brno to Břeclav runs next to the town. The Church of Saint Gotthard is the landmark of the town. The original Romanesque structure was completely rebuilt in the 1780s. It has preserved Romanesque core, Renaissance portal and late Baroque tower.
