Bohemia competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, England as an independent team, though it was part of Austria-Hungary at the time. Bohemia refused to fence Italy in the silver medal match of the men's team sabre, contending that the repechage system was unfair. All 4 Bohemian wrestlers lost their first match. This fencer competed in the team event, but is not listed in the IOC medallist database. Cook, Theodore Andrea (1908). The Fourth Olympiad, Being the Official Report.
