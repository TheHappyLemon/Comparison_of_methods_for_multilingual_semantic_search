Human activity in the territory of the modern Dibër County can be traced back to the Neolithic. The region that today corresponds to the county territory was inhabited by the ancient Illyrian tribe of Penestae. They were the first people to leave lasting traces and cultural heritage throughout the region. It is evidenced by the settlements of the Early Bronze Age in Manasdren, the Middle Bronze Age in Çetush, the Late Bronze Age in Pesjakë and several others. In the Middle Ages, Dibër was part of the Principality of Kastrioti ruled by the royal Kastrioti family with Gjon Kastrioti on the Albanian throne. After the death of Gjon Kastrioti in 1437, the eastern region was annexed by the Ottomans and became seat of the Sanjak of Dibra. The comprising regions were awarded to his son Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg, where he survived to conquer back his father’s land and unite all of Albania in 1444. In the 15th century, further during the Albanian wars the region was the frontier between the Ottomans and the League of Lezhë. In the 19th century, the Congress of Dibër declared the Albanian language as an official language within the Ottoman Empire. After the Balkan Wars and following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the great powers established the borders of the Balkan states at the Conference of London. The Dibër Valley was cut in half. The western part was assigned to Albania, while the eastern part went to the Kingdom of Serbia, today North Macedonia.
