Imphal (Meitei: [im.pʰal]; English: UK: /ˈɪmfəl/, US: /ˈɪmpˌhʌl/) is the capital city of the Indian state of Manipur. It is the second largest city in Northeast India after Guwahati. The metropolitan centre of the city contains the ruins of Kangla Palace (officially known as Kangla Fort), the royal seat of the former Kingdom of Manipur, surrounded by a moat. Spread over parts of the districts of Imphal West and Imphal East, the former contains the majority of the city's area and population. Imphal is part of the Smart Cities Mission under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Being a mega commercial hub, Imphal is known for its weaving, brass-ware, bronze-ware, and other cottage industries. Meitei language (officially known as Manipuri language) is the most widely spoken language in the city. INS Imphal, the third ship of the Visakhapatnam-class stealth guided missile destroyer of the Indian Navy, was named in recognition of the Indian soldiers who fought in Battle of Imphal during World War II, and is the first Indian Navy Ship (INS), named after a city in Northeast India. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, Imphal is the only city of Manipur. Imphal is derived from two words: "Yum" meaning house and "Phal" meaning "plenty" or "beautiful". In old Manipuri language, "yum" is also spelt as "im". Even today, Imphal is occasionally pronounced as "yum-phal." Initially ruled by King Khaba, Imphal was later ruled by the Pakhangba leaders. The clan of the Ningthouja tribe originated then. The Ningthouja tribe quickly expanded and dominated the region in politics and war. Kangla Palace was built by King Khagemba and his son Khunjaoba. The palace was later destroyed by the British during the Anglo-Manipur War. During the reign of Maharaja Bhagyachandra, there were a number of Burmese invasions. However, the kingdom survived with the help of Maharaj Gambhir Singh. Imphal remained peaceful until 1891, when there were internal differences in the royal family. The British sent J.W. Quinton to help but the situation only grew worse and Senapati Tikendrajit was hanged. The autocratic British behavior made people angry. This resulted in the 1891 Anglo-Manipur War, which the British won. The Battle of Imphal took place between March and July 1944, during World War II. The Japanese had invaded Imphal to destroy Allied forces and then invade India, but they were defeated and forced to retreat. The attack made the British realise the militarily strategic position of Imphal. Imphal lies on the Imphal Valley surrounded by nine ranges of hills at 24°48′27″N 93°56′18″E﻿ / ﻿24.8074°N 93.9384°E﻿ / 24.8074; 93.9384 in extreme eastern India, with an average elevation of 786 metres (2,579 ft). It has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cwa) with cool, dry winters and a slightly hot monsoon season. Imphal enjoys a moderate climate tempered by its high altitude and the surrounding hills. Maximum temperatures in the hottest months average about 29 °C (84 °F); January is the coldest month, with average lows near 4 °C (39 °F), often drops to around 2 °C in the coldest nights and rarely drops below freezing point. The city receives about 1,381 mm (54.4 in) of rain, with June and July being the wettest months. Imphal observes 42.2 days with thunder and 46.1 days with fog, anuually. Thunder is common in the rainy season, whereas fog mostly occurs in the dry winter season. The highest recorded temperature was 36.1 °C (97.0 °F), on 29 April 1999, and the lowest temperature was −2.7 °C (27.1 °F) on 10 January 1970.

The British established the Town Fund Board in Imphal in 1915, which was headed by the then Political Agent Lt. Col. H.W.G. Cole and other nominated members. The Town Fund Board continued after Independence and merger with India in 1949 and it was not headed by the Chief Secretary of Manipur Administration. In 1956, the Assam Municipal Act, 1923 was extended to Manipur and the Imphal Municipal Board was formed with 12 elected members. The strength of the elected members of this Board was increased to 24 in 1961 and to 28 in 1972. Initially, the Municipal Board was established only to administer the areas in Imphal under the British Reserve, covering 3.10 km2 (1.20 sq mi) and 2,862 inhabitants. This was extended to 17.48 km2 (6.75 sq mi) in 1960, 18.25 km2 (7.05 sq mi) in 1970, and 76.58 km2 (29.57 sq mi) in 1972. In 1992, the Municipal Board was upgraded to a Municipal Council under the Manipur Municipality Act, 1994. In 2014, the council was upgraded to the status of Municipal Corporation. There are 27 wards under the Municipal Corporation, each with its own elected councillor. There are eight committees and five sections at the corporation to govern the administration of the city.

The local ward councillor is the chairperson of the committee, which includes two elected and two nominated members as well. The last election to the corporation was in 2016, with INC winning 12 seats, BJP winning 10 seats, and independent candidates winning 5 seats. According to the Manipur Municipality Act, 1994, the mayor is indirectly elected by the elected councillors from amongst themselves.
