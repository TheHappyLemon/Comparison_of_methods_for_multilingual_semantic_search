Alecia Beth Moore was born on September 8, 1979, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, to emergency room nurse Judith Moore (née Kugel) and insurance salesman James Moore. She has described herself as an "Irish-German-Lithuanian Jew"; her mother is Jewish. Although a healthy baby, she developed asthma that plagued her through her early years. When Pink was a toddler, her parents began having marital problems; they divorced before she was 10. Pink was trained as a competitive gymnast between the ages 4 and 12. She attended Central Bucks High School West. In high school, Pink joined her first band, Middleground, but it disbanded upon losing a Battle of the Bands competition. As a teenager, she wrote lyrics as an outlet for her feelings, and her mother commented, "Her initial writings were always very introspective. Some of it was very black, and very deep, almost worrisome." Pink began performing in Philadelphia clubs when she was about 14 years old. She adopted her nickname "Pink" as her stage name around this time. She has given different explanations about how she came to be given that nickname, which she has had since she was a child. At 14, she was convinced to audition to become a member of the all-female group Basic Instinct, and earned a spot in the lineup. Ultimately, the group disbanded without releasing any material. At 15, Pink and two other teenage girls, Sharon Flanagan and Chrissy Conway, formed the R&B group Choice. A copy of their first song, "Key to My Heart", was sent to LaFace Records in Atlanta, Georgia, where L.A. Reid overheard it and arranged for the group to fly there so he could see them perform. Afterward, he signed them to a recording contract with the label. Since the three girls were under 18 at the time, their parents had to cosign the contract. The group relocated to the label's then-headquarters in Atlanta to record an album. Despite it failing to see a commercial release, their song "Key to My Heart" appeared on the soundtrack to the 1996 film Kazaam. During a Christmas party, Reid gave Pink an ultimatum: "go solo or go home." Choice subsequently disbanded in 1998. After Choice disbanded, Pink signed a recording contract with LaFace Records and began working on her first solo album with producers such as Babyface, Kandi Burruss and Tricky Stewart. Her first solo single, "There You Go", was released in February 2000 and became her first top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at number seven. Internationally, the song also charted inside the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In April, Pink's album, Can't Take Me Home, was released to commercial success. It peaked 26 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for two million units shipped in the United States. It also went platinum in the United Kingdom and multi-platinum in Australia and Canada, while selling over four million copies worldwide. Critical reception to the album was mixed. The album's second single, "Most Girls", peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her first chart-topping single in Australia. "You Make Me Sick" was released as the final single and reached number 33 on the Hot 100. Pink won the trophy for Female New Artist of the Year at the 2000 Billboard Music Awards. She was billed as a supporting act on the North American leg of NSYNC's No Strings Attached Tour throughout the summer of 2000. In 2001, Pink, alongside singers Christina Aguilera and Mýa as well as rapper Lil' Kim, performed a cover of "Lady Marmalade" for the soundtrack of the film Moulin Rouge!. In the US it became the most successful airplay-only single in history, as well as Pink's first No. 1 single. The success of the single was helped by its music video, which was popular on music channels and won the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year. The song won Pink's first Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Tired of being marketed as another cookie cutter pop act, as well as eager both to be seen as a more serious songwriter and musician and to perform the type of music she wanted to, Pink took her sound in a new direction and sought more artistic or creative control during the recording of her second album, Missundaztood. She recruited Linda Perry, former singer of 4 Non Blondes (one of Pink's favorite groups in her teenage years). Pink moved into Perry's Los Angeles home where the pair spent several months writing songs for the album. Perry co-wrote and co-produced the album with Dallas Austin and Scott Storch, and according to VH1's Driven program, Antonio "LA" Reid of LaFace Records was not initially content with the new music Pink was making. The album, named Missundaztood because of Pink's belief that people had a wrong image of her, was released in November 2001. "Get the Party Started" was released as the lead single and peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. It also became a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Romania, and Spain, as well as spending four weeks at the top of the European Hot 100 Singles chart. At the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, its music video won in the categories of Best Female Video and Best Dance Video. The album's other singles—"Don't Let Me Get Me", "Just Like a Pill", and "Family Portrait"—were also radio and chart successes, with "Just Like a Pill" becoming Pink's second number-one hit in the United Kingdom. Missundaztood remains Pink's best-selling record with over 13 million copies sold worldwide. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Missundaztood was the eighth best-selling album of 2002 globally. Pink won a World Music Award for Best Selling American Pop/Rock Female Artist. She was also nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 45th Grammy Awards.

Of Joplin, Pink said, "She was so inspiring by singing blues music when it wasn't culturally acceptable for white women, and she wore her heart on her sleeve. She was so witty and charming and intelligent, but she also battled an ugly-duckling syndrome. I would love to play her in a movie." In a tribute performance on her Try This Tour, Pink called Joplin "a woman who inspired me when everyone else ... didn't!" As a child, Pink admired the leader of 4 Non Blondes, Linda Perry, whom she tracked down and formed a close relationship with on her second album. She said: Literally this woman spoke to me. Being in pain and being on drugs and being misunderstood and, yeah she spoke my language. Without having to say anything, she could sing a note and it was what I was feeling. I used to sit at three or four o' clock in the morning, tripping on whatever, screaming 4 Non Blondes out the window until the cops were called. Throughout her career, Pink has received acclaim from critics for her powerful singing abilities. Pink is a contralto, whose voice has been described as "raspy", "husky", and "distinctive". NBC News music critic Maura Johnston said that, at times, "the sheer power of her alto" has been overshadowed by her skills as an aerialist. James Montgomery of MTV calls her "a deceptively good singer ... who can out-sing almost anyone". The Guardian called her voice "prodigious". Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times labeled her "a powerhouse vocalist". Pink has also been noted for her "raw", "soulful" voice and her ability to emote. The Inquirer called her voice "husky" and "gutsy", and wrote that she had developed into a "powerfully emotive vocalist", comparing her to Janis Joplin. The Star Tribune wrote, "Her slightly raspy, slightly soulful voice made you feel the dysfunction in 'Family Portrait', the longing of 'Who Knew' and the empowerment in 'Perfect'." CNN has said that Pink is known for singing "with the right level of emotion". Fellow artist Kelly Clarkson has called Pink's voice "the best of our generation". Troy L. Smith, writing for Cleveland.com, called Pink one of her generation's most underrated vocalists, writing that she is capable of "sing[ing] anything, from rock and pop to folk and R&B." Smith named her 2006's second best vocalist, runner-up to Carrie Underwood. Aside from her music, Pink has been noted for her fashion style, such as her "adventurous" hairstyles, which have ranged from fluorescent spikes to pink-streaked dreadlocks to a pitch-black skater cut. Billboard described her style as "androgynous" and "gender-bending". She told InStyle, "I'm eclectic. I'm a tomboy, but I'm kind of a hippie and kind of a gangster ... I don't know if that's a good thing, but it is my thing." On August 21, 2018, Pink stopped her concert in Brisbane for a grieving fan. A girl named Leah lost her mother one month before the concert, and she and her family hung up signs all around the concert, saying "My name is Leah – I'm 14 years old. I lost my beautiful Mum last month. I would LOVE a hug... Please!" The signs grabbed Pink's attention. On Women's Equality Day in 2019, Gillie and Marc Art unveiled a bronze sculpture of Pink as a part of Statues for Equality mission. Pink is also involved with several charities and campaigns, including Human Rights Campaign, ONE Campaign, The Prince's Trust, New York Restoration Project, Run for the Cure Foundation, Save the Children, Take Back the Night, UNICEF, World Animal Protection, One Billion Rising, Youth Off The Streets, Black Lives Matter and Good Ride. In December 2015, Pink was appointed as a UNICEF Ambassador and the agency's Kid Power National Spokesperson in order to help raise awareness about its lifesaving health and nutrition programs around the world. She followed UNICEF to Haiti and witnessed the impact therapeutic food has on malnourished children. In 2023, the singer promoted the charity during the North American leg of the Summer Carnival Tour. QR codes for UNICEF USA were placed at all merchandise stands, which directed fans to purchase basic necessities and school supplies for children in need. In 2017, Pink and her husband joined a fundraising bike ride that raised $2,000,000 for the Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry campaign. She partnered with "Save With Stories", a No Kid Hungry collaboration with Save the Children, and read stories on Instagram for children who were out of school due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2023, Pink was awarded with the "National Champion Award" from No Kid Hungry, for "her commitment and contributions to help advance No Kid Hungry's national campaign to end childhood hunger in America". Pink and Kelly Clarkson helped raise $60,000 for No Kid Hungry and Sweet Relief Musicians Fund by auctioning off "one-of-a-kid" art pieces depicting their songs in sound waves. Later that year, Pink and her daughter collaborated with Williams Sonoma and designed spatulas for the annual "Tools for Change" fundraising program by No Kid Hungry. On February 16, 2009, Pink announced she was donating $250,000 to the Red Cross Bushfire Appeal to aid the victims of the bushfires that swept through the Australian state of Victoria earlier that month. Pink said she wanted to make "a tangible expression of support". She also donated money to Autism Speaks. Following Australia's bushfires in 2020, Pink donated $500,000 to the local fire services. Later that year, the singer donated $1,000,000 to help fight the pandemic following her recovery from COVID-19. The amount was split between the City of Los Angeles Mayor's Emergency COVID-19 Crisis Fund and the Temple University Hospital Fund in Philadelphia. In July 2021, she offered to pay the fines handed out to the Norwegian women's beach handball team after they wore shorts like their male counterparts instead of bikini bottoms. In 2022, Pink released a protest song "Irrelevant" and announced all of the proceeds would be donated to Michelle Obama's nonpartisan voting initiative "When We All Vote". Pink is an animal rights activist. In 2003, she declined an invitation to perform at Prince William's 21st birthday bash on account of the Royal Family's controversial stance on animal hunting. Pink is a prominent campaigner for PETA, contributing her voice to causes such as protest against KFC. In conjunction with PETA, she criticized the Australian wool industry for its use of mulesing. In 2007, she said PETA had misled her about mulesing and that she had not done enough research before lending her name to the campaign. Her campaigning led to a headlining concert called PAW (Party for Animals Worldwide) in Cardiff, Wales, on August 21, 2007. As of May 2008,[update] she has been officially recognized as an advocate for RSPCA Australia. The singer joined Ricky Gervais for PETA's "Stolen for Fashion" advertisement, which opposes wearing fur and animal skin. In 2014, Pink stated she opposes carriage riding in New York City. The singer asked Queen Elizabeth II why the bear fur on the Guards' caps hadn't been replaced with a synthetic, cruelty-free material in 2013. In 2015, she posed nude for PETA's "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" campaign. The singer opposed SeaWorld for "locking up" marine animals in sanctuaries where all they are able to do is "swim in endless circles" in 2018. Pink is also outspoken about LGBT rights and supports same-sex marriage. In her 2006 song "Dear Mr. President", she criticized then-President George Bush's opposition to gay marriage, singing: "What kind of father would hate his own daughter if she were gay?". In November 2008, Pink marched against Proposition 8, a proposition to ban gay marriage, at a rally in downtown Los Angeles. The singer was awarded with the "Ally for Equality Award" at the Human Rights Campaign Dinner in 2010. In an interview with Gaydar Radio from 2012, the singer stated: "I think that the best day will be when we no longer talk about being gay or straight – it's not a 'gay wedding', it's just a 'wedding'; it's not a 'gay marriage', it's just 'a marriage.'" In 2012, she told The Advocate that she had girlfriends in her twenties but does not define her sexual orientation, saying, "I never felt the need to." In the same interview, the singer mentioned her appreciation for her lesbian and bisexual female fans. In 2023, Billboard named her song "Raise Your Glass" as one of the top LGBT Anthems of All Time at number 31. In an interview with Gay Times, Pink stated that the queer community means "everything to her". She added: "I think [my LGBTQ+ following] just speaks to who I am and what I believe in, and what I've always been. I am definitely an ally and to be understood for that is a wonderful feeling. For any of us to be understood, that's what we want in life, right? We want to love, be loved and be seen." In 2017, Pink attended the Women's March, a widely attended protest in favor of women's rights and equality alongside her family. The singer partnered with REVERB on her Beautiful Trauma Tour to reduce its environmental footprint and empower fans to support her work with UNICEF and No Kid Hungry. Pink was awarded the "People's Champion Award" at the 2019 People's Choice Awards for her work with a number of organizations. Bally Total Fitness announced an endorsement deal with Pink in 2002, which included a hip-hop aerobics class dubbed "Get Your Body Started". In return, the fitness company served as the sponsor for The Party Tour and hosted several "Pink Parties", where dance competition contestants received Pink-related prizes. The singer also partnered with NBA Entertainment and recorded a musical spot for "Get the Party Started (NBA remix)" which promoted the league. In August 2006, Pink recorded "Waiting All Day for Sunday Night", which served as the opening theme for Sunday Night NFL until 2016. The song is a rework of Joan Jett's "I Hate Myself for Loving You". In 2004, Pink appeared in a Gladiator-themed Pepsi commercial with Britney Spears, Beyoncé and Enrique Iglesias. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe announced a collaboration with Pink in 2006, which included a limited edition "P!nk PSP Value Pack". PSP Senior Brand Manager for SCEE Stephane Hareau stated: "The P!nk PSP launch is much more than just launching a new colour. It is about a confident and powerful attitude for young women. The association with P!nk, a worldwide icon and musical chameleon, will enable PSP to push new boundaries." On April 3, 2009, Optus announced a Pre-Paid mobile campaign with the singer. The following year, Pink fronted a multi-million dollar TV campaign for V8 Supercars Australia. She served as their ambassador until 2012. In August 2012, Pink became a spokesmodel for CoverGirl, featuring in a fall 2013 advertising campaign themed "beauty with an edge". In 2013, Pink purchased an 18-acre organic vineyard in Santa Barbara County. Five years later she launched her own brand of wine called "Two Wolves". Though a high-school dropout, the singer took winemaking courses at the University of California and Wine & Spirit Education Trust. Two Wolves makes different types of wine, including graciano, syrah, sauvignon blanc, and others. The wine can be tasted in different restaurants across the United States and Australia. In January 2023, the singer partnered with Pfizer and recorded a commercial alongside Questlove, Jean Smart, and Michael Phelps to emphasize the importance of acting fast after testing positive for COVID-19. Pink has been credited for breaking boundaries and pushing the envelope throughout her career. She is regarded as the "most trailblazing artist" of her pop generation. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times says, "Pink stood up for her music, broke the music industry's mold and scored a breakout hit, challenging a school of teen singers to find their own sounds as well." He adds, "[Pink] also started a race among other teen pop stars like Christina Aguilera to add substance to their own sound." Ann Powers refers to her as a "powerhouse vocalist", stating her mix of rebellion, emotional rawness, humor, and "infectious" dance beats created "a model for the mashup approach of latter-day divas such as Katy Perry, Kesha, and Rihanna." Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone commented: "I think people respond to her sense of independence and dedication. It inspires people... This is a prolific pop artist who is sometimes famous and successful, sometimes obscure, who nonetheless keeps making her own kind of music." James Montgomery of MTV describes her as "a fabulously fearless pop artist" who can "out-sing almost anyone out there. She can out-crazy Gaga or Lily. She's the total pop-star package, everything you'd want in a singer/entertainer/icon. And still, she remains oddly off the radar. Such is the price of busting borders". Entertainment Weekly said: "She essentially invented the whole modern wave of Pop Diva Domination: You can draw a straight line from "Get This Party Started" to Katy Perry, Kesha, pre-messianic Lady Gaga, and post-weird Rihanna." Glamour Magazine wrote: "When Pennsylvania-born Alecia Moore debuted in 2000, pop was dominated by long-locked blonds like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson. Pink changed the game. Without her, the last 13 years of big-voiced, tough chick music is hard to imagine."[better source needed] Following her performance at the American Music Awards of 2012, LZ Granderson of CNN wrote: our culture's biggest sin may well be the auto-tuned syrup we've allowed to dominate the pop charts. All-time chart records are handed to vacuous acts such as the Black Eyed Peas and singing awards are given to vocal lightweights such as Taylor Swift [...] But thank God for Pink. [...] While Christina Aguilera has a tendency to oversing, Britney Spears can't sing, and Lauryn Hill sorta stopped singing, Pink has managed to carve a brilliant 13-year career by being something that is incredibly rare these days—an artist. British soul singer Adele considers Pink's performance at Brixton Academy in London one of "the most defining moments" in her life, saying, "It was the Missundaztood record, so I was about 13 or 14. I had never heard, being in the room, someone sing like that live. I remember sort of feeling like I was in a wind tunnel, her voice just hitting me. It was incredible." Pink's work has inspired many other artists, including Christina Aguilera, Demi Lovato, Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Tegan and Sara, Ashley Tisdale, Alessia Cara, Victoria Justice, Adele, Julia Michaels, Ben Hopkins of Pwr Bttm Dua Lipa, Bebe Rexha, Halsey, Anne Marie, Kehlani, and Daya. Pink met professional motocross racer Carey Hart at the 2001 X Games in Philadelphia. Following a brief separation in 2003, Pink proposed to Hart in June 2005 during a Mammoth Lakes motocross race; she was "assisting" in his race and wrote "Will U Marry Me?" on a pit board. He either did not notice or ignored it and continued for another lap. Then Pink added "Serious!" to the board, and he pulled off the track to accept. She then made him finish the race. They married in Costa Rica on January 7, 2006. After months of speculation, Pink announced in February 2008 that she and Hart had separated. Hart subsequently appeared in the video for her 2008 song "So What", which deals with their separation. The couple sought marriage counseling during their separation in hopes of reconciliation. In February 2010, Pink confirmed that she and Hart were back together. Hart also appears with Pink in the videos for her songs "Just Like a Pill" (from her 2001 album M!ssundaztood), "Just Give Me a Reason", "True Love" (both from her 2012 album The Truth About Love), "Just Like Fire" (from the soundtrack to the 2016 film Alice Through the Looking Glass), "90 Days" (from her 2019 album Hurts 2B Human) and "All I Know So Far" (from her 2021 live album All I Know So Far: Setlist). In November 2010, Pink announced on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she and Hart were expecting their first child. In June 2011, she gave birth to their daughter, Willow Sage Hart. In 2018, Willow released a cover of the reprise of "A Million Dreams (Reprise)" for The Greatest Showman: Reimagined soundtrack, and in 2021, she released "Cover Me in Sunshine" with her mother. In December 2016, Pink gave birth to their second child, a son. Pink is a supporter of attachment parenting. In 2010, she appeared on Forbes' "The Celebrity 100" list at number 27, with earnings of $44 million. In 2011, she appeared on Forbes' The Top-Earning Women in Music list at number 6 with earnings of $22 million, with an average of $1 million per show on the road. In 2009, Billboard put her number 6 on their "Money Makers" list, listing her earnings as $36,347,658. In 2013, she appeared on Forbes' list of "Highest Paid Musicians", with earnings of $32 million. In 2018, she appeared on Forbes' list of "Highest Paid Female Celebrities", with earnings of $52 million. On April 4, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Pink announced that she and her three-year-old son, Jameson, showed symptoms for COVID-19 and she subsequently tested positive, but fully recovered. She also announced donations of $500,000 each to the Temple University Hospital Fund in Philadelphia, where her mother worked for nearly two decades, and the City of Los Angeles Mayor's Emergency COVID-19 Crisis Fund. She has had asthma her whole life, and the initial days of fighting the virus exacerbated her condition. In 2019, Pink revealed to Carson Daly that she struggles with anxiety and depression. The singer had a miscarriage at 17 years old. Pink has won over 100 awards, including three Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards (including Outstanding Contribution to Music), a Daytime Emmy Award and seven MTV Video Music Awards (including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award). Billboard named her Woman of the Year in 2013. Pink received the BMI President's Award for "her outstanding achievement in songwriting and global impact on pop culture and the entertainment industry." In 2019, the singer received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was also named as Pollstar's 2019 Artist of the Year. Following the success of The Beautiful Trauma Tour, Pink accepted the Legend of Live Award at the Billboard Live Music Summit. Three years later, Pink received the Icon Award at the Billboard Music Awards. In 2023, iHeartRadio Music Awards awarded the singer with the Icon Award to recognize her "impact on pop culture, longevity and continued relevance as a touring and radio force with a loyal fan base worldwide." She was also honored by the Songwriters of North America for her achievement in the industry and her activism efforts. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Pink's record sales stand at 16 million copies in the United States. Pink has sold over 60 million albums and 75 million singles worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. Billboard included the singer in its list of Greatest of All Time Pop Songs Artists (2018) at number two and named her one of the 100 most successful artists of the 2010s by including her in its Top Artists of the 2010s Chart (2019). Billboard also added her sophomore album Missundaztood in the Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums (2015) list at number 157. PPL announced in 2021, that Pink was the most-played female artist of the 21st century in the United Kingdom.
