"Cool" is a song by American singer Gwen Stefani from her debut solo studio album, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). Written by Stefani and Dallas Austin, the song was released as the fourth single from the album on July 5, 2005. The song's musical style and production were inspired by synth-pop and new wave arrangements from the 1980s, and its lyrics chronicle a relationship in which two lovers have separated, but remain "cool" with each other as good friends. "Cool" received generally positive reviews from music critics, being compared to Cyndi Lauper and Madonna songs from the 1980s. The media have drawn parallels between the song's lyrical content and the romantic relationship that Stefani had with Tony Kanal, a fellow band member of No Doubt. "Cool" was moderately successful on the charts around the world, peaking within the top 10 in Australia, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and New Zealand, as well as the top 20 in Denmark, Ireland, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. The accompanying music video for "Cool" was directed by Sophie Muller and filmed in Lake Como, Italy. The video features many flashbacks to when Stefani and her former boyfriend were dating. It is implied that whilst Gwen accepts the new relationship her ex-partner is in, she looks back with nostalgia and regret. "Cool" was included on the setlist for Stefani's debut solo tour Harajuku Lovers Tour and its accompanying video album, as well as in the 2006 comedies Last Holiday and Click and the 2010 drama Somewhere. After listening to No Doubt's 2002 single "Underneath It All", Austin commented that he was trying to write his version of No Doubt's 2000 single "Simple Kind of Life", but he was unable to finish the song. He originally wrote the song for Christina Aguilera and TLC. However, Austin felt reluctant to give the song to TLC after breaking up with group member Chilli and wrote "Damaged" for them instead. He asked Stefani to help with the lyrics. During a studio session together, they finished "Cool" in 15 minutes. Stefani commented, "When he told me about the track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me." The lyrics of "Cool" reflect Stefani's previous relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal, and is considered somewhat of a follow-up to No Doubt's 1996 single "Don't Speak". The earlier song is about the heartbreak of the couple's seven-year relationship ending, while "Cool" presents an amicable friendship between the pair, and explains that after the years that have passed and everything they have been through, they have reached a place where they are comfortable with each other and that they still remain very good friends. Stefani said that she had never intended to include personal material on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and commented, "but no matter what you do, things just come out. It just ended this whole thing for me in my head and it puts an end to a chapter in a really nice way."

"Cool" is a mid-tempo love song featuring a synth-pop and new wave production. The song is composed in D major. It is written in common time, it moves at a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute, and it has a vocal range from the low note of F♯3 to the high note of C♯5. The song is written in the common verse-chorus form, featuring five instruments: bass guitar, drums, guitar, keyboards and synthesizer. "Cool" opens with all five instruments, and as Stefani begins singing, the synthesizer is lowered, and the hard-hitting drum beat steadily increases in volume. She performs her highest pitch (C♯5) during the chorus, after which she sings in a softer, almost sotto voce, and her lowest pitch (E3) at the beginning of the verses. The synthesizer emulates brass and woodwind instruments, while the bass and guitar retain a prominent and regular eighth note pulse, using a I–IV–V chord progression for the verses. In the percussion section a drum kit is used and the snare is introduced at the beginning of the first chorus, which maintains its beat. During the song's fade-out, Stefani repeats "I know we're cool" and "yeah", and she occasionally emphasizes "cool". Her vocal range covers close to two octaves. "Cool" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Jennifer Nine from Yahoo! Music referred to the song as "a liltingly sweet paean to post-break-up friendships", while Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called it a "high school anthem-in-waiting" theme; it also was selected as one of the album's highlights. Richard Smirke from Playlouder commented that the song successfully used the same production formula as fellow album tracks "Serious" and "What You Waiting For?", and described it as a "crisp blend of edgy 21C production and early 80s Madonna-esque pop". Jason Damas, in a review for PopMatters, characterized it as "a slippery slice of keyboard" New Wave song referring to it as a "pitched halfway between The Go-Go's and Cyndi Lauper". Eric Greenwood from Drawer B called "Cool" "a retrofitted [song] with stale synths and chugging guitars" with "dorkier lyrics than even Cyndi Lauper would dare". Sandy Cohen from the Toronto Star called it "the year's love anthem". Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne described Stefani in "Cool", and in another song from the album ("The Real Thing"), as "a glacial '80s synthpop zombie". Krissi Murison from NME found Stefani's performance reminiscent of "Madonna's breathless purr". John Murphy wrote for musicOMH that "Cool" would remind No Doubt fans of "Don't Speak".
