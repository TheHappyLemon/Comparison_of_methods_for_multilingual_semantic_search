Bad Cat (Turkish: Kötü Kedi Şerafettin) is a 2016 Turkish adult animated action comedy film directed by Mehmet Kurtuluş and Ayşe Ünal. The film is based on the comic strip Kötü Kedi Şerafettin by Bülent Üstün. It is a self-funded independent film, and some its profits originated from product placement. Bad Cat premiered on February 5, 2016, in Turkey and at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in 2016. The film was released on Tubi on April 20, 2023. A video game adaptation, titled The Bad Cat, was released on mobile devices shortly after the film's release. In an apartment in Istanbul, Shero, a crass and short-tempered tabby cat owned by a man named Tank, is seen smoking in the bathroom. He then sends his associates Rifki the seagull and Riza the rat, to obtain liquor for a barbecue that night. Another cat, Blackie, informs Shero of an attractive Siamese cat named Princess in a nearby apartment. When Princess's cartoonist owner leaves for work, Shero and Blackie sneak into the apartment to seduce her, but this leads to a series of accidents which results in Princess's death. The cartoonist returns home to find Princess dead and furiously attacks Shero and Blackie. Blackie is killed, and Shero engages the cartoonist in a fight that results in the cartoonist's death when they both tumble out the window. On his way back home, Shero meets a kitty named Taco, who claims to be Shero's illegitimate son. Shero rejects Taco and goes to steal some fish from Hazel, Tank's landlady. Hazel retaliates by threatening Tank with eviction unless he can cover months of unpaid rent by the next day. An angered Tank ejects Shero from his home and blocks every possible entrance. While smoking and sulking, Shero witnesses a beautiful Angora cat named Misscat being harassed by a pair of dogs and rescues her by beating her assailants. Shero attempts to seduce Misscat but is turned down and told to meet her again on the same rooftop that night. Meanwhile, the brainless cadaver of the cartoonist is revived by an ambulance defibrillator. The cartoonist hijacks the ambulance and begins a vengeful search for Shero. As Shero obtains a bouquet for Misscat, the cartoonist finds the two dogs and forces them to lead him to Shero; Taco, who was rummaging for food, witnesses this transaction and follows them. Shero and Misscat rendezvous and prepare to make love when they are captured and tied up by the dogs and the cartoonist. Before the cartoonist can electrocute Shero, Taco appears and frees Shero, who fights the cartoonist and throws him off the building and into a dumpster, along with the dogs. Taco is once again brushed off by Shero, and he reveals that his mother, a past mate of Shero's named Mimosa, is dead. Shero and Taco bond after a brief exchange of fists and Taco helps Shero attempt to obtain liquor from the local grocer. However, the cartoonist, having hijacked a passing garbage truck, absconds with Taco during the mission, forcing Shero into a chase. Shero rescues Taco as the garbage truck plunges into the sea, and Shero once more kills the cartoonist in an underwater fight. As Shero and Taco make their return home, Hazel chases off Misscat and installs barbed wire to further prevent Shero's entry. The cartoonist's body is lifted out of the sea by a rescue team, and he is once again revived when his body comes into contact with power wires. After Rifki and Riza's latest attempt to retrieve liquor ends in failure, Riza proposes to Shero that they can all get what they want by robbing a bank. The cartoonist is apprehended by the police, but he hijacks the police car when the bank's robbery is reported. As Shero and the group make their getaway, Taco takes a bullet for Shero from the cartoonist. Shero, believing Taco to be dead, discards the stolen money into a crowd of people in his grief, and he leaves with Taco's body in the confusion. Tank comes across Shero and Taco and takes them back home in the absence of available veterinarians. Tank and Shero successfully treat Taco's bullet wound and revive him, and Rifki and Riza return with a single pack of money from the robbery, which is used to clear all of Shero and Tank's debts. The last of the money is used to hold Shero's barbecue. The celebration is cut short by the arrival of the cartoonist, who has taken Misscat hostage. Shero and Tank engage in one last fight against the cartoonist and finally destroy him in a gas explosion. Shero and Misscat watch the fireworks and confess their love for each other. They then have sex, and end up bouncing across the world as the credits roll. Uğur Yücel (Don Battee in the English version) as Şerafettin / Shero, a yellow cat.
