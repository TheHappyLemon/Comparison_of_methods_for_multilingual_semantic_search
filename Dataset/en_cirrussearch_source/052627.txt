The men's team parallel bars was the first of eight gymnastics events on the Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics programme. It was held on 9 April. Three teams took part, one German and two Greek, with the German team winning the competition. This was the only appearance of the event, which was one of two team apparatus events contested at the 1896 Games (along with a team horizontal bar competition). There were 10 sets of parallel bars made available to the teams. However, there was apparently no limit on the size of the teams, as the Panellinios team had 33 members (though the names of only four are known). Judges scored the routines on execution, rhythm, and technical difficulty. The men's team parallel bars was held in the afternoon of the fourth day of events. It was the second event of the afternoon, following the 800 metres (which began at 2:30 p.m.). "Gymnastics at the 1896 Athina Summer Games: Men's Parallel Bars, Teams". Sports Reference.
