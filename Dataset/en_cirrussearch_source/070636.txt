Cotabato City, officially the City of Cotabato (Maguindanaon: Kuta nu Kutawatu, Jawi: كوت نو كوتوات‎; Cebuano: Dakbayan sa Cotabato; Filipino: Lungsod ng Cotabato), is a first class independent component city in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 325,079 people, making it as the most populated city under the independent component city status. Cotabato City was formerly a part and the regional center of Region XII, but due to the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, it is now part of Bangsamoro and serves as the regional center. Being an independent component city, it is not a subject to regulation from the Provincial Government of Maguindanao del Norte where it is geographically located. The Philippine Statistics Authority also lists Cotabato City as statistically independent. It was the capital of the Sultanate of Maguindanao. Cotabato City is distinct from and should not be confused with the province of Cotabato. Prior to the arrival of Hindus and Muslims, the city was a vast swamp and rainforest landscape where numerous ethno-linguistic groups lived. Maguindanao vernacular architecture developed during this era, which included the architectural techniques of at least 10 ethno-linguistic groups. Later on, Hindu traders arrived and the people of the area embraced the practice of Hinduism. The set of moral standards and culture of present-day people of Maguindanao are seen due to this Hindu influence. By 1515, after a successful Muslim establishment in Sulu, Muslim traders went to Maguindanao and converted many of the natives to Islam. Those that did not accept the arrival of the Muslims went into higher ground or the interior of the island and became the Teduray, as well as other lumad groups. During the same year, the Sultanate of Maguindanao was formally established, with Tubok as its initial capital. However, the sultan's seat would eventually be transferred in 1711 at around Tamontaka, a barangay within modern-day Cotabato. In 1861, Spain would eventually establish a garrison in Maguindanao and establish Kuta Watu, which was eventually renamed as Cotabato, as its new capital. The Spanish Empire had defeated the Sulu Sultanate in war and forced it to sign an unfavorable peace treaty in 1851. With the Moro Gulf and Illana Bay now open to Spanish traffic as a result of their victory over the Sulu Moros, this paved the way for the first steps for the conquest of the Maguindanao Sultanate several years later. To that end, Spanish Jesuit missionaries have already made their way as early as 1859 at Polloc where they earned several hundred converts, but the place was deemed unsuitable in account of its less than optimal ecology. And so the Spanish district governor of Mindanao based in Zamboanga requested Datu Amirul, the father of present Sultan of Maguindanao Muhammad Makakua, for them to establish a military base at the stone fortress at Kota Wato in what is now Barangay Tamontaka, and Datu Amirul gave the consent. The Spanish then established themselves at the said fort, raising the Spanish flag there and renamed it Cotabato, the Hispanized form of its name, on April 30, 1861. The Spanish and the Moro chiefs and locals then had a conference later the same day which stipulated the Maguindanaoan locals of Cotabato are now subjects of the Spanish Crown but their Islamic beliefs would be respected. Thus, on April 30, 1861, in the flood plains of Tamontaka, the town of Cotabato was officially born. Under the reign of Sultan Muhammad Makakua, who while being the nominal sultan of Maguindanao was at this point under complete Spanish vassalage, roads and wharves were built in Cotabato, specifically where the Tamontaka River was situated. Forests were felled and cleared by the new Catholic Tiruray converts of Tamontaka to make way for the expansion of the newly established town. In 1871, the capital of the Spanish military district of Mindanao was moved from Zamboanga to Cotabato, only to be moved back previously the next year when a destructive earthquake ravaged the town. Following the Spanish evacuation in Jan. 1899, Datu Piang led the Moro's in a massacre of the remaining Christian community, enslaving those they did not kill.: 529–530  Americans arrived in Mindanao in 1900 after the Spanish–American War ended in 1898. Cotabato town was part of Moro Province and of Department of Mindanao and Sulu from 1903 to 1920, when the Empire Province of Cotabato,[disputed – discuss] referred to as "Moroland" by the Americans, was founded with the town as the capital, with Datu Piang as its first governor. Several towns were carved off from Cotabato town since the year 1913, with Pikit being the first one founded by Cebuano Christian colonists. Dulawan (now Datu Piang, Maguindanao) and Midsayap were incorporated as regular municipalities in 1936. In 1942, at the beginning of the Pacific Front of World War II, the Japanese Imperial forces entered what is now Maguindanao province. In 1945, Maguindanao was liberated by allied Philippine Commonwealth troops and Muslim Maguindanaoan guerrilla units after defeating the Japanese Imperial forces in the Battle of Maguindanao during the Second World War. On August 18, 1947, just two years after the Second World War and a year after the official inauguration of Philippine independence, the number of towns in the gigantic Cotabato province were multiplied by Executive Order No. 82 signed by President Manuel Roxas, namely: Kidapawan, Pagalungan, Buayan, Marbel, Parang, Nuling, Dinaig, Salaman, Buluan, Kiamba, and Cabacan, a total of eleven (11) towns added to the previous four towns; the newly founded towns of Kabuntalan, Pikit (conversion as regular municipality), and Glan added up on September 30, 1949. More and more newly created towns added up in the province's number of towns as the province entered the second half of the 20th century. The city was chartered by the virtue of Republic Act No. 2364 on June 20, 1959. The city used to be part of the original Province of Cotabato and was its capital from 1920 until 1967, a year after the separation of South Cotabato; since then the city was the administrative center of the ARMM when Maguindanao was carved out in 1973. On December 22, 1979, along with Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan, Pasay, Batangas City, Lipa, Iloilo City, and other cities in the country, Cotabato became a highly urbanized city. However, the city broke off administratively from Maguindanao as it rejoined Soccsksargen in the 1990s. Now many sources consider the city as part of the present Cotabato province, although geographically it is still considered part of Maguindanao. The city has traditionally resisted efforts for its inclusion to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao despite serving as the government center of the region. Despite this, the city's residents voted for their locality's inclusion in the new Bangsamoro Autonomous Region by voting to ratify the Bangsamoro Organic Law in the January 21, 2019 plebiscite. The city became de jure part of Bangsamoro following the plebiscite, as well as the government center of the new region. It became official part of the region after its formal turnover to the Bangsamoro regional government on December 15, 2020. Cotabato is approximately 698.9 nautical miles (1,294.4 kilometres) from Manila, the country's capital, and is bounded by the municipalities of Sultan Kudarat to the north—with Rio Grande de Mindanao/Pulangi River separating the two—Kabuntalan to the east, and Datu Odin Sinsuat to the south. The city faces Illana Bay, part of the Moro Gulf, to the west. Cotabato City has a total land area of 176.0 square kilometres (68.0 sq mi), located at the mouth of the Rio Grande de Mindanao and Pulangi River. Cotabato City has 27 urban barangays that are grouped into two major urban areas, the Down Town Area and the Upper Town Area. Down Town Area The Downtown Area encompasses the barangays of Poblacion and Bagua, with a population exceeding 150,000. Situated below sea level, it faces constant flooding risks. Serving as Cotabato City's central hub for banking, trading, and commerce, it hosts over 20 banks and major wet markets like Mega Market and City Arcade. Additionally, prominent malls and supermarkets such as South Seas Mall, Puregold Main Branch, Sugni Super Store, and Superama (with 3 branches) are situated here, along with the upcoming KCC Mall of Cotabato. Notable educational institutions include Notre Dame University, Cotabato City Central Pilot School (the largest elementary school), STI Cotabato, and Notre Dame of Cotabato. Upper Town Area The Upper Town Area, situated in the elevated regions of Cotabato City, encompasses all barangays of Rosary Heights and is home to the Peoples Palace (City Hall). Serving as the service center of Cotabato City, it houses Regional Government Agencies from both the Bangsamoro Region and Region 12. Additionally, it is home to Cotabato Regional and Medical Center, along with other medical facilities. Educational institutions in this area include Cotabato State University, Notre Dame-RVM, and AMA Computer College, as well as the now-closed University of Mindanao. Major shopping destinations include CityMall, Mall of Alnor, and Fiesta Mall (Puregold's second branch), while numerous restaurants populate the area, including Jollibee (two branches), Chowking (two branches), Mang Inasal, Greenwich, Chicken Deli, Gerry's Grill, Hukad Restaurant, Bo's Coffee (two branches), Blackscoop Cafe, Highlands Coffee, and Penongs. Two other emerging areas include Barangays of Kalanganan, where the Seaport and Grand Mosque are situated. The primary industry here revolves around aquaculture, with proposed developments for a Public Market and Public Terminal. Additionally, construction of a coastal road is underway in this area. Another burgeoning area is the Barangays of Tamontaka, slated for the establishment of an International Airport. Tamontaka also serves as the eastern diversion road of Cotabato City. The city is situated in the lowest portion of Maguindanao province. The City of Cotabato with its 37 barangays spans an area with marked landscapes of flat, level to nearly level, very gently sloping to gently undulations to moderately sloping or rolling. It is basically a delta formed by two big rivers, the Tamontaka River and the Rio Grande de Mindanao. Basically 70% of its total land area is below sea level. There are only 2 existing elevated areas in the city, the PC Hill and the Timako Hill with an altitude of 90 and 150 feet, respectively. At the foot of PC Hill is Tantawan Park and also hosts the Kutang Bato Caves. Concentration of settlements and other urban uses are in the central portion while the southwestern and southeastern portion have mixed uses of agricultural land settlements. The city is criss-crossed by meandering and braided creeks and rivers like the Matampay, Parang, Timako, Esteros and Miwaruy. These water bodies serve as sources of both agricultural, industrial and domestic water requirements of some rural barangays. These rivers also serve as the natural drainage flow of the city's wastes. Cotabato City is politically subdivided into 37 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios. Currently, there are 27 urban barangays as classified by Philippine Statistics Authority (highlighted in bold).

There are sizable ethnic populations of Cebuanos (14%), Tagalogs (9.7%), Iranuns (7%), Hiligaynons (5.6%), Bisaya (2.7%) and Chinese (2%). The remainder of the population belongs to other ethnicities (e.g. Tausug, Teduray, Ilocano, Maranao and Indian). Maguindanaon is widely understood and spoken in Cotabato City, being the native language of the Maguindanaon and some other ethnicities in the city could also speak and understand it. The related Danao languages of Iranun and Maranao are spoken by residents of the corresponding ethnicities. Other Moro languages such as Tausug, Sama and Yakan are also spoken in the city. The main lingua franca is Tagalog, making Cotabato City the "Tagalog-speaking city of Mindanao". English, as the country's other official language, is also spoken and heard often around the city, sometimes mixed with Tagalog (known as Taglish) or with any of the other languages spoken in the city. Chavacano, Ilonggo, Ilocano and Cebuano are spoken as well by the various Christian minorities of the city. Chavacano has its own dialect in the city called Cotabateño, but it was replaced by Tagalog as the lingua franca, which reduced the number of native Chavacano speakers. Classical Arabic is often heard at mosques and madrasas as the sacred language of Islam. As reported by Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) on 2015, 76.15% of the people of Cotabato City are adherents of Sunni Islam.
