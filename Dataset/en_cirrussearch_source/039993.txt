The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature is a 2017 animated comedy film directed by Cal Brunker and written by Brunker, Bob Barlen, and Scott Bindley. The sequel to The Nut Job (2014) and based on the characters created by Peter Lepeniotis, it stars the voices of Will Arnett, Maya Rudolph, Jackie Chan, Katherine Heigl, Bobby Moynihan, Bobby Cannavale, Isabela Moner, Jeff Dunham, and Gabriel Iglesias. The film is an American-Canadian-South Korean co-production, produced by Gulfstream Pictures, Redrover International and ToonBox Entertainment, and distributed by Open Road Films in the United States and The Weinstein Company in international. The story follows Surly Squirrel and his animal friends as they find out that Percival J. Muldoon, the unscrupulous Mayor of Oakton City, plans to bulldoze Liberty Park to make way for an amusement park named Libertyland. They must join forces with Mr. Feng and his mice to save Liberty Park and defeat the mayor. Following the commercial success of its predecessor, Open Road announced a sequel in January 2014, with a planned January 15, 2016 release date before being pushed back to a May 2017 release and finally August 2017 release. Brunker replaced Lepeniotis as a director, while Brunker, Barlen, and Bindley were brought on board to write the film. Arnett, Rudolph, and the rest of the cast reprised their voice roles, with new additions to the cast including Chan, Moynihan, Cannavale and Stormare. The musical score was composed by Heitor Pereira, replacing Paul Intson from the first film. The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature was released theatrically on August 11, 2017. Like its predecessor, the film was met with negative reviews and grossed less with $68.7 million against a budget of $40 million. Since Norvirus Raccoon's defeat, Surly Squirrel is now loved by Liberty Park's urban wildlife community, who oversees an all-you-can-eat buffet at Maury's Nut Shop (now renamed Nibbler's Nut Shop), but this worries Andie as she has a more hard-working outlook on life than Surly. Mole accidentally blows up the nut shop after he forgets to reduce pressure from the boiler. Andie suggests returning to their roots by foraging for food in Liberty Park as Surly and Buddy fail to find other food-packed places. Defeated, he and Buddy return to the park. Concerned that Liberty Park never makes money, Percival J. Muldoon, the unscrupulous Mayor of Oakton City, decides to turn it into an amusement park named Libertyland. Surly and Andie discover Muldoon's plot, and Surly convinces the animals to sabotage the construction workers' efforts to tear down the park. Surly's enjoyment is short-lived. Andie attempts to convince the animals to work hard for food, which Surly believes can result in disappointment. When the construction workers' foreman tells Muldoon about the animal attacks, he calls an animal extermination squad led by Gunther. Surly becomes caught in one of Gunther's traps and the animals are pursued by Muldoon's dog Frankie who later falls in love with Precious. Surly and Buddy leave to rescue her while the others find a new park. While searching for Muldoon's car, Surly and Buddy run afoul of a colony of territorial white mice led by Mr. Feng. They evade the mice and find Muldoon's mansion where they find Precious in the bedroom of Muldoon's bratty daughter Heather. Precious tells Frankie she is uninterested in him, breaking his heart. Surly's recklessness causes Muldoon to shoot Buddy who falls off a balcony and falls unconscious. Andie, Jimmy, Johnny, and Jamie find what seems to be a suitable park, but it turns out to be a golf course that almost gets them killed. The Bruisers have multiple injuries while Andie had to resuscitate Jamie with CPR and even defibrillation with some wires. Surly, Precious, and Buddy reunite with the others in the nut shop's remains. While mourning Buddy, Surly recounts how they saved each other as kids. Buddy wakes up after Precious licks him. Surly leads the animals in retaking the park from Muldoon during Libertyland's grand opening. Muldoon calls Gunther and his team over to capture them. Surly, the only one left standing, goes to Mr. Feng and his army. While attacking Surly, the latter convinces Feng the animals must work together regardless of whether they are from the city or a park. Surly and the mice free the other animals and round them up to take back Liberty Park. They overwhelm the humans, destroy all of the rides, and attract the attention of the police. Precious finds Frankie, apologizes, and confesses she does care for him, causing Frankie to fall in love with her again. After the pair make up, Heather tries to convince Gunther to tranquilize them. But due to the interference of Surly, Andie, and Buddy, Gunther shoots Heather, knocking her out while he runs away. Muldoon tries to escape the chaos using a hot air balloon, but Surly and Buddy commandeer a roller coaster to catch up to him. Surly makes it on top of the balloon and he and Muldoon engage in a long battle. Muldoon falls on top of a bouncy house and is attacked by Feng and his colony. Muldoon, Heather, and Gunther are arrested for their crimes and Libertyland is shut down for good. Several months later, the people help rebuild Liberty Park to its former glory. After the park is rebuilt, Feng and his colony stay and focus on Tai Chi, Precious and Frankie have puppies, and Surly takes Andie on a ride with Precious to rob a nut cart.

In the United States and Canada, The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature was released alongside Annabelle: Creation and The Glass Castle, and was initially projected to gross $12–14 million from 4,003 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after making just $3 million on its first day (including $330,000 from Thursday previews), expectations were lowered to $8–9 million. It went on to open to $8.3 million, finishing 3rd at the box office and down 68% from the first film's $25.7 million 4-day opening.

The site's critical consensus reads, "The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature may be a slight improvement over its predecessor, but its frantic animated antics still offer minimal entertainment to all but the least discriminating viewers." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 36 out of 100 based on 19 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, an improvement over the first film's "B". Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: "As an animated entertainment, The Nut Job 2 lacks several key factors: memorable characters, a fun story, jokes that will appeal to adults as well as little kids. But one thing it does not lack is visual momentum." Maya Rudolph was nominated for Outstanding Voice Performance at the 2018 Black Reel Awards. Dave McNary (2014-01-23).
