The latest census in 2016 showed a population of 373,416 people in 109,231 households. Khorramabad is in the Zagros Mountains. Khorramabad Airport is 3 km south of the city proper. Although not a major tourist destination, it is quite scenic and possesses several attractions, such as five Paleolithic cave-dwelling sites. The city population is predominantly Lur and the largest Luri-speaking city in the country. The linguistic composition of the city: The founder of the Hazaraspid dynasty was Abu Tahir ibn Muhammad, a descendant of the Shabankara chieftain Fadluya. Fadluya was initially a commander of the Salghurids of Fars and was appointed governor of Kuhgiluya, but eventually gained independence in Luristan and extended his realm as far as Isfahan. During the reign of the Safavid dynasty, Khorramabad was the administrative center of Luristan Province. In the wake of the demise of the Safavids, after the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople (1724) with Imperial Russia, the Ottomans conquered Khorramabad on the 6th of September 1725. Brick Minaret is a cylindrical brick tower from Seljuq and Buyid dynasties located inside the ancient city of Shapur khast, south of Khorramabad. This Iranian minaret is a combination of the Indian Stupa, commemorative columns, and the central Asia tradition of tower building for defensive and communication purposes.
