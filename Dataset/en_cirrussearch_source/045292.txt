Pärnu Rannastaadion (English: Pärnu Beach Stadium) is a multi-purpose stadium in Pärnu, Estonia. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Pärnu JK Vaprus and PJK. The stadium was opened after reconstruction in 2016 and seats 1,501. The address of the stadium is Ranna pst. 2, 80012 Pärnu. Although sporting activities on the field, where today lies Pärnu Rannastaadion, date back to 1896, when a velodrome was opened by the association of German cyclists, the stadium was officially opened on 14 July 1929. The grandstand, which was also built to host singing festivals, was able to seat around 700 people and was labelled as 'the finest of the Baltic states'. However, on 9 February 1933 the grandstand was set on fire and the perpetrators were never caught. 6 months later, a new and larger grandstand was opened. The stadium survived World War II and hosted numerous post-war singing festivals, before undergoing renovation in the 1980s. After Estonia regained its independence in 1991, Pärnu Stadium was left in a particularly bad condition. After years of discussions, the stadium underwent renovation in 2015 and was reopened on 9 July 2016. The new stadium complex also facilitates a hostel, gym, seminar rooms and a restaurant. On 31 August 2016, Pärnu Rannastaadion hosted The Estonian national football team's friendly match against Malta. Since 2018, the stadium has also been regularly used as a home venue by the Estonia U21 national team. From 2021, Pärnu has also hosted numerous UEFA Europa Conference League qualifying matches of Paide Linnameeskond. 1929–1933 1933–1981 2016–present The condition of the stadium in 2007 Pärnu Rannastaadion in 2016 Pärnu Rannastaadion in 2016 Pärnu Rannastaadion with surroundings in 2016 Pärnu has hosted four Estonia national football team matches.
