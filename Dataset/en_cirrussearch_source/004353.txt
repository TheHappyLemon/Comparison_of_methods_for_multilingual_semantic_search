Centre-Val de Loire (/ˌvæl də ˈlwɑːr/, /ˌvɑːl-/, French pronunciation: [sɑ̃tʁə val də lwaʁ], lit. 'Centre-Loire Valley') or Centre Region (French: région Centre, [ʁeʒjɔ̃ sɑ̃tʁ]), as it was known until 2015, is one of the eighteen administrative regions of France. It straddles the middle Loire Valley in the interior of the country, with a population of 2,572,853 as of 2018. Its prefecture is Orléans, and its largest city is Tours. Like many contemporary regions of France, the region of Centre-Val de Loire was created from parts of historical provinces: Touraine, Orléanais and Berry. First, the name Centre was chosen by the government purely on the basis of geography, in reference to its location in northwest-central France (the central part of the original French language area). However, Centre is not situated in the geographical centre of France (except the Cher department); the name was criticised as being too dull and nondescript.[citation needed] Proposed names for the region included Val de Loire after the Loire Valley (the main feature of the region) or Cœur de Loire (Heart of Loire).[citation needed] On 17 January 2015, as part of the reorganisation of French regions, the region's official name was changed to Centre-Val de Loire. Val de Loire is associated with positive images of the Loire Valley, such as the châteaux, the gentle and refined lifestyle, wine, as well as the mild and temperate climate, all of which attract many tourists to the region. A new logo was also created. Bordering six other regions, Centre-Val-de-Loire borders the most of all eighteen regions in France. The bordering regions are Normandy on the northwest, Île-de-France on the northeast, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté on the east, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes on the southeast, Nouvelle-Aquitaine on the southwest and Pays de la Loire on the west. Centre-Val de Loire comprises six departments: Cher, Eure-et-Loir, Indre, Indre-et-Loire, Loir-et-Cher, and Loiret.
