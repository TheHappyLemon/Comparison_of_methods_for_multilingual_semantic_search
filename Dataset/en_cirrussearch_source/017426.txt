Kosmos 2482 (Russian: Космос 2482 meaning Cosmos 2482) is a Russian military store-dump communications satellite launched in 2013, together with Kosmos 2483 and Kosmos 2484. This satellite is a Strela-3M/Rodnik satellite, a modification of the civilian Gonets satellites. Kosmos 2482 was launched from site 133/3 at Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia. A rokot carrier rocket with a Briz-KM upper stage was used to perform the launch which took place at 16:24 UTC on 15 January 2013. The launch successfully placed the satellite into low Earth orbit. It subsequently received its Kosmos designation, and the international designator 2013-001A. The United States Space Command assigned it the Satellite Catalog Number 39057. The launch was postponed from 8 December 2012 and was the first launch of a Rokot since the 28 July 2012 launch of Kosmos 2481, another Rodnik.
