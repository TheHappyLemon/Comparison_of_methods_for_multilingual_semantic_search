Kosmos 496 (Russian: Космос 496 meaning Cosmos 496) was an unmanned test of the redesigned Soyuz ferry. The redesign may have involved changes to the Salyut/Soyuz hatch. It did not dock with any space station. After the Soyuz 11 disaster the third seat was removed because the space was needed for the two crewmen in space suits and their equipment. Kosmos 496 retained its solar arrays. Spacecraft: Soyuz-7K-T Mass: 6800 kg Crew: None Launched: June 26, 1972. Launch site: Baikonur. Orbit 195 x 343km. Inclination 51 degrees.
