Dario Šits (born 4 February 2004) is a Latvian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Serie C Group B club SPAL on loan from Parma, and the Latvian under-21 national team. Born in Kuldīga, Šits started playing football at FK Metta, before joining Italian side Parma in 2020. Following his performances for the Under-17 and Primavera teams, the forward earned his first call-ups to the club's first team during the 2021–22 season, under head coach Giuseppe Iachini. On 2 March 2022, Šits made his professional debut for Parma, starting in a 1–1 Serie B draw against AC Monza. On 11 March, shortly after coming on as a substitute in a league match against Cittadella, the forward earned a penalty kick for his side, which was then missed by Juan Brunetta: the fixture ended in a 1–1 draw. On 6 October of the same year, Šits extended his contract with Parma until 2026. On 24 August 2023, Šits joined Serie C club SPAL on a season-long loan, with an option to buy in favor of the club and a buy-back clause in favor of Parma. He made his debut for the club on 2 September, starting in a 1–0 league win over Vis Pesaro: however, he suffered an ACL injury in the same game, thus being forced to enter long-term convalescence. Šits has represented Latvia at various youth international levels, having played for the under-17, under-19 and under-21 national teams. Šits is a centre-forward, who has been praised mainly for his technical and physical abilities, as well as his speed, his work rate and his finishing. Mainly a right-footed player, he is also capable of using his left foot. As of match played 2 September 2023 Dario Šits at Soccerway. Retrieved 16 March 2022.
