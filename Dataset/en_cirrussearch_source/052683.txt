Formerly, it was called Bina International Airport after a suburb of the Azerbaijan capital Baku. On 10 March 2004, the airport was renamed after the former president of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev. The airport is 20 kilometers northeast of Baku, connected to the city by a highway. It serves as the hub for national carrier Azerbaijan Airlines as well as for Azal Avia Cargo, Buta Airways and Silk Way West Airlines.
