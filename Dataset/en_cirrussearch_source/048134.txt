Štefanek was the first Serbian athlete to win a medal in Rio de Janeiro after 11 days of disappointing results and was credited by other Serbian athletes for raising their spirits. The Serbian team then proceeded to win 7 more medals in the following days, making the 2016 Olympic Games edition by far the most successful in Serbia's history as an independent nation until that point.
