Norman Mark Reedus (born January 6, 1969) is an American actor and former fashion model. He made his acting debut in the 1990s, starring in the role of Murphy MacManus in The Boondock Saints, followed by supporting roles in successful box office films 8MM, Blade II, and American Gangster. Reedus rose to prominence for his portrayal of Daryl Dixon in the hit AMC horror drama series The Walking Dead (2010–2022). Regarded as one of the show's most popular characters, he has starred in his own spin-off series, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, since 2023. Reedus is the host of the AMC show Ride with Norman Reedus (2016–present). He has modeled for various fashion designers, including Prada. Reedus also landed roles in the television series Law & Order and Hawaii Five-O and ventured into voice acting, appearing in video games and voicing Sam Porter in the video game Death Stranding and Striker in the animated series Helluva Boss. He has also starred in music videos for Lady Gaga, Keith Richards, Radiohead, R.E.M., and Orville Peck. Reedus was born in Hollywood, Florida, the son of Marianne (née Yarber), a teacher, and Ira Norman Reedus. Reedus's paternal grandmother was of Italian and French descent, while his grandfather had English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry.[better source needed] His parents divorced when he was young. Reedus attended Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas, for a semester. After living in Tokyo, he moved to California to work at a Harley-Davidson shop in Venice, California, and contributed artwork to various shows as a painter, photographer, sculptor, and video artist. He first acted in the play Maps for Drowners at the Tiffany Theater on Sunset Boulevard. Reedus played Jeremy in his major film debut Mimic and Mac in Giovanni Rodriguez's Red Canyon. He played Murphy MacManus in the 1999 film The Boondock Saints. He reprised the role in the 2009 sequel The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day. He played Scud in Blade II. He guest-starred in Charmed as Nate, the boyfriend of Paige (Rose McGowan). Reedus starred in Hello Herman, which opened nationwide and on-demand on June 7, 2013. Reedus stars in the reality series Ride with Norman Reedus, which premiered in June 2016. Most recently, he started Bigbaldhead Productions with an overall deal at AMC. In 2010, Reedus began playing Daryl Dixon in the AMC television series The Walking Dead, a horror drama about a group of friends and family members who fight to survive in a violent apocalyptic world populated with flesh-eating zombies and the few surviving humans. The character was not originally in the comic book series of the same name, but was created specifically for Reedus after his audition for the character of Merle Dixon. The Walking Dead comic creator Robert Kirkman feels "absolutely blessed Reedus has honored the show with his presence, and the way he has come in and taken over that role and defined Daryl Dixon. A lot of Reedus's portrayal of the character in the first season inspired all the writers to do what we did with him in the second season. We love writing him and end up doing cool stuff with him." The drama has evolved into the highest-rated in cable history, smashing all previous records. Reedus was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Reedus reprised his role of Daryl as the lead of a spin-off series centered on his character, following the conclusion of the 11th and final season of The Walking Dead. Angela Kang is the showrunner for the series, which debuted in September 2023. In March 2024, Thunder Road Films, Dragonfly Films and Impossible Dream Entertainment announced a "reimagining" of The Boondock Saints, with Reedus and co-star Sean Patrick Flanery reprising their roles from the first two films and serving as executive producers, although Troy Duffy would not return as director for the third film; instead he plans to write a series of novels. Reedus has modeled for Prada, Yohji Yamamoto, Alessandro Dell'Acqua, Durban, Levi's, Lexus, and Morgenthal Fredrics.[citation needed] In 2015, Reedus posed for a Cruelty Free International advertisement in support of ending cosmetic tests on animals. In the mid-1990s, while working as a model, Reedus appeared in the music videos for "Wicked as It Seems" by Keith Richards, "Violently Happy" by Björk, "Flat Top" by Goo Goo Dolls, "Cat's in the Cradle" covered by Ugly Kid Joe, "Strange Currencies" by R.E.M., and "Fake Plastic Trees" by Radiohead. In 1999, he appeared in the video for "Mean to Me" by Tonic. Since achieving fame as an actor, he has also appeared in the videos for "Judas" by Lady Gaga, "Sun Down" by Tricky (feat. Tirzah), "Gypsy Woman" by Hilary Duff, "No Cities to Love" by Sleater-Kinney, and "Curse of the Blackened Eye" by Orville Peck. Reedus is also a painter, sculptor, and photographer who has shown his artwork in galleries in New York City, Barcelona, Berlin, and Frankfurt. He released a book of photography on October 31, 2013, called The Sun's Coming Up... Like a Big Bald Head. In September 2014, Reedus announced a fan-art compilation called Thanks for All the Niceness. Reedus reprised his role as Daryl Dixon in the 2013 video game The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct, which is based on the television series. He was set to star in Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro's reboot horror game Silent Hills, but Kojima left Konami and the game was canceled in 2015. Reedus starred in Kojima's video game Death Stranding, released in 2019. Reedus reprised his role in the game's sequel, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach.

They have remained friends and shared joint custody of their son. In February 2005, Reedus sustained a head injury when a truck collided with his car in Germany. His nose was reconstructed with the aid of four screws and his left eye socket with titanium.
