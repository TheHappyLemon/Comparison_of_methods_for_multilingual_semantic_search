Kim Yong-sik (Korean: 김용식; Hanja: 金容植; 25 July 1910 – 8 March 1985) was a South Korean football player and manager. He is esteemed as the godfather of the South Korean football. Kim played international football for both Japan and South Korea. When Korea was ruled by Japan, Kim was the only Korean footballer called up to the Japan national team for the Summer Olympics. He contributed to Japan's victory by assisting the winning goal in the first round of the 1936 Summer Olympics against Sweden. After the Olympics, Kim joined Waseda University which had many Japan's national players, but he went back to Korea because of the discrimination about Koreans. Kim could participate in the Olympics as a Korean player after the end of the Japanese occupation. He achieved the first-ever victory of South Korean football against Mexico as a player-coach in the 1948 Summer Olympics. Kim had a fast pace, elaborate techniques, and high work capacity that most footballers need. Japan could not ignore his abilities; he was called up to the Japan national team. He played as a centre-half, but he was a playmaker who took part in the attack. Kim managed South Korean national team in the 1954 FIFA World Cup and the 1960 AFC Asian Cup after his retirement. Kim was diligent and only absorbed in the football. He extremely avoided harmful things to human body, and had ardor for training. His healthy habit made him continue his playing career until the age of forty.
