Nokia E90 Communicator is a high-end 3G mobile phone from Nokia, the fifth generation and final Communicator, also part of the Eseries. It was announced on 11 February 2007 at the 3GSM show in Barcelona. It succeeded the Nokia 9500 Communicator as the company's flagship business-oriented device. Its clamshell form and design are reminiscent of older palmtop computers. Unlike its predecessors, the E90 runs on the S60 platform of Symbian OS (3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 and v9.2 respectively). Previous Communicators meanwhile have been based on either GeOS or Symbian-based Series 80. The move to the common S60 was essential for software compatibility, but it did get rid of some exclusive Series 80 UI behaviours. The E90 is also the first Communicator to have UMTS/HSDPA connectivity and integrated GPS. It features OSGi and eRCP, Eclipse RCP for embedded systems. The first Nokia E90 unit was sold in an auction in Jakarta, Indonesia on 17 May 2007 for Rp. 45,000,000 (5,000 US$). Indonesia being one of the largest market share for Nokia's communicator series is cited as a reason for the unit's first launch location. Early user-feedback and reviews highlighted a defect in the microphone of the Communicator. Nokia initially denied the existence of the defect, but Nokia Europe later acknowledged it in the Q3 earnings report released on 18 October 2007, and stated that the issue had been fully resolved. The replacement of the QWERTY-ridden interface of Series 80 with the S60 software, which is designed to be used with one thumb, was criticised by some people. The Communicator's firmware version 7.40.1.2, released in late October 2007, added support for A-GPS and improved GPS performance. This version also upgraded the Maps application. As of June 2009[update], the Communicator's most recent firmware version is 400.34.93. The free navigation program Ovi Maps is also available for this Communicator (currently just without the free navigation itself).
