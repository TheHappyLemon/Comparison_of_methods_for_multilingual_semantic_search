Sergio Giavanni Kitchens (born June 14, 1993), known professionally as Gunna, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. He is signed to Young Thug's YSL Records and 300 Entertainment. Gunna initially rose to fame with the mixtape Drip Season 3 in 2018. Later that year, he released the mixtape Drip Harder with Lil Baby, which spawned the single "Drip Too Hard" that reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and eventually achieved Diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Gunna released his debut studio album, Drip or Drown 2, in 2019 and followed it up with his second studio album Wunna in 2020, which debuted atop the Billboard 200. In August 2020, he was featured on Internet Money's single "Lemonade" which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped multiple charts worldwide. His third album DS4Ever was released in 2022, becoming his second consecutive number-one album. On May 11, 2022, Gunna was arrested two days after alleged co-conspirator Young Thug in a 56-count RICO indictment against the YSL record label. On December 14, 2022, Gunna took a plea deal and was released from prison. Five months following his release, he released his fourth album, A Gift & a Curse (2023). The album contained his first top-ten solo single, "FukUMean". Gunna was born in College Park, Georgia. He was raised by his mother and has four older brothers. He started making music at age fifteen. He grew up listening to Cam'ron, Chingy and Outkast, among others. Gunna attended North Springs Charter School of Arts and Sciences, Langston Hughes High School and Creekside High School (Georgia) with Playboi Carti and Jason Olivas. 2013, Gunna released the mixtape Hard Body under the name Yung Serg. Gunna was introduced to fellow rapper Young Thug through Keith "King" Troup, a mutual friend and community figure who died in December 2015. He was later featured alongside rappers Travis Scott and Gucci Mane on Thug's song, "Floyd Mayweather", from his commercial mixtape Jeffery. On October 14, 2016, Gunna released his debut mixtape Drip Season through YSL Records. It featured members from YSL, such as Young Thug, Lil Duke, and Nechie.

Five months after his release from prison, Gunna released the track "Bread & Butter", in which he speaks on his arrest and allegations that he snitched on the YSL gang. On his 30th birthday, Gunna announced a new album titled A Gift & A Curse, which released a day later. In February 2022, Gunna teamed up with sustainable food waste management and hunger relief company Goodr to open a free grocery store at Ronald E.
