In addition, "between 1968 and 1970 he worked in partnership with Albert Szabo (Sołtan and Szabo)...with whom he designed several houses in New Hampshire and Massachusetts." His teaching was first recognized by the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture when he received the ACSA Distinguished Professor Award in 1986–87.
