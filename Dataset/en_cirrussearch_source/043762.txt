Mewa Arena (German pronunciation: [ˈmeːvaː ʔaˌʁeːnaː]; stylised as MEWA ARENA; also known as the 1. FSV Mainz 05 Arena due to UEFA sponsorship regulations) is a multi-purpose stadium in Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, that opened in July 2011. It is used for football matches, and hosts the home matches of the German Bundesliga side Mainz 05. The stadium has a capacity of 34,034, 19,700 seated, and replaced the Bruchwegstadion. The stadium was originally named Coface Arena ([ˈkoːfas ʔaˌʁeːna]) after a sponsorship deal with COFACE. From May 2016 to June 2021 the stadium was known as Opel Arena ([ˈoːpl̩ ʔaˌʁeːnaː]) per a naming rights agreement with Opel. The stadium adopted its current name in July 2021 following a sponsorship agreement with the MEWA Textil-Service, a German linen rental company. To celebrate the opening, FSV Mainz 05 hosted the Ligatotal! Cup 2011, a pre-season tournament with champions Borussia Dortmund, Hamburger SV and Bayern Munich. Borussia Dortmund won the tournament with FSV Mainz 05 finishing last after losing to Bayern Munich in the third-place play-off. The first league goal scored in the new arena was scored by Tunisian International Sami Allagui for FSV Mainz 05 against Bayer Leverkusen on 7 August 2011.
