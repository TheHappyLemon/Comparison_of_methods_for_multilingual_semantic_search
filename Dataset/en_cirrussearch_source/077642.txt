Normunds Sējējs (born February 16, 1968, in Riga) is a former Latvian ice hockey defenceman and coach. Sējējs was the general manager of Dinamo Riga in the Kontinental Hockey League. His twin sons Nauris and Nils are also professional hockey players. Sējējs began his professional ice hockey player career in 1987, when he helped his team Dinamo Riga to win the Soviet Championship League silver medal. Normunds played for Dinamo until the end of 1990-91, but in 1991-92 he continued to play for Stars Riga, which was a direct successor of Dinamo. In 1992 the club was renamed once again to HK Pardaugava Riga, but it continued to play in International Hockey League. Normunds played for the club also in 1993-94, but as the club faced some financial difficulties and was not capable of paying wages on time, the Latvian defenceman began searching for career opportunities outside Latvia.
