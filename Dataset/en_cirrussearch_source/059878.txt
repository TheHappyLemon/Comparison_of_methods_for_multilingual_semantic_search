Hoya serpens is a small trailing vine found in the Himalayas and surrounding areas. It has small round leaves that are 1.5 to 2 cm long. The leaves are dark green, hairy, and have grey spots intermittently dispersed. The flowers produced are extremely fuzzy with a light green corolla and a white corona with a bit of pink towards the center of the flower, with finally a yellow center. The flowers last about a week, and unlike other Hoyas, produce very little nectar. Additionally, the flowers produce a sweet fragrance. It was first discovered and published by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1883. FLORA OF BRITISH INDIA Vol. 4 p. 55, J. D. Hooker, (1883) v t e
