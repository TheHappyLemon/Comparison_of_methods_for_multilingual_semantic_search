45 (forty-five) is the natural number following 44 and preceding 46. Forty-five is the smallest odd number that has more divisors than n+1{\displaystyle n+1}, and that has a larger sum of divisors than n+1{\displaystyle n+1}. It is the sixth positive integer with a square-prime prime factorization of the form p2q{\displaystyle p^{2}q}, with p{\displaystyle p} and q{\displaystyle q} prime. 45 has an aliquot sum of 33 that is part of an aliquot sequence composed of five composite numbers (45, 33, 15, 9, 4, 3, 1, and 0), all of which are rooted in the 3-aliquot tree. This is the longest aliquot sequence for an odd number up to 45. Forty-five is the sum of all single-digit decimal digits: 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45{\displaystyle 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45}. It is, equivalently, the ninth triangle number. Forty-five is also the fourth hexagonal number and the second hexadecagonal number, or 16-gonal number. It is also the second smallest triangle number (after 1 and 10) that can be written as the sum of two squares. Forty-five is the smallest positive number that can be expressed as the difference of two nonzero squares in more than two ways: 72−22{\displaystyle 7^{2}-2^{2}}, 92−62{\displaystyle 9^{2}-6^{2}} or 232−222{\displaystyle 23^{2}-22^{2}} (see image). Since the greatest prime factor of 452+1=2026{\displaystyle 45^{2}+1=2026} is 1,013, which is much more than 45 twice, 45 is a Størmer number. In decimal, 45 is a Kaprekar number and a Harshad number. Forty-five is a little Schroeder number; the next such number is 197, which is the 45th prime number. Forty-five is conjectured from Ramsey number R(5,5){\displaystyle R(5,5)}. ϕ(45)=ϕ(σ(45)){\displaystyle \phi (45)=\phi (\sigma (45))} In the classification of finite simple groups, the Tits group T{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } is sometimes defined as a nonstrict group of Lie type or sporadic group, which yields a total of 45 classes of finite simple groups: two stem from cyclic and alternating groups, sixteen are families of groups of Lie type, twenty-six are strictly sporadic, and one is the exceptional case of T{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} }.
