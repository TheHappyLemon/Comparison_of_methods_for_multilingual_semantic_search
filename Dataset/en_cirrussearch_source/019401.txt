She represented Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö with the song "Gravity", placing third. Ognevich previously attempted to represent Ukraine at the contest in 2010 and 2011. In 2014, Ognevich was elected to the Verkhovna Rada for the Radical Party using her birth name Inna Bordiuh. She resigned from parliament after one year, citing her opposition to the corruption she had witnessed. She has been vocal in her support for Ukrainian forces during the pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, and announced she would not accept Russian citizenship following the annexation of Crimea, where Ognevich was raised. Ognevich was born in 1986 in Murmansk to Ukrainian parents; she is of Italian and Serbian descent; she has Italian ancestors on her mother's side and Serbian on her father's side. She grew up in the Crimean city of Sudak. At age 18, Ognevich moved to Kyiv, where she currently resides, to pursue a higher music education. Ognevich is a graduate of Kyiv's Rheingold M.

Ognevich in interviews has claimed she has lived in "many cities and countries". Ognevich is a soloist of the Ensemble of Song and Dance of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Ognevich made her first attempt to enter the Eurovision Song Contest with Ukraine. Her song was "Tiny Island", which finished fifth with 30 points. In 2011, she made her second unsuccessful attempt to represent Ukraine in the contest. This time the song was in the Ukrainian language. Her song was "The Kukushka" which finished second. Following complaints from viewers about the voting procedure in that years final, a new final was to be held on 3 March 2011. However, after Jamala and Ognevich withdrew from this new final in the days before it was scheduled to be held, Mika Newton became the artist to represent Ukraine. On 23 December 2012, Ognevich made her third attempt to represent Ukraine at the Eurovision Song Contest, by entering the Ukrainian national selection Evrobachennya 2013 – Natsionalyni vidbir with the song "Gravity". After scoring maximum points from both the jury and televote, Ognevich won the right to represent Ukraine at the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö, Sweden. At the competition, Ukraine qualified from the first semi-final on 14 May 2013, placing third in a field of 16 songs and scoring 140 points.

In August 2014, Ognevich released her own version of Ukraine's national anthem "Shche ne vmerla Ukraina". At the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 on 13 May 2023, Ognevich was the spokesperson for the Ukrainian national jury, announcing that its twelve points had been awarded to Sweden. In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election on 26 October, Ognevich was a candidate (as a non-partisan candidate she placed 4th on the party list) of Radical Party. According to Radical Party leader Oleh Lyashko, Ognevich was on the party list because "I understand that in the imagination of people a parliamentarian is jowly, paunchy, old, sick and stupid. I want in Parliament young, smart, beautiful". In the election, her party won twenty two seats and thus Ognevich was elected into parliament. In parliament, she focused on cultural and copyright issues. Ognevich was present at 57% of all parliamentary sessions during her tenure in parliament. On 10 November 2015, Ognevich submitted a letter of resignation to parliament. In her resignation speech to parliament on the same day, she stated; "Now I see that when there is no culture it’s easier to rule and manipulate people. That’s why in these circumstances, as cultural activist, I’m not helpful to this parliament…". In the speech, she also accused her former colleagues of serving lobbyist interests and not the general public. Five months after the March 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, Ognevich called the annexation "a very painful tragedy" and stated that her parents, who continue to live in Crimea, would not obtain Russian citizenship. During the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine Ognevich and fellow Ukrainian singer Anastasia Prikhodko raised money for the 72nd Guards Mechanized Brigade. Both Russia and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union since 1920 till Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union on 24 August 1991. Crimea is currently under dispute by Russia and Ukraine. "People's Deputy of Ukraine of the VIII convocation". Official portal (in Ukrainian). Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.
