In the 1980s, young Fabietto lives at home in Naples with his father Saverio Schisa and mother Maria Schisa. He doesn’t have many friends or a lover, and wants to study philosophy in college. For the time being, he mainly spends time listening to music and watching Diego Maradona play for his home team, Napoli. His brother Marchino takes him to acting auditions and sympathizes with his affection for their emotionally troubled aunt Patrizia. Fabietto’s parents are building a new home in Roccaraso. They visit the home without Fabietto who decides to stay at home. His parents die of carbon monoxide from the fireplace in the new home. Due to this, Fabietto comes of age in a cruel and brutal manner.

That same month, a lawyer for Diego Maradona stated he was considering legal action against the film for its title, as it is a reference to Maradona's 1986 FIFA World Cup goal against England, and use of Maradona's image was not authorized. Netflix responded that the film is not a sports film or about Maradona and instead a personal story inspired by Sorrentino's youth. In September 2020, Toni Servillo joined the cast of the film, with principal photography commencing that same month, in Naples, Italy.
