Lucena (IPA: [lʊˈsɛna] loo-SEH-nɘ), officially the City of Lucena (Filipino: Lungsod ng Lucena), is a 1st class highly urbanized city in the Calabarzon region of the Philippines. It is the capital city of the province of Quezon where it is geographically situated but, in terms of government and administration, the city is politically independent from the province. For statistical and geographical purposes, Lucena is grouped with the province of Quezon. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 278,924 people. Lucena is one of the proposed metropolitan area in the Philippines. Metro Lucena is proposed to included the highly urbanized city of Lucena, as well as the towns of Candelaria, Dolores, Lucban, Pagbilao, Sampaloc, San Antonio, Sariaya, Tayabas and Tiaong. In the 1570s, Captain Juan de Salcedo first explored what was then Kalilayan, later founded as a province in 1591. The Franciscan priests Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa between 1580 and 1583 founded its town, also named "Tayabas". Tayabas was organized by the Spaniards through the Franciscan missionaries and Lucena was just one of its barrios. Tayabas became the provincial capital in 1749, renaming the province after it. The Spaniards of the 16th century called the area "Buenavista" because of its scenic beauty; several years later, the barrio was renamed "Oroquieta". A century later, Muslim pirates began terrorizing the entire Philippine coastline, and Oroquieta was not spared from the notorious raids. The barrio folks built forts along the seashores to defend it against the attacking pirates along the coast, particularly in the present-day Cotta and in Barangay Mayao, though these structures are no longer extant. Hence, the place became known as Cotta, the Spanish form of the Tagalog "kuta" ("fort"). The growth of local maritime trade facilitated in the Cotta port and the final defeat of Moro pirates plying the Luzon and Visayan waters, afforded the growth of Lucena as a town which eventually led to its being the provincial capital of Tayabas in 1901. Finally on November 3, 1879, a royal decree was issued and the Orden Superior Civil officially adopted the name "Lucena" in honor of a Spanish friar by the name of Father Mariano Granja who came from Lucena, Córdoba in Andalucia, Spain. Fr. Granja was responsible for the development of the barrio that became a Parish in 1881. Lucena became an independent municipality on June 1, 1882. During the 1896 Philippine Revolution, the people of Lucena showed their brand of patriotism. José Zaballero led the local revolutionists who were under the barrage of Spanish muskets. Later, Miguel Arguilles with Jose Barcelona as president formed a revolutionary government in Lucena. After Aguinaldo proclaimed the nation's independence on June 12, 1898, in Kawit, Cavite, Gen. Miguel Malvar, as Commanding General for Southern Luzon, took over Tayabas Province on August 15, 1898. Don Crisanto Marquez became Lucena's first elected Municipal president during the first Philippine Republic. Lucena's fertile soil became soaked with the blood of many Filipinos and Americans at the outbreak of the Filipino-American War in 1899. The foreigners established a civil government in the country, and on March 12, 1901, the provincial capital was transferred from Tayabas to Lucena. On December 27, 1941, the Japanese Imperial Forces overran the city of Lucena (referred to by the locals as The Fall of Lucena), just 19 days after they set foot on Philippine soil. The Japanese wanted to strengthen their military presence in the region, sending units to capture key points in the town. The invasion was initially successful however the Japanese Imperial Forces would soon encounter stiff resistance from members of the local resistance and members of the Hunters ROTC. The underground resistance movement was tenacious. Japanese Forces would be caught off-guard with surprise assaults which often resulted in fierce close-quarters combat. Constant assaults and logistical issues would take its toll on the Japanese forces. By January 25, 1945, the Hunters ROTC guerrillas had penetrated into the town. Using their knowledge of the local surroundings to their advantage, they moved quickly in order prevent Japanese forces from organizing a proper defense. After a hard-fought offensive, the Filipino forces had successfully driven the Japanese out of Lucena. The people of Lucena would fortify their defenses in preparation for another assault. Attempts by the Japanese to re-establish their occupation of Lucena failed. Tayabas province stood by and waited for the American Liberation forces and the Philippine Commonwealth troops, who would soon hand them their freedom on April 4, 1945. Lucena was made into a chartered city through the efforts of then-Congressman Manuel S. Enverga of Quezon's 1st district. Republic Act No. 3271 lapsed into law on June 17, 1961, without the signature of then-President Carlos P. Garcia. The induction of its city officials led by then-Mayor Castro Profugo, as well as its formal inauguration took place on August 20, 1961, as formally stated on Section 90 of Republic Act No. 3271. On July 1, 1991, Lucena became a highly urbanized city, thereby making the city independent from the province. It is situated 130 kilometers (81 mi) south of Manila. The city proper is wedged between two rivers, Dumacaa River on the east and Iyam River on the west. Seven other rivers and six creeks serve as natural drainage for the city. Its port on the coast along Tayabas Bay is home to several boat and ferry lines operating and serving the sea lanes between Lucena and the different points in the region and as far as the Visayas. There exists a Lucena Airport (known locally as Landing) located 300 meters (980 ft) west of AMA College Lucena Campus but is no longer usable. Light aircraft can no longer make use of it as a road was built as an intersection during the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Being the provincial capital and former Government Center of the former Southern Tagalog Region, Lucena is host to most of the branches of governmental agencies, businesses, banks and service facilities in the Southern Tagalog region. Lucena is politically subdivided into 33 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios. Barangay 1 (Poblacion) Barangay 2 (Poblacion) Barangay 3 (Poblacion) Barangay 4 (Poblacion) Barangay 5 (Poblacion) Barangay 6 (Poblacion) Barangay 7 (Poblacion) Barangay 8 (Poblacion) Barangay 9 (Poblacion) Barangay 10 (Poblacion) Barangay 11 (Poblacion) Barra Bocohan Cotta Gulang-Gulang Dalahican Domoit Ibabang Dupay Ibabang Iyam Ibabang Talim Ilayang Dupay Ilayang Iyam Ilayang Talim Isabang Market View Mayao Castillo Mayao Crossing Mayao Kanluran Mayao Parada Mayao Silangan Ransohan Salinas Talao-Talao Lucena falls under Type III of the Corona's climatic classification system. It is characterized by no pronounced wet and dry seasons. Generally, the wet season is from June to November and sometimes extends up to December when the southwest monsoon is predominant.

Habagat monsoon winds pass through the province from June to October while northeasterly winds or Amihan blows through the islands from December to February. Poverty Incidence of Lucena Source: Philippine Statistics Authority Economic activities in Lucena are heavily concentrated in the poblacion (bayan) and other suburban barangays where the highly dense and constricted central business district (CBD) is home to a large cluster of different business enterprises. As population grows in tandem with new and promising business prospects, business activities spill over adjoining barangays, thus forming mini satellite commercial areas. Other commercial strips are located in the poblacion and suburban barangays where both retail and wholesale trade, including other essential services, are being engaged in. Lucena City features SM City Lucena, the biggest mall in the city located in Ibabang Dupay, which is also one of the first SM Malls in Luzon. Other Shopping Centers Include: Pacific Mall Lucena (Metro Gaisano Mall), SM Savemore Agora, Puregold Gulang-Gulang Lucena and many more. Big factories and warehouses are present in these suburban barangays like San Miguel Brewery, Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., PepsiCo Philippines, Inc., Asia Brewery, Inc. Nestlé Philippines, and Ginebra San Miguel, Inc. (formerly La Tondeña Distillers Inc.), do business in sales, distribution, and transport of assorted business products in bulk. Of the total 8,316.90 ha (20,551.5 acres) land area of Lucena City, 19 percent or 1,651.77 hectares (4,081.6 acres) cover the existing built up area. Almost 3% of this or 46.62 hectares (115.2 acres) cover the industrial section, located in different barangays of the city. These areas are home to significant industrial and manufacturing activities. Industry in Lucena produces a sustainable amount of agro-industrial-based products, dried and smoked fish, distilled liquors, bamboo and rattan furniture, ornamental flowers/plants, vegetable as well as meat products. Lucena is also known as the "Cocopalm City of the South". Nestled midst a wide expanse of coconut lands, Lucena has coconut oil mills which produce oil-based household products like cooking oil, soap, lard, margarine, and oil-based medicines. Exora Cooking Oil and Vegetable Lard, and Miyami Cooking Oil are proudly made in this city. Tantuco Industries, JnJ Oil Industries, Inc., and Monaco Oil Company are some of the well-known coconut oil companies in the city.

Over the years, it was observed that a growing number of visitors from other places come to Lucena. Travelers of various types and sizes are drawn to Lucena because of modern facilities and good amenities that could be found in the city such as the Quezon Convention Center when the City of Lucena hosted the 2004 SEABA Under-18 Championship qualifying tournament for the 2004 FIBA Asia Under-18 Championship in India, Kalilayan Civic Centre, Sentro Pastoral Auditorium, Alcala Sports Complex a two time host of a Palarong Pambansa (1976, 1989), Manuel S.

Pasayahan sa Lucena (May 1–31) is a secular festival conceptualized to showcase the natural and ecological interrelationship and independence between nature and man. It also promotes the ways of life inherent among the people of Lucena. All these find exquisite and appreciative expressions through a mammoth gathering of colors, outlandish costumes, and symbolic floats reminiscent of Mardi Gras in Rio de Janeiro and New Orleans. In fact, the event is indeed known as Mardi Gras among the city’s more senior residents. Originally intended as three days of spirited merrymaking in the streets, the event has become a monthlong tourist attraction. The first Pasayahan in 1987 was a big triumph that it has become an annual affair. Year after year the Pasayahan draws a sea of frolicking humanity. Pasayahan features Chami Festival to promote Lucena’s very own native delicacy, the chami. Other features such as the Midnight Madness Sale and street concerts take stage in the Pasayahan. The celebration also coincides with the Feast of St. Ferdinand, one of the patrons in Lucena, celebrated every 30th of May.
