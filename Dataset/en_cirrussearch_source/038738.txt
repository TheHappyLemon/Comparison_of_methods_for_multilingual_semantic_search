Therefore, Tsai has been trying to introduce the most popular Western dance music elements into the Chinese music scene, she believed that "when making popular music, we should lead people to accept new styles and new elements, and challenge existing concepts." In addition, she has also named Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, and others as inspirations. Tsai has been experimenting with different musical styles and adding personal musical ideas, she said: "In addition to challenging various styles, I explore how to interpret and express them with my own colors." Her musical style is mainly dance-pop, she believed that "every singer must establish own brand and characteristics. Maybe I don't have many representative ballad works, but dance music is what I am best at." Her debut album 1019 (1999) featured ballads, but also Included the R&B track "Because of You" and the hip-hop track "Out on the Street".

Her next two albums Show Your Love (2000) and Lucky Number (2001) featured R&B and hip-hop, and also incorporated elements such as disco. Her 2003 album Magic, which combined elements of disco, funk, hip-hop, rock, and R&B, is considered to be her first musical transformation, establishing her musical direction dominated by dance music. Her 2004 album Castle continued the styles of the previous album, and included the tracks "36 Tricks of Love" and "Priority" that integrated heavy metal music element, as well as the chanson track "Love Love Love". Many of the dance tracks on her 2005 album J-Game were heavily influenced by electronic music, and in addition to retaining the elements of disco and hip-hop in the previous two albums, the track "Exclusive Myth" incorporated hip-hop and Chinese traditional music. Her 2006 album Dancing Diva is based on pop and electronic music, while the title track of the album revealed a strong exotic style, it also included the electronic rock track "Good Guy".

Tsai possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range, her voice is quite recognizable, but since her debut, she has often been criticized for her weak singing skills, including problems such as thin voice and limited range. Taiwanese musician Bing Wang once said: "[Tsai's] singing skills are very ordinary, but the good thing is that her enunciation has characteristics." She debuted her career by winning a singing competition, one judge Wawa Chen said: "She [Tsai] is really a natural talent, she is singing with her talent." Sohu Entertainment said: "Jolin Tsai's musical works have been continuously recognized in recent years. In addition, in terms of singing skills, you can also hear her real improvement in essence, for the two successful albums of Muse and Play, people no longer only praise her style of music, but her singing has gained new attention, and her vocals and singing methods in ballads and even electronic dance music have accumulated and sublimated." Qu Er of Tencent Entertainment pointed out that Tsai's singing skills have often been misunderstood, and believed that "Jolin Tsai has top breath and high-pitched skills, and there are not many singers who still have the smooth breath after dancing the whole show." Tsai has been nominated for Golden Melody Award for Best Female Mandarin Singer four times, and won the award for her 2006 album Dancing Diva. This was her first time to receive a Golden Melody Award, but some people have questioned whether her singing strength has been qualified for the award. Liu Ya-wen, chief jury of the 18th Golden Melody Awards, responded that Tsai's all-round qualities were the reason for her success, and said: "Jolin Tsai leads the way with her smart, dexterous, and excellent singing and writing performances, especially her album Dancing Diva is very rich in content, allowing her to break away from an entertainer and become a real vocalist." She was nominated for ten Golden Melody Awards for her 2014 album Play, but was not nominated for the category of Best Female Mandarin Singer after a judge raised the issue of serious pitch correction on the album, which influenced the voting of other judges. Regarding this, Tsai's manager Tom Wang responded: "Jolin Tsai is not a singer who relies on pitch correction. Welcome to listen to her live performance. I have confidence in her ability." DJ Casey Cheng said that he didn't think there was a problem with pitch correction, and believed that "records are creating very unique sounds." In 2017, she performed at the 54th Golden Horse Awards, she was out of tune when she sang the first song "Tian mi mi", and because a series of later songs were dominated by low pitch, her overall performance was not good because she was usually good at middle and high pitches, the performance was discussed and criticized by many people, and she also freely admitted to her mistakes. Tsai has a high quality pursuit of music videos, creating content with creativity and aesthetic value while taking into account commercial efforts. According to Apple Music: "She [Tsai] has always been on the cutting edge of fashion, and her music videos are full of varied costumes, sometimes colorful and sometimes avant-garde, very dazzling. Her music videos occasionally carry exotic colors, from the Gothic architecture of 'Prague Square' to the Siamese style of 'The Spirit of Knight', it seems like everyone is traveling around the world together. In recent years, Tsai has praised diversity through songs, and visually presents the depth of music with music videos: 'We're All Different, Yet the Same' was adapted from a true story, through same-sex wedding, deeply explored the issue of gender equality; 'Ugly Beauty' used absurd plots and styles to accuse rigid aesthetics." You Zuo of The Beijing News said: "In the shooting of music videos, she has made breakthroughs in almost every album. Although it is not without the kind of traditional music videos that focus on showing the singer's image. But at the same time, music videos with such a strong style like 'Play', 'Womxnly', and 'Lady in Red' are coming out, and her work has evolved with each album." Tsai's music videos have been recognized by professional awards domestically and overseas. The music videos of the songs "Honey Trap", "The Great Artist", "Play", "I'm Not Yours", "Ugly Beauty", and "Lady in Red" have all been nominated for Golden Melody Award for Best Music Video, while the music videos of the songs "The Great Artist", "Play", "I'm Not Yours", and "Ugly Beauty" all won Golden Pin Design Awards. In addition, the music video of the song "The Great Artist" was awarded the Bronze Award for Visual Design at the International Design Awards. The music video of the song "Play" was described by Time as "might be 2014's best pop music video", and won Red Dot Design Award for Visual Communication Design. The music video of the song "Sweet Guilty Pleasure" won the Gold Award for Best Music Video at the Telly Awards. Tsai's fashion taste has always been the focus of public attention, and her unique style of dressing has led the fashion trend, she is the "Fashion Queen" of the popular music industry in the eyes of the public. Since her debut, she has been known for her bold and innovative fashion style, "[Tsai] has gradually changed from a girly and sexy style to a trendy and avant-garde fashion style, and with a variety of styles, she is firmly on the throne of the 'Queen of Pop'," said Anny Ting of Vogue Taiwan. Her debut appearance was as pure and cute as the girl next door, so she became popular among teenagers and was named the "Teenage Boy Killer", then she encountered a contractual dispute, and started again with the album Magic (2003), returning to the public eye with a fashionable and sexy look and dynamic dance music. In 2003, she was named Taiwan's "Fashion Hierarch" by the Taiwan edition of Ray magazine for her versatile look. In 2006, she was awarded The Style Award at the MTV Asia Awards. In the same year, she was voted the Best Fashion Artist by fashion magazine editors and netizens in a voting held by Yahoo! Taiwan. In 2016, Vogue reported on her versatile styles and outfits, and praised her bold attempts and ability to pull off various looks. Since 2007, Tsai has been invited to attend international fashion events such as the "Big Four" fashion weeks, the Met Gala, and the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, and became the first Chinese singer to attend all these six fashion events, the first Taiwanese artist to attend the Met Gala, and the first Asian artist to attend the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. She has appeared on the covers of Vogue, Elle, Harper's Bazaar, and Marie Claire several times. In addition, she has been ranked top ten on the FHM Taiwan's 100 Sexiest Women list eight times from 2000 to 2018, including one time being ranked top one. She also led the nail art trend. In 2005, she appeared the cover of the Taiwan edition of Nail Up magazine and was dubbed the "Queen of Nail Art" by the magazine. Tsai has always been an artist with lucrative commercial interests, and has been called the "Queen of Money-Making" by the media for many years. She has been the highest-paid Taiwanese female singer of the year from 2004 to 2019, and the second highest-paid Taiwanese female singer of the year in 2020 and 2021. In 2014, Hong Kong's Next Magazine reported that her net worth exceeded NT$2 billion. Her record sales have so far exceeded 25 million copies, making her the highest-selling Taiwanese female recording artist since 2000. Beginning with her 2003 album Magic, each of her studio albums has been the highest-selling album by a female artist in Taiwan in the year of release, with four of which also being the highest-selling album overall in the country in the respective years of release. She has been ranked top 20 on the Forbes China Celebrity 100 list for six out of ten times since 2010, including being ranked top one in terms of Chinese female singer three times. In addition, she was also listed among the Forbes Asia's 100 Digital Stars, with more than 43 million followers on Sina Weibo and 4 million followers on Instagram by the end of 2020, she became one of the most influential social media celebrities in the Asia-Pacific region. Tsai is considered a gay icon by the LGBT community. In 2012, she participated in the gender equality initiative by the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights. Later, she expressed her support for the LGBT community through her songs such as "Dr. Jolin", "Fantasy", "Gentlewomen", "We're All Different, Yet the Same", and "Womxnly". In 2015, she was awarded Icon of the Year at the Asia LGBT Milestone Awards, with judges recognizing her as a public figure in support of LGBT rights despite the pressure of public opinion. In the same year, she featured on the cover of the lesbian magazine Lezs, stating that it was only natural for her to advocate for gender equality and same-sex marriage rights. In 2017, Billboard's Tamar Herman reported that she has promoted the value of love and quality through provocative songs and music videos in the generally conservative Chinese music industry, making her one of the most visible icons for LGBT people in Asia, Tsai responded: "I don’t intend to become an idol for any specific group of people. All I want to do is to encourage some people by saying things I think to be right, so that they know they are not alone." Tsai has become a symbol of the C-pop music scene with her music, image, and dance, as well as her never-giving spirit and boundless potential. "Back in the early 2000s, Taiwanese artists such as Jay Chou and Jolin Tsai dominated Chinese-speaking markets throughout Asia, creating a golden era for Taiwanese pop music," said Liu Hsiu-wen of Billboard. "Her [Tsai] artistic achievements have already set an unsurpassable benchmark in the C-pop music industry. The name 'Jolin Tsai' can be said to have accompanied a generation of young people through two decades of brilliant youth," said Hung Hsiu-chu, former chairwoman of the Chinese Nationalist Party. NetEase Entertainment's Liang Xiaohui said: "Perhaps, in a few more generations, when we look back on the Chinese divas in the early 21st century, the first one that comes to mind will be Jolin Tsai rather than others, just as looking back at the second half of the 20th century, you can never avoid the shining name of Madonna." In 2010, she was awarded Top Ten Influential Hong Kong/Taiwan Music Figures of the Decade at the Top Chinese Music Awards. Having a status to influence Chinese popular culture, Tsai has exerted a positive influence in the field of social issues. Billboard's Tamar Herman said: "As the reigning goddess of Chinese pop music, Tsai has represented same-sex couples and diverse LGBTQ+ lifestyles through her bright pop songs, offering an outlet for diverse expression in the generally conservative Chinese music scene. Through provocative songs and music videos that encourage self-love and understanding of one another's differences, Jolin has become one of the most visible icons in Asia's LGBTQ+ community." Liao Yuanling of Business Today said: "Jolin Tsai constantly uses microphones and spotlights to increase the energy of paying more attention to gender equality, but also use her diva halo, as the backer of these minority groups, making them feel more brave to speak up for themselves." In 2019, in the "Who Are the Most Influential Women to the New Generation" survey jointly conducted by Cheers magazine and Elle Taiwan, she was ranked first in the field of fashion styles, and second in both fields of gender issues and life attitudes. Tsai's dance-pop has become an indicator of mainstream music in Greater China, and she has led the way for dance-pop to become mainstream music in the region. Fan Jung-ching of Taiwan's Bloomberg Businessweek named her the "Great Chinese Dance Music Artist", and said: "Jolin Tsai has composed 'her era' with music, and has made the world know the world-class quality of Chinese dance music." "Jolin has elevated the pattern of Chinese dance music and has set a high standard that is difficult to surpass," said Hou Cheng-nan, associate professor of the Department of Mass Communication at I-Shou University. QQ Music's critic Mimimao said: "Jolin Tsai is undoubtedly the biggest contributor to the development of electronic dance music in the C-pop music industry, and electronic dance music has also completely fulfilled Tsai's music career, bringing the C-pop industry of the second decade of the 21st century into 'Jolin's era'. Tsai's keen sense of trend and bold attempts have become the benchmark of Chinese dance music, making her far ahead of her competitors of the same period." According to Apple Music: "Jolin Tsai’s legacy is built on her tenacity as much as her pioneering vision. Moving on from her first incarnation of sweet idol singer in 1999, she honed her signature slick dance-pop and dazzling moves on albums like Dancing Diva in 2006. But this was just the beginning for the daring artist, who continued to innovate her sound—and became an LGBTQ icon in the process. Songs like 'Play' and 'Ugly Beauty' are both sharp societal critiques and helped set new visual and creative standards for Mandopop, leaving no doubt about Tsai’s lasting artistic relevance." She has influenced many artists and has become the idol and learning object of many other artists, including Cyndi Wang, Rainie Yang, A-Lin, Lala Hsu, Eve Ai, Shi Shi, Emma Wu, Yao Yao, By2, and others. You Zuo of The Beijing News said: "As one of the most influential female stars in the C-pop music scene, Jolin Tsai's insistence on making breakthroughs in art and caring for the society deserves the respect of everyone who cares about C-pop music." Tsai has endorsed many internationally renowned brands and products since her debut, including Absolut Vodka, Adidas, Always, Balvenie, Bausch & Lomb, Bulgari, Crest, Diablo, Dr. Jart+, Dungeon & Fighter, Gap, Head & Shoulders, Intel, Knorr, Levi's, L'Oréal, Lux, Max Factor, McDonald's, Mercedes Benz, Morinaga, Motorola, Nars, Olay, Pepsi, Pony, Puma, Quaker, Rémy Martin, Samsung, Shiseido, Standard Chartered, Sunbites, Swarovski, Toyota, Tropicana, Uber Eats, Valentino, Vidal Sassoon, Yamaha, 7-Eleven, etc. Tsai has cooperated with some of the brands to launch cooperative products. In December 2018, Pony launched two limited-edition collaborative sneakers of her design, based on the brand's M100 series of sneakers. In July 2019, Gap released six collaborative T-shirts she designed, inspired by six songs from her 2018 album Ugly Beauty. In September 2019, Gap released four long-sleeved pullover hoodies designed by her. In September 2007, Tsai and her sister released the nail polish brand Oops! Jealous, which was originally sold on the Taiwanese online shopping website PayEasy, while she was mainly responsible for the development of nail polish colors and styles. In August 2010, PayEasy and it further cooperated and sold its products in the vending machine at Qsquare in Taipei, Taiwan. In October 2011, it entered the personal care chain retailer Watson. It has been discontinued since 2014. In February 2009, Tsai and Ken Erman announced the release of the fashion brand Seventy Two Changes in New York City.

On October 20, 2015, Tsai opened a fondant cake fan page Your Majesty on Facebook. On December 7, 2015, she set up a company mainly engaged in the affairs of the fondant cake brand, which mainly sold fondant cakes and offered customized fondant cake order services on Facebook and Instagram.

Tsai's personal life has been discussed and concerned by the public and the media. Since her debut, she has had suspected or real long-term romantic relationships with three male artists, Jay Chou, Eddie Peng, and Vivian Dawson. In January 2001, she and Chou met on the CTV variety show, Guess. In December 2001, she and Chou were seen dining at an izakaya in Shinjuku, Japan, and the two were later seen meeting privately several times in Taiwan.

In January 2007, she and Eddie Peng were seen together in London, England, and the two were seen meeting privately in Taiwan several times. In September 2008, Peng was involved in a dispute with his management company, which allegedly tried to block his relationship with Tsai. In August 2009, Peng's former manager Liu Wei-tzu indirectly confirmed that Tsai and Peng had been in a relationship for more than three years since mid-2006, and that the breakup was suspected to be due to Peng's mother preventing the two from continuing their relationship because she was unhappy with Tsai's reluctance to disclose her relationship with Peng. In July 2010, Vivian Dawson appeared in the music video of her song "Love Player". In September 2010, she and Dawson were seen together in Tokyo, Japan, and the two later traveled together around the world several times. In November 2011, her father indirectly confirmed the relationship between Tsai and Dawson, and indirectly revealed that Tsai had relationships with both Chou and Peng. In February 2013, she and Dawson flew to New Zealand to meet his parents, and the relationship between the two was confirmed.
