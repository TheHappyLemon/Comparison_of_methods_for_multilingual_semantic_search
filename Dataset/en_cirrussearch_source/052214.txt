Jiangmen (Chinese: 江门), alternately romanized in Cantonese as Kongmoon, is a prefecture-level city in Guangdong Province in southern China. It consists of three urban districts (Pengjiang, Jianghai, Xinhui), Heshan, and the more rural Siyi (Xinhui, Taishan, Kaiping, and Enping), which is the ancestral homeland of approximately 4 million overseas Chinese. As of the 2020 census, the entire prefecture has a total population of about 4,798,090 inhabitants; its urban region (Pengjiang, Jianghai, plus Heshan being conurbated) has 2,657,062 inhabitants, which can also be considered part of the Guangzhou–Shenzhen metro conurbation with 65,565,622 inhabitants. Jiangmen is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese name 江門 or 江门, based on its pronunciation in the Mandarin dialect. Its former Wade-Giles spelling was Chiang-men. The Postal Map spelling "Kongmoon" was based upon the same name's Cantonese pronunciation Gong¹-moon⁴. Other forms of the name include Kongmoon, Kongmun, and Kiangmoon.[citation needed] Jiangmen is also known as Pengjiang.[clarification needed][why?] Its rural hinterland is known to the Chinese diaspora as the "Four Counties" (q.v.), although the addition of Heshan to Jiangmen has prompted the remaining locals to begin calling it the "Five Counties" instead. Jiangmen was forced to open up to western trade in 1904, after a 1902 declaration which made it a treaty port. During the subsequent period of western influence, a number of western-style buildings were constructed along the city's waterfront, and currently, the city's government is partaking in a renewal project to restore many of these buildings.[citation needed] On 6 August 1925, the Guangdong provincial government placed Jiangmen under direct administration of the provincial government. Jiangmen was given a city government on 26 November of the same year. In 1931, this status would be revoked, and the city was placed under the administration of Xinhui County. The city was incorporated into the People's Republic of China on 23 October 1949, and was proclaimed a city in 1951. The city later became the prefectural seat for the Sze Yup ("Four County") region including Taishan, Kaiping, Xinhui, Enping. In Mainland China but not abroad, the area became known as the "Five Counties" when Heshan was added to Jiangmen's jurisdiction.[citation needed] In June 1983, the city was upgraded to a prefecture-level city. In 1996, built the Jiangmen Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone (Jiangmen National-Level High-Tech Industry Development Zone) in Jianghai district. In 2006, built the bingjiang Zone in pengjiang district. In 2011, the city banned pet dogs in public after rabies killed 42 people over the preceding 3 years. The city reserved a 13-acre site to allow rural Chinese to adopt the 30,000 dogs, but public outcry led to a softer implementation where violators would be told to leave rather than have the dog confiscated. In 2017, Jiangmen Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone ranked 64th among national hi-tech zones in China. In 2020, Jiangmen Station of the West Pearl River Delta Transportation Center, in Southwest China's Guangdong province, opened to the public. The city is located on the lower reaches of the Xi River and the Tan River [zh], in the western section of the Pearl River Delta in the middle of southern Guangdong Province. It faces the South China Sea in the south and is 100 kilometres (62 mi) away from Guangzhou and Zhuhai by highway.[citation needed] Jiangmen city has an area of 9,260 square kilometres (3,580 sq mi), about one quarter the size of the Pearl River Delta.[citation needed] The climate is subtropical with monsoonal influences. The annual average temperature is 22.36 °C (72.25 °F). Jiangmen was selected by the Chinese state as a pilot city for a nationwide information programme.[which?] It was also chosen by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) as a trial city for the Regional Integration for Sustainable Economics (RISE) project. According to the World Bank's "Report on Investment Environment in China" for 2005, Jiangmen was ranked the sixth most conducive city in China for investment. The economic development strategies within Jiangmen focus on the three urban districts, and the south, middle and north lines.[citation needed] It is planned to develop four main economic areas: the central urban district of the city, the Yinzhou Lake (银州湖; 銀州湖) economic area, and two economic areas along the various transport axes.[citation needed] In 2018, the city reported a GDP of 290.041 billion Yuan, government revenue totaling 24.393 billion Yuan, and retail sales totaling 140.758 billion Yuan. Similar to other cities in the western Pearl River Delta, the manufacturing sector plays a significant role in Jiangmen's economy. The chief industries include manufacturing of New energy, machinery, textiles, paper, food products, electronics, EMU, and building materials. Other major industries include high-speed rail,motorcycles, household appliances, food processing, synthetic fibers and garments, and stainless steel products.[citation needed] Global brand names with a presence in the city include BP, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Hyundai, Panasonic, Veolia, Hutchison Whampoa, ABB and Tesco. Some worldwide brand which have factories in Jiangmen such include Basf, Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings and Lee Kum Kee foods.[citation needed] The city was the proposed site of a $6.5 billion, 40 billion renminbi, uranium processing plant which would have supplied about half of the enriched uranium needed by China's nuclear power plants. Announcement of the plant in July 2013 was met by public protests. The proposal was withdrawn out of "respect for public opinion" shortly thereafter. Jiangmen Port is the second largest river port in Guangdong province. The local government plans to develop a harbour industrial zone with heavy industries to include petrochemical and machinery plants, as well as an ocean-based economy.[citation needed] Jiangmen is the ancestral homeland of approximately 4 million overseas Chinese, who live in 107 countries and regions throughout the world. Strong oversea connections are especially found in the villages.[citation needed] The dialect spoken in Jiangmen city itself is a Siyi Yue dialect, but is distinct from the Taishanese spoken in Taishan City. Every year, A unique dragon dance is performed in water during Pan Village Lantern Festival in Shuikou Town, Kaiping, Jiangmen, Guangdong. A significant amount of historical heritage survives from the period of mass emigration prior to World War II. The most significant are the fortified multi-story towers found mainly in Kaiping. These are known as "Gold Mountain Towers" or diaolou. A number of natural hotspring resorts has been developed successfully by using its wealthy natural heated ground water resources such as Gudou Hotspring Resort (古兜温泉). Guifeng Mountain, a mountain visited by many tourists, is the peak of Jiangmen with an elevation of 545 meters above sea level. The local government's economic development strategies emphasize the development of tourism and protection of the environment.[citation needed] Wuyi University is the only university which is founded within the city, whereby it's one of the member of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao University Alliance (GHMUA). And Guangzhou Huali College Jiangmen campus is also located in the city. And there are also some Vocational colleges in the city: Jiangmen Polytechnic College, located at Chaolian Island, enrolls about 13,000 students in various technical and humanities programs.

Jiangmen No. 1 Middle School is claimed[by whom?] to be the top middle school in the district. It used to be one of the best middle schools in Guangdong Province in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the quality of its education has been dropping in recent years and within the district of Jiangmen, its status is being constantly challenged by schools such as Xinhui No. 1 Middle School in Xinhui, Kaiqiao (Kaiping Emigrant) Middle School in Kiaping and Heshan No.1 Middle School in Heshan. Jiangmen has a mature network of inter-city and intra-city highways and expressways, whose total length has reached 10,084.97 kilometres (6,266.51 mi) as of 2016.

Several provincial highways, such as S273, S274, S276 and S367 link the city's suburb areas to major towns. Although the very first railway, Sun Ning Railway, began operation in 1909, it was discontinued in 1938 to deny its use by the Japanese military. The second operational railway is the Jiangmen branch of Guangzhou–Zhuhai intercity railway (opened 2011), which provides frequent service from Jiangmen railway station / Jiangmen East railway station to Guangzhou South Railway Station, where connections to the nation's high-speed railway network are available.
