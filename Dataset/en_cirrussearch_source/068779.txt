The 2027 FIBA Basketball World Cup will be the 20th FIBA Basketball World Cup, the quadrennial international basketball championship contested by the men's national teams of FIBA. The tournament will be hosted in Qatar from 27 August to 12 September 2027. It will be the first FIBA Basketball World Cup to be held in the Arab world, and the third straight to be held in Asia after the 2019 tournament in China and the 2023 edition co-hosted by the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia. Qatar will also be the third Muslim country to host, after the 2010 edition in Turkey and 2023 edition in Indonesia. Germany will be the defending champions heading into the tournament, having beaten Serbia in the 2023 final. During its Central Board meeting in Metro Manila, Philippines, on 28 April 2023, FIBA announced that Qatar will host the upcoming World Cup in 2027. The country was chosen via a unanimous vote. As hosts, Qatar earned an automatic qualification for the tournament when they were awarded the hosting rights. 80 teams from four FIBA zones will qualify for the World Cup qualifiers through qualification for the FIBA Continental Cups (AfroBasket 2025, 2025 FIBA AmeriCup, 2025 FIBA Asia Cup, and EuroBasket 2025). For Europe and the Americas, additional teams will qualify through the pre-qualifiers of the said regions. The participants of both the AfroBasket and the Asia Cup comprise the teams that will also take part in the qualifiers for their respective regions. The first round of the Americas, Asia/Oceania, and Africa qualifiers will feature 16 teams each, whereas Europe will have 32 teams. Division A teams will be split into groups of four, to be held in a home-and-away round-robin. The top three teams in each group will advance to the second round. In round two of the World Cup qualifiers, teams will be split into six groups, totaling four groups in Europe and two in the other qualifiers. Teams carried over the points from round one, and faced the other three teams again in a home-and-away round-robin. The best teams in each group will qualify for the World Cup. No wild card selection will be held, and the Olympic champions will not be guaranteed a spot in the tournament. As hosts, Qatar automatically qualified for the tournament. They will make their return to the World Cup since their last appearance in 2006 where they placed at joint 21st place. In their official bid video, Qatar proposed four venues for the World Cup. According to FIBA, Qatar was selected as the host nation due to the proximity of its proposed venues; being located "in one city" and are 30 minutes apart from each other. Three of the four venues, namely the Lusail Sports Arena, Ali Bin Hamad Al Attiya Arena, and the Duhail Handball Sports Hall were built for the 2015 World Men's Handball Championship. The Aspire Dome is a multi-purpose arena built to host multiple sports at the same time. It hosted several events at the 2006 Asian Games, as well as the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships and the 2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. All four venues will also host various sports during the 2030 Asian Games. At halftime of the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup final between Germany and Serbia at the SM Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay, Metro Manila, a turnover ceremony took place officially hand over the hosting rights of the FIBA Basketball World Cup from the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia to Qatar. FIBA Central Board members Manuel V. Pangilinan from the Philippines and Yuko Mitsuya from Japan, and member of the Indonesian House of Representatives Budi Djiwandono passed a ball to then-FIBA President Hamane Niang, who then passed it to Qatar Basketball Federation President Mohammed Saad Al-Meghaiseeb and Marketing and Communications Director of the Qatar Olympic Committee Sheikha Asma Al Thani. The tournament will be played in three phases - the group stage, the second round, and the final phase. In the group stage, the 32 qualified teams will be sorted into eight groups of four (A–H), where every team in a group will play each other once. The top two teams from each group will then advance to the second round. The bottom two teams will then play two classification games to determine the 17th to 32nd rankings. In the second round, there will be four groups (I–L) of four made up of the teams that advanced from the first round, again playing each other once. The top two teams from groups I to L will qualify for the final phase. The teams that lost in the quarterfinals will then play classification games to determine the 5th to 8th rankings. 2026 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup For marketing purposes, all venues are considered as located in Doha despite one situated in Lusail and two in Al Rayyan.
