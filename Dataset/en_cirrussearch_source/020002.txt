Chvaletice (Czech pronunciation: [ˈxvalɛcɪtsɛ]) is a town in Pardubice District in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 2,900 inhabitants. The village of Hornická Čtvrť is an administrative part of Chvaletice. Chvaletice is located about 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of Pardubice. It lies in the Polabí region; the northern part of the municipal territory lies in the East Elbe Table and the southern part lies in the northwestern tip of the Iron Mountains. The highest point is the flat hill Oklika at 308 m (1,010 ft) above sea level. The Elbe River forms the northern municipal border. In the area there were originally two villages, Telčice and Chvaletice, both administered by Chvaletice. The first written mention of Telčice comes from 1143 and of Chvaletice from 1393. In 1953, Telčice became a separate municipality, however in 1975 Telčice and Chvaletice were merged into one municipality. In 1981, Chvaletice obtained town rights. Since ancient times, iron ore was mined here, until the Thirty Years' War; then again since the end of 18th century. Mining of pyrite-manganium ore started in the 20th century. The mines got exhausted and were finally closed in 1975. In 1973–1979, the Chvaletice Power Station was built, with the coal being moved in from mines in northern Bohemia by ships on the Elbe river. To make such shipping possible large excavation works (Elbe Waterway project) on the riverbed were carried out. Use of ships stopped in 1996. The most valuable building is the Evangelical church in Hornicka Čtvrť. It was built in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1882. "Population of Municipalities – 1 January 2023".
