They currently play in the Armenian Premier League. The home stadium of the team is the Alashkert Stadium in Yerevan. The club headquarters are located on Saryan street 25, Yerevan.

Alashkert have won the Armenian Premier League title on four occasions and the Armenian Cup once. The club has also won the Armenian Supercup three times. They are owned by Bagrat Navoyan, a businessman and founder of Bagratour LLC, and have a cooperation agreement with the Brazilian club Botafogo since August 2017. Football Club Alashkert was founded in 1990 in the town of Martuni of Gegharkunik Province. In 1992, the team played in the Premier League representing Martuni and using the City Stadium of the town as their home venue. However, at the end of the season the team finished last in the table, being relegated to the First League. As a result, the club withdrew from the competition. In 1998, FC Alashkert returned to professional football and participated in the First League finishing the table in 6th position. In 1999, they did not participate in the First League competition and later in early 2000, the club was dissolved. In late 2011, FC Alashkert were re-founded by Bagrat Navoyan, a businessman native of Martuni. They entered the 2012–13 Armenian First League competition and won the championship, booking their place in the Armenian Premier League for the 2013–14 season. In 2012–2013, the team was managed by the former Armenian player Albert Sarkisyan. In February 2013, the club purchased the Nairi Stadium in Yerevan, to become the official venue of their home games. As a result, the club was officially relocated from Martuni to Yerevan starting from the 2013–14 season. In the 2013/14 season, Alashkert finished bottom of the table. However, they weren't relegated. In the 2014/15 Alashkert secured a 4th placed finish and a spot in the Europa League Qualifiers. The 2015/16 season saw Alashkert have a superb performance in the Armenian Premier League, winning the title after a tough battle with runners-up Shirak SC. The 2016/17 season saw Alashkert win the Armenian league title for the second consecutive season. The 2017/18 season marked a zenith for Alashkert as they clinched the title for the third consecutive time, establishing their dominance in Armenian football. This achievement underscored the club's strategic prowess and the skillful execution of their players on the field. Facing the challenge of sustaining peak performance, Alashkert secured a fourth-place finish in the 2018/19 season. However, the subsequent season, 2019/20, demonstrated the team's ability to recalibrate and maintain a competitive edge, resulting in a commendable third-place finish. The narrative took an exhilarating turn in the 2020/21 season when Alashkert, fueled by a renewed sense of purpose, once again secured the title, adding another chapter to their storied legacy. Alashkert also finished runners-up in the Armenian Cup, losing 3-1 in the final to Ararat. In 2021 Alashkert also won the Armenian Supercup, defeating Ararat 1-0 to secure the trophy. In the 2021/22 season, Alashkert maintained a competitive stance, securing a third-place finish. The recent 2022/23 season saw the club finish in fourth place, inviting strategic reflection and a renewed commitment to future seasons. In December 2017, Alashkert entered into partnerships with Brazilian clubs Botafogo and Fluminense.

However, Nairi Stadium – later renamed Alashkert Stadium – was purchased by the owners of FC Alashkert in February 2013.
