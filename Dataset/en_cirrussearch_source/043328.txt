Bartosz Bereszyński (born 12 July 1992) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Serie A club Empoli, on loan from Sampdoria, and the Poland national team. Born in Poznań, Bereszyński played youth football with TPS Winogrady Poznań, Poznaniak Poznań, Warta Poznań and Lech Poznań. He played senior football with Lech Poznań, Warta Poznań and Legia Warsaw. While with Lech Poznań, he played in the UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds. He was one of the very few players to have moved voluntarily from Lech to Legia, who are fierce rivals, was nicknamed "Judas" and received a violent reaction from the Lech fans. Bereszyński was sent off in the last round of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League group stage, and was suspended for the next three European matches. He did not feature in the second round nor the first leg of the 3rd qualification round in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. However, as his club failed to include him in their squad registration for the second round matches, he had not finished his suspension when he came on as a sub in the 86th minute in the return leg against Celtic F.C. in the third round. Legia won the match 2–0, and 6–1 on aggregate. However, after considering the mistake, UEFA set the result to a 3–0 win for Celtic. This made the Scottish team winners on the away goals rule. In January 2017, Bereszyński moved to Italy, signing a four-year deal with Sampdoria. On 7 January 2023, Napoli announced the signing of Bereszyński on loan with a purchase option. Following Sampdoria's relegation to Serie B at the end of the 2022–23 season, Bereszyński appeared in two games for the club before returning to top flight on 22 August 2023, when he joined Empoli on a one-year loan with an option to make the move permanent. Having previously represented Poland at youth level, in the under-19, under-20, and under-21 teams, Bereszyński made his debut for the senior national team against Liechtenstein on 4 June 2013. In June 2018 he was named in Poland's squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. On 14 March 2020, Bereszyński tested positive for COVID-19, following its pandemic in Italy. His father Przemysław Bereszyński was also a professional football player and currently a professional coach.
