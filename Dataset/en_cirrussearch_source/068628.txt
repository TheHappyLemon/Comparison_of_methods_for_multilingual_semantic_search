Anthony Michael Gordon (born 24 February 2001) is an English professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club Newcastle United and the England national team. Anthony Michael Gordon was born on 24 February 2001 in Liverpool, Merseyside, to Nadine and Keith Gordon. He is of Irish and Scottish descent. Gordon joined Everton as an 11-year-old following his release from Liverpool. On 6 December 2017, Gordon was named in Everton's first-team squad for the Europa League match away to Apollon Limassol. A day later, he made his first-team debut in the fixture, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute in a 3–0 win. On 18 January 2020, Gordon made his Premier League debut coming on as a substitute for Bernard in a 1–1 draw with West Ham United. On 26 June, he received his first Premier League start in a 0–0 draw with Liverpool. On 1 September, Gordon signed a new five-year contract with Everton. On 1 February 2021, Gordon joined Championship club Preston North End on loan for the remainder of the 2020–21 season. Five days later, he made his debut for Preston, being included in the starting line-up for a 2–1 home league defeat by Rotherham United. On 16 December, Gordon registered his first assist for Everton, as Jarrad Branthwaite scored from his free-kick in a 1–1 draw with Chelsea. On 2 January 2022, he scored his first goals for the Toffees in a 3–2 loss to Brighton & Hove Albion. On 12 February, in a 3–0 win over Leeds United, he assisted Michael Keane for Everton's second goal, before scoring their third in the second half. On 9 April, Gordon scored the only goal of the game in a win over Manchester United. In May, he was named Young Player of the Year by the senior team and the club's supporters. During the 2022 summer transfer window, he was linked with Chelsea. Gordon scored his first goals of the season in back-to-back matches against Brentford and Leeds United. He was suspended for the match against Tottenham Hotspur, because of yellow card accumulation, and returned in a 1–0 defeat to Newcastle United. He had a scuffle with Kieran Trippier, which led to a confrontation with Fabian Schär, resulting in both players getting booked. (The three players were reunited soon after his transfer to Newcastle, which was noted for Gordon's awkward interaction with Schär.) In the next match, he scored Everton's second goal in a 3–0 win over Crystal Palace. Illness kept him out for three matches, and in what turned out to be his last appearance for the Toffees, he came on as a 69th minute substitute against Southampton. After the match, he and Yerry Mina were harassed by a small section of Everton supporters. During the January transfer window, Sky Sports reported that Gordon had failed to show up to training in order to force a move away from the club to fellow Premier League club Newcastle. Gordon later expressed he had been disappointed by the curt manner that Everton announced his departure, and stated that he "was a massive part in keeping the club up" the previous season. On 29 January 2023, Gordon joined Newcastle United on a long-term contract, having submitted a formal transfer request to previous club Everton. The transfer fee reported by BBC Sport was an initial £40 million, potentially rising to £45 million in add-ons. He made his debut on 4 February as a 69th minute substitute in a 1–1 draw at home to West Ham United. On 4 March, Gordon was named in the starting line-up for the first time in a 2–0 loss to Manchester City, but was taken off in the 62nd minute, and an ankle injury would see him miss the next two matches. After making his return in a 2–0 win over Manchester United, he was mainly used as a substitute. On 8 April, against Brentford, he came on at half-time, but had the ignominy of being subbed off. He reacted angrily to manager Eddie Howe, who later explained that Gordon had come off as a precaution because of his ankle injury. Expecting a hostile reception upon his return to Goodison Park on 27 April, his contribution ended up being minimal, with the game already won as Newcastle were 4–1 up. On 28 May, Gordon scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw with Chelsea. On 12 August, Gordon assisted Sandro Tonali for the opening goal in a 5–1 win over Aston Villa. On 27 August 2023, Gordon scored his first home goal for Newcastle in a 2–1 defeat against boyhood club Liverpool. On 2 December, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Manchester United, matching Alan Shearer's streak in 1999 by scoring in four consecutive league home matches. Having represented his country at U18 and U19 level, Gordon made his debut for the England under-20s during a 2–0 victory over Wales at St George's Park on 13 October 2020. On 5 November 2021, Gordon received his first call up for the England under-21s and scored twice on his debut, a 3–1 victory over Czech Republic at Turf Moor in 2023 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification on 11 November 2021. On 14 June 2023, Gordon was included in the England squad for the 2023 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He scored during a group stage victory over Israel and also recorded the only goal of the quarter-final against Portugal. On 8 July 2023, Gordon started in the final as England beat Spain to lift the trophy. Gordon was named Player of the Tournament and also chosen in the Team of the Tournament. Gordon received his first call up for the England senior squad in March 2024 for friendlies against Brazil and Belgium. He made his debut on 23 March when starting England's 1–0 defeat to Brazil at Wembley Stadium. Gordon has a girlfriend, Annie Keating. He became a father in 2023.
