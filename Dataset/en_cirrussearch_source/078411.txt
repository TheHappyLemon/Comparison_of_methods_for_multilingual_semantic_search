Three Maxima stores were opened in Vilnius in 1992. At the end of 2011, Maxima Group bought the Aldik supermarket chain in Poland with 24 stores. Between 2012 and 2020, Maxima also operated a division in Spain, under the names SuperSol (supermarkets) and Cash Diplo (Cash & Carry). It mainly operated in Madrid and Andalusia. It was acquired in 2012 to the DinoSol group, and SuperSol was sold in 2020 to Carrefour, while Cash Diplo was subject to a corporate takeover in 2021. In 2019, "Aldik" and "Stokrotka" retail chains are merged and continue to operate under one name, "Stokrotka". Maxima LT is the largest part of Maxima Group.

So far it is not known what caused the disaster, but the police are investigating three scenarios: that there was an error in architectural design and authorities overseeing planning had been negligent; that the cause was related to the initial building procedure; and that it was caused by the current construction of the green roof. Maxima Group operated in Poland under the name of Aldik, to 2018, when these stores started changing to Stokrotka after Maxima Group became main shareholder of Poland's EMPERIA HOLDING S.A. which operates the Stokrotka name. The Spanish supermarket chain SuperSol was owned by Maxima between 2012 and 2020. The supermarket had a presence in the Madrid province (including Ávila, Guadalajara and Toledo in the metropolitan area) and Southern Spain (Andalusia, Extremadura, Ceuta and Melilla). This Spanish arm also included Cash Diplo as a Cash & Carry division. Cash Diplo was subject to a corporate takeover in 2021.
