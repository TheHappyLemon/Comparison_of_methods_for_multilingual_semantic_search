Florian Busch (born January 2, 1985, in Tegernsee, West Germany) is a German former professional ice hockey forward who last played for Eisbären Berlin of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). Busch has represented Germany at various levels from 2002 to 2008. On 23 June 2009, Busch was banned for two years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after refusing a drug test in March 2008 because he was spending time with his girlfriend when the testers visited him. He told the testers to come back several hours later, upon which he passed the test. Initially, the German Ice Hockey Federation simply fined Busch for refusing the test- allowing him to play in the 2008 World Championships- but the World Anti-Doping Agency challenged the ruling. Busch's ban was lifted in November 2009, and he signed an anti-doping pledge in December 2009. Florian Busch's profile and statistics at DEL.org (in German) "Berlin Polar Bears' 2010-11 Roster".
