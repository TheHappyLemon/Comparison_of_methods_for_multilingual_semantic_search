The 1965 Women's World Chess Championship was won by Nona Gaprindashvili, who successfully defended her title against challenger Alla Kushnir in what was to be the first of three consecutive title matches between the two strongest female players of their time. The Candidates Tournament was held in Sukhumi in September and October 1964. Three players were tied for first place, but Kushnir won the playoff in Moscow in December 1964 and earned the right to challenge the reigning champion Gaprindashvili. The championship match was played in Riga in 1965. Despite valiant opposition from Kushnir, Gaprindashvili's victory was never really in doubt.
