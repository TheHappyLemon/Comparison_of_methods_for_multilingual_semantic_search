Durbe (pronunciation; German: Durben, Lithuanian: Durbė, Polish: Dorbiany, Russian: Дурбе Durbe/Дурбен Durben) is a town in Latvia. Durbe was first noted in 1260, when the Battle of Durbe occurred near Lake Durbe. As of 2020, the population was 492. Town rights were granted to Durbe in 1893 and confirmed in 1917. Durbe manor served as the headquarters of a German brigade in 1917. The town's coat of arms was granted in 1925: a silver apple tree with seven apples, one for each day of the week. The tree represents the Durbe Apple Orchards, created in the early 20th century by the mayor and city gardener Sīmanis Klēvers. In Latvian folklore, an apple tree is also considered a magical source of youth and sympathy. The city flag was adopted in 2016.
