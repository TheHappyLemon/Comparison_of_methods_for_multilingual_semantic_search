St Macartan's Cathedral, Clogher is one of two cathedral churches in the Diocese of Clogher (the other is St Macartin's Cathedral, Enniskillen) in the Church of Ireland. It is situated in the village of Clogher, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland in the ecclesiastical province of Armagh. It was designed in 1744 by architect James Martin in a neo-classical style. According to tradition a monastery and bishopric were founded in Clogher circa 490 by St. Macartan on the orders of St. Patrick. In 1041, the church of Clogher was rebuilt, and dedicated to the memory of St. Macartin. It was again rebuilt in 1295 by Matthew M'Catasaid, Bishop of Clogher, but burnt to the ground on 20 April 1396 along with two chapels, the abbey, the court of the bishops, and thirty-two other buildings with all their contents. In 1610 the abbey and its revenues were confiscated by King James I and given to the Diocese of Clogher. The present building was erected on the site in 1744.
