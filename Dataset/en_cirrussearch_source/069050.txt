Homonhon Island is an island in the province of Eastern Samar, Philippines, on the east side of Leyte Gulf. The 20-kilometre (12 mi) long island is part of the municipality of Guiuan, encompassing eight barangays: Bitaugan, Cagusu-an, Canawayon, Casuguran, Culasi, Habag, Inapulangan, and Pagbabangnan. Mantoconan, an islet just off the northwest corner of Homonhon, is also part of the approximately 7,500 islands comprising the Philippine Archipelago. The island is one of the early Pacific contact sites between the East and the West. During the first circumnavigation of the globe, Ferdinand Magellan's three surviving vessels passed the Marianas, but did not land, even though he was out of food after crossing the Pacific Ocean. Yet he landed on the island of Homonhon on March 16, 1521. Despite Homonhon being uninhabited at that time, he was detected by the fishing boats of nearby local settlements. The local leaders arrived in more boats, receiving him warmly and trading food and supplies with Magellan's crew. Magellan later left for Limasawa Island.
