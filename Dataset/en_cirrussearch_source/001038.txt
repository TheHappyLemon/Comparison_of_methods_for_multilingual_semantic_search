Ostroróg was a private town of Poland, until 1624 owned by the Ostroróg family. Jan Ostroróg, Polish Renaissance political writer and statesman, was born there in 1436. Jakub Ostroróg also owned property here in the 16th century. Between the 16th and 17th centuries it was an important centre of Polish Protestants. After 1624, it often changed owners, it was the property of Potocki, Rej, Górski, Radziwiłł, Zaleski, Malechowski, Sapieha and Kwilecki families. After the Partitions of Poland it was annexed by Prussia. After the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 it was annexed again by Prussia, initially as part of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Poznan.
