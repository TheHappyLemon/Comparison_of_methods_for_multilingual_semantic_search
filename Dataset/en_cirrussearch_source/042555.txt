Šalčininkai (pronunciation; Polish: Soleczniki; German: Sassenicken; Yiddish: סאָלעטשניק Solechnik; Belarusian: Салечнікі) is a city in Vilnius County, Lithuania, situated south-east of Vilnius, near the border with Belarus. The name of the town derives from Šalčia river, šalta meaning cold in Lithuanian. In the medieval period the region around Šalčininkai was dominated by Lithuanians and it was the birthplace of many authors of the earliest Lithuanian-language texts (including Stanislovas Rapalionis, Jurgis Zablockis and Aleksandras Rodūnonis [lt], to name a few). At the late 19 century most of the local inhabitants were assimilated with the neighboring Belarusians and called themselves Tutejszy (the locals), while staying Catholics, that meant Polish self-identification of many. The region is known for its uncodified Belarusian vernacular (also known as 'po prostu', meaning 'simply' or 'plainly') and the city itself is considered the provincial centre of Polish culture in Lithuania (the urban centre being Vilnius). Šalčininkai attained the town status in 1956 and is now a capital of the Šalčininkai district municipality. According to the latest census of 2021, Šalčininkai had 6857 inhabitants and features a multi-ethnic population of 4930 Poles (71.9%), 920 Lithuanians (15.7%), 438 Russians (6.4%), 286 Belarusians (4.2%), 61 Ukrainians (0,9%) and 222 people of other background (3.2%). 12.2% of all inhabitants in Šalčininkai district municipality, according to the 2021 census were born abroad, while 87.8% were born in Lithuania.
