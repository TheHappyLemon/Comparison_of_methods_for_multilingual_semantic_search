It hosts the administration of Chuhuiv urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 31,018 (2022 estimate). Chuhuiv's food industry focuses on producing mayonnaise along with other staple supporting condiments.[citation needed] The City's founding date is disputed with historical assertions ranging from 1540 to 1627. Some academics believe that the city was built upon the orders Russia's first Tsar Ivan the Terrible who reigned from 1547 to 1584.[citation needed] A military fort was built adjacent to the city in 1638 by Ukrainian Cossacks of Yakiv Ostryanyn (see Ostryanyn uprising) on the order of Muscovite Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich. A military presence of some form near Chuhuiv has remained ever since. The Chuguev uprising of 1819 was a revolt of military settlers. During the government of the Soviet Union, the base became an important military training center. It has been home to the Soviet Air Force Pilot Academy and the Red Army's Artillery School. There is now a Ukrainian Air Force base adjacent to the town. The city was the home of a major Soviet Air Force base and a military pilot's academy. There is now a Ukrainian Air Force base near the city. Generally, the city has been an important military point since Cossack times. There was a Soviet Red Army Artillery School (a military academy) in Chuhuiv before World War II. On 25 September 2020 an An-26 military plane with cadets of the Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University crashed and caught fire near Chuhuiv. 26 people were killed and the sole survivor was seriously injured. There are eight schools in Chuhuiv (grades 1–11), where several Peace Corps volunteers have served since 2004. Until 18 July 2020, Chuhuiv was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and the center of Chuhuiv Municipality. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kharkiv Oblast to seven. The area of Chuhuiv Municipality was merged into Chuhuiv Raion. As part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chuhuiv was shelled by Russian forces on February 24, 2022. A 14-year-old boy was killed. On the same day, an air base near the city was attacked. Russia captured the city in late February.[citation needed] On 7 March 2022, Ukrainian forces retook the city and reportedly inflicted heavy casualties on Russian forces, allegedly killing two high-ranking Russian officers during the battle.
