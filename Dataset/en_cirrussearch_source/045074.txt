Hanifin played for the USA Hockey's U17 program based out of Ann Arbor, Michigan, but was added to the U18 national team as an underage player, helping to lead Team USA to the gold medal at the 2014 IIHF World U18 Championships. He was the highest-scoring American defenseman of the tournament with one goal and five points. After fast-tracking his high school graduation, Hanifin matriculated at Boston College as a 17-year-old, playing for the Eagles and becoming the second-youngest player in the team's history.

After missing just three games, Hanifin returned to the Hurricanes' lineup on March 24 in a 5–2 win over the Ottawa Senators. Hanifin scored what ended up being the game-winning goal.

On June 23, 2018, Hanifin was traded to the Calgary Flames (along with teammate Elias Lindholm) in exchange for Dougie Hamilton, Micheal Ferland, and prospect Adam Fox.

On February 6, 2021, in a regular season game against the Edmonton Oilers, Hanifin became the sixth youngest U.S.-born player to reach the milestone of 400 NHL games played.[citation needed] Calgary defeated Edmonton 6–4. On March 6, 2024, Hanifin was traded in a three-team deal to the Vegas Golden Knights in exchange for Daniil Miromanov, a first-round draft pick, and a conditional third-round draft pick, while the Philadelphia Flyers received a fifth-round pick from Vegas for retaining half of Hanifin's salary.
