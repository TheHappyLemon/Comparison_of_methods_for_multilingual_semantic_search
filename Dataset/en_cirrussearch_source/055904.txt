Ayşe Sultan (Ottoman Turkish: عایشه سلطان; 1541 – fl. 1598) was an Ottoman princess, the only daughter of Mihrimah Sultan and Rüstem Pasha (Grand Vizier 1544–53, 1555–61). She was granddaughter of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566) and his consort Hürrem Sultan. Ayşe Sultan was born on 25 August 1541 in Istanbul. Her father was Rüstem Pasha, a devshirme from Croatia, and her mother was Mihrimah Sultan, daughter of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and Hürrem Sultan. She was the only child of her parents. Like her cousin Hümaşah Sultan, she was reportedly beloved by their grandfather. Ayşe, her mother, and her cousin would all imitate the communication style ushered in by her grandmother Hürrem, whose letters to the Sultan are known for their colourfulness, charm, and smoothness. Ayşe married two times. Her first husband was the future Grand vizier, Semiz Ahmed Pasha. They married on 27 November 1558, when she was seventeen. The two together had nine children including, Sultanzade Abdurrahman Bey, Sultanzade Mehmed Bey, Sultanzade Mustafa Bey, Sultanzade Osman Bey, and Saliha Sultan. Her mother used to send two thousand ducats to the couple every week. Semiz Ahmed Pasha became grand vizier in 1579 until his death on 27 April 1580. After Ahmet's death, Ayşe married Feridun Ahmed Bey, who had served twice as the head scribe of the imperial chancery. The marriage took place on 7 April 1582. Kizlar Agha Mehmed Agha, served as her agent, while Miralem Mahmud Agha served as Feridun Pasha's agent. The marriage was performed by Sheikh-ul-Islam Çivizade Hacı Mehmet Efendi. Her dowry was thirty five thousand gold coins. The marriage, however, lasted only eleven months because the pasha died on 16 March 1583. After her mother's death in 1578, the Ragusans turned to her, with a petition to act in their favour and support them in a manner her mother did, whose death they mourned deeply. In fact, all of this they reported to Behram Kethüda, who by sultan's order was to attend to Ayşe after Mihrimah's death. She and her husband Semiz Pasha shared disposition towards the Ragusans. When her son Mehmed Bey was installed as sancakbey of Herzegovina in 1592, she soon wrote him a letter of recommendation for the Ragusans. In 1591, she proposed to pay the expenses of one hundred galleys for six months, if her son-in-law Çiğalazade Sinan Pasha was made Kapudan Pasha. According to the French ambassador Jacques de Germigny, Ayşe formed a political faction with Safiye Sultan to oppose Nurbanu Sultan and her allies. In 1595, Ayşe Sultan went for a pilgrimage. In 1598-99, she commissioned a fountain in Üsküdar. When she died, she was buried in the complex of Aziz Mahmud Hudayi, Üsküdar.
