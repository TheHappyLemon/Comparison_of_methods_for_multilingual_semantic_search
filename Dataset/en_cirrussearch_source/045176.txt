Teenage Paparazzo is a 2010 documentary film about the life and times of a 14-year-old paparazzi photographer named Austin Visschedyk. It was directed by actor Adrian Grenier and produced by Bert Marcus, Adrian Grenier and Matthew Cooke. Teenage Paparazzo chronicles the relationship of a 14-year-old paparazzo Austin Visschedyk and actor Adrian Grenier. Grenier encountered Visschedyk one night and decided to follow him while searching for celebrities. Grenier had set himself a mission in getting to understand the world of the paparazzi. Austin has to be tutored and stays up late at night taking pictures and surfing the internet. During the day he is often called away to photograph celebrities, which he is successful at doing due to his young age and appearance. As the film progresses Grenier realizes his rather negative influence on Visschedyk's life. A year after initial production of the film ended, Austin's attitude and behavior has changed for the better. Grenier offers Austin a relationship stronger than the pap-celebrity one they have had. The film concludes with Austin telling Adrian to turn the camera off, which he subsequently does. Teenage Paparazzo premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. It aired on HBO on September 27, 2010, and was released on DVD on March 29, 2011.
