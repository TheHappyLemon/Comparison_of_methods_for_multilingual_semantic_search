Cody Glass (born April 1, 1999) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL). Glass was the first-ever draft selection in Vegas Golden Knights franchise history, after he was drafted sixth overall in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. Glass was born on April 1, 1999, to father Jeff Glass, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The parents divorced in 2010 and he lived with his father alongside his brother Matthew. Glass' grandmother Judy helped support the family financially until her death in 2016. Glass played AAA ice hockey with the Winnipeg Thrashers during the 2014‚Äì15 season, recording 55 points in 40 games. He was subsequently selected by the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1st round (19th overall) in the 2014 WHL Bantam Draft, after acquiring the pick in a trade with the Calgary Hitmen. In his rookie season, Glass was chosen to compete with Team Manitoba at the 2015 Canada Winter Games. Early in the 2016‚Äì17 season, Glass quickly began rising in the draft rankings with his exceptional play. Initially rated a "C" level prospect by NHL Central Scouting in August, he was upgraded to "A" by November, indicating first-round potential. By the end of the season Glass was regarded as a top prospect of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, with scouts praising his combination of playmaking, hockey sense and hands. Glass was drafted sixth overall by the Vegas Golden Knights in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. He is the first ever player drafted by the Golden Knights. On July 16, 2017, Glass agreed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Vegas Golden Knights. Glass was invited to the Knights training camp before the 2017‚Äì18 season, however he was cut and reassigned to the Winterhawks before the final roster was announced. On March 31, Glass was named a Western Conference First Team All-Star and the Western Conference's Most Sportsmanlike Player. On April 17, 2018, Glass was assigned to the Golden Knights' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Chicago Wolves, after the Winterhawks were eliminated from the 2018 WHL playoffs. However, the Wolves were eliminated from the 2018 Calder Cup playoffs before Glass made an appearance for the team. On September 25, 2018, prior to the 2018‚Äì19 season, Glass was reassigned to the Winterhawks, where he was named team captain. While with the Winterhawks, Glass was one of seven WHL players selected by Team Canada to attend their 2019 National Junior Team Selection Camp. On March 20, Glass was named to the 2018‚Äì19 WHL First All-Star Team. After attending the Golden Knights training camp, Glass made his NHL debut in the Golden Knights' season opener against San Jose on October 2, 2019. As a result, he became the first Golden Knights draft pick to play for the team. In that game, he recorded his first career NHL goal. During the 2019‚Äì20 season, Glass was elbowed by Rangers‚Äô Brendan Lemieux who was fined $2,000 and he went through concussion protocol. On July 17, 2021, the Golden Knights traded Glass to the Nashville Predators as part of a three-team trade also involving the Philadelphia Flyers. He spent the majority of his first season in the organization with the team's minor league affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. On July 1, 2023, the Predators signed Glass to a two-year, $5 million contract extension. On March 2, 2024, Glass scored his first career hat-trick in a 5-1 win over the Colorado Avalanche. On May 5, 2023, Glass was named to Canada men's national ice hockey team at the 2023 IIHF World Championship where he recorded four assists in ten games and won a gold medal. Described as a quick-skating and mobile playmaker, Glass says he models his play after Patrice Bergeron of the Boston Bruins. Teammate Max Pacioretty said ‚ÄúHe [Glass] has the ultimate hockey tool, and that's hockey IQ and knowing where to be on the ice.‚Äù Wyman, Ted (June 12, 2017). "Behind the Glass". Winnipeg Sun.
