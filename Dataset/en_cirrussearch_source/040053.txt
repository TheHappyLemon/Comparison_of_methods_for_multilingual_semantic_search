The essential insurance companies, which belong to the VHV group are founded in 1875 and 1919 as mutual insurance companies. The "VHV" was established as a self-help institution for the construction industry in 1919. Today VHV is the market leader in the field of construction and is also known as an insurer of major projects such as the Elbphilharmonie, Düsseldorf Stadtbahn or the Reichstag building. In 1937, motor vehicle insurance was introduced at the VHV, which has developed into one of the most important lines of business today. In the 1950s, more than 24,000 companies signed an insurance policy with the VHV. This turned VHV insurance into the second largest liability insurer in Germany. In order to insure cross-border construction projects in Austria, VHV founded its subsidiary VAV in 1973. In 1991, VHV successfully established the guarantee service, which in particular allows clients of the construction industry to increase their financial scope. The "hanoverian life insurance" (in German: Hannoversche)has emerged from the Prussian Official Association in 1875 and is known as Germany's oldest direct insurer. In 1935, the VHV Life insurance also opened for people who were not Prussian officials. Each brand consists of independent companies. In 2003 both companies merged and became the VHV Group. In 2004 the special insurer VHV Lebensversicherung AG was founded. As a result of restructuring after the merger, VHV solutions GmbH was founded in 2005.

Due to the rising number of customers and employees, a new headquarter was built at VHV-Platz 1, which was completed in 2009. Since 2009 the VHV has strengthened its internationalization tendencies in order to reduce its dependency on the German insurance market. In 2011 the Wave Management AG moved to Hannover and concentrated its business activities there. Since 2012 VHV Group has had a liaison office in Turkey for 3 years, which has resulted in experience and overview regarding Turkish insurance market.
