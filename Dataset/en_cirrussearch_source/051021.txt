Nashik (/ˈnɑːʃɪk/), Marathi: [naːʃik], formerly Nasik (listen)) is a city in the northern region of the Indian state of Maharashtra. Situated on the banks of the river Godavari. The population of Nashik city is around 2.2 million and is emerging as one of the fastest-growing cities in India. Nashik is located about 165 km (103 mi) northeast of the state capital Mumbai, and about 210 km (130 mi) north of Pune. The Mumbai-Pune-Nashik region is called the "Golden Triangle of Maharashtra". With its high agricultural production, Nashik is dubbed the Napa Valley of India and the "Wine Capital of India" as more than half of India's vineyards and wineries are located here. Around 90% of all Indian wine comes from the Nashik Valley. Nashik is one of the Hindu pilgrimage sites of the Kumbh Mela, which is held every 12 years. The name, Nashik, is derived from the Sanskrit word 'nāsikā' which literally means 'nose'. According to the Ramayana, Nashik is the location on the banks of the Godavari River where Lakshmana cut the nose of the demoness Surpanakha, hence the name "Nashik." It is also known by the name Panchavati. It was known as "Gulshanabad" during the Mughal period. Nashik was known by many names. It was known as "Padmanagar" during the Satya Yuga, "Trikantak" during the Treta Yuga, "Janasthana" during the Dvapara Yuga, and finally "Navashikh" or "Nashik" during the Kali Yuga, according to Hindu traditions. Nashik is significant in mythology, history, social life, and culture. The city is located on the banks of the Godavari River, making it a sacred site for Hindus around the world. During his 14-year exile from Ayodhya, Rama, the king of Ayodhya, is said to have made Nashik his home. Nashik Tram was started from the Old Municipal Building on the main road to Nashik Road railway station around 1889. The tram served the people of Nashik for almost 44 years. The tram station was at the Main Road, and the tram reached the Nashik Road railway station via the present Main Road, Bhadrakali Market, Ghasbazar, and Phalke Road. It covered a distance of about eight to ten km, and the stretch used to be covered with dense jungle at the time. In the article ‘Nashik-then’, poet Kusumagraj has written passionately about trams. He writes, "If the carriages were full, the tram would leave. It would ring the bell and drive out of the village to the main road and then to the grass market. In the 1900s Vinayak Savarkar along with his brother founded a secret society Abhinav Bharat in Nasik Mitra Mela which was one amongst many in Maharashtra. On 21 December 1909 a member of Abhinav Bharat, Anant Kanhere a student from Aurangabad assassinated Nashik's governor A. M. T. Jackson while he was watching a play in a theatre. Kanhere was arrested on the spot and after investigation, police arrested Vinayak Savarkar and others for conspiring against the government to instigate an armed rebellion. The case was known as the "Nasik Conspiracy Case - 1910". In the court trial in Bombay, police alleged Savarkar was the brain, moving spirit and inspiration of the conspiracy extending over many years. Bombay court sentenced him to life imprisonment, and transportation to notorious Cellular Jail at Andaman; Savarkar's elder brother Babarao Savarkar also received the same punishment and others received varying degrees of imprisonment. ICS officer Jakson's assassination created a sensation in Poona, Nasik and Bombay, the case and subsequently imprisonment made Savarkar famous. In 1930, the Nashik Satyagraha was launched under the leadership of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar for the entry of Dalits in Kalaram Mandir (Temple). In 1931, a meeting of the Bombay Province Charmkar Parishad was organised in Nashik to work out the Chambhars' position concerning the Second Round Table Conference in which Babasaheb was going to participate. In 1932, Babasaheb organised his temple entry movement for the abolition of untouchability in Nashik. Nashik lies in the northern part of Maharashtra state at 584 m (1,916 ft) from the mean sea level which gives it ideal temperature variation, particularly in winters. The river Godavari originates from the Brahmagiri Mountain, Trimbakeshwar about 24 km (15 mi) from Nashik and flows through the old residential settlement, now in the central part of the city. Due to the high pollution created by factories in proximity to the city, the river was dying at an alarming rate. It has since been successfully cleaned. Nashik lies on the western edge of the Deccan Plateau, an ancient volcanic formation. Trimbakeshwar is about 30 km (19 mi) from the city, it is where from river Godavari originates. The land area of the city is about 259.13 km2 (100.05 sq mi). The city's tropical location and high altitude combine to give it a relatively mild version of a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen Aw). Temperatures rise slightly in October, but this is followed by the cool season from November to February. The cool season sees warm temperatures of around 28 °C or 82.4 °F during the day, but cool nights, with lows averaging 10 °C or 50 °F, and extremely dry air.
