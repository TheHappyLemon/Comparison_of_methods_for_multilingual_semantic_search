Old Funeral was a black/death metal band from Bergen, Norway. Old Funeral was one of the first bands to form in the Norwegian extreme metal scene, formed in 1988. By 1992, the band had already dissolved. Since the breakup, many members (such as Abbath and Demonaz of Immortal, and Varg Vikernes, in Old Funeral as Kristian Vikernes, of Burzum) are now quite famous as members of the early Norwegian black metal scene. On 15 November 2015, Old Funeral reunited to perform at Blekkmetal 2015 in Bergen, Norway.
