Beñat Intxausti Elorriaga (born 20 March 1986) is a Spanish former professional road bicycle racer, who rode professionally between 2007 and 2019 for the Nicolas Mateos, Fuji–Servetto, Euskaltel–Euskadi, Movistar Team, Team Sky and Euskadi–Murias teams. Intxausti was born in Amorebieta-Etxano, Biscay. In 2012, he won the Vuelta a Asturias and finished 10th overall in the Vuelta a España despite working for his team leader, Alejandro Valverde. In 2013, Intxausti won stage 16 in the Giro d'Italia after being part of a breakaway and later finished 8th overall. He also had the leaders' jersey for one day. In the Tour of Beijing, Intxausti won the only mountain stage and claimed the general classification victory. After five seasons with Movistar, in September 2015 Team Sky announced that Intxausti would join them in 2016 on an initial two-year contract. However, after a promising start to 2016, Intxausti's career became blighted with illness and was unable to race for extended periods. In 2019, he moved to the lower-level Euskadi–Murias team. In January 2020, he announced his retirement from cycling. 2005 1st Stage 3 Vuelta a Salamanca 2006 1st Memorial Avelino Camacho 2nd Overall Bidasoa Itzulia 1st Stage 3 5th Clásica Memorial Txuma 2007 5th Overall Tour de l'Avenir 5th La Côte Picarde 2008 8th Klasika Primavera 2009 5th Subida a Urkiola 7th Overall Vuelta a Burgos 8th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 2010 2nd Overall Tour of the Basque Country 3rd Overall Vuelta a Asturias 1st Stage 3b (ITT) 5th GP Miguel Induráin 7th Trofeo Deia 10th Overall Critérium International 2011 4th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 5th Overall Tour de Romandie 9th Circuito de Getxo 2012 1st Overall Vuelta a Asturias 1st Points classification 10th Overall Vuelta a España 1st Stage 1 (TTT) 2013 1st Overall Tour of Beijing 1st Stage 4 4th Klasika Primavera 8th Overall Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 16 Held after Stage 7 8th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 2014 3rd Overall Tour de Pologne 6th Overall Tour de Romandie 9th Circuito de Getxo 10th Klasika Primavera 2015 Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 8 Held after Stages 8, 11–15 2nd Overall Vuelta a Castilla y León 3rd Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 3rd GP Miguel Induráin 4th Overall Critérium du Dauphiné 6th Trofeo Andratx–Mirador d'es Colomer 2016 3rd Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana "El Euskadi-Murias anuncia para 2019 una plantilla de 20 ciclistas" [Euskadi-Murias announces for 2019 a roster of 20 cyclists].
