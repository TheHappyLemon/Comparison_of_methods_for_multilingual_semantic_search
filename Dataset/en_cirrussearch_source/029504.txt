Rosice (Czech pronunciation: [ˈrosɪtsɛ]; German: Rossitz) is a town in Brno-Country District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 6,700 inhabitants. Rosice is located about 18 kilometres (11 mi) southwest of Brno. It lies in the Boskovice Furrow. The Bobrava River flows through the town. The first written mention of Rosice is from 1259. The most prominent owners of the estate were the Zierotins, who acquired it in 1562 and built a castle here. In 1907, Rosice was promoted to a town by Franz Joseph I of Austria. The local football club FC Slovan Rosice plays in the Moravian-Silesian Football League (3rd tier of the Czech football league system). Rosice Castle is the main sight in the town. It was built in the Renaissance style in 1570–1579 and replaced a Gothic medieval castle from the 13th century. It is surrounded by a large park. Nowadays a part of the castle is open to the public and another part houses a library and a cultural centre. The parish Church of Saint Martin is the oldest monument in Rosice. The Romanesque windows in its 34 metres (112 ft)-high tower indicate that the building dates probably from the 12th century. It was rebuilt several times. It has one Gothic and one Renaissance chapel. The interior has its current look since the 18th century.
