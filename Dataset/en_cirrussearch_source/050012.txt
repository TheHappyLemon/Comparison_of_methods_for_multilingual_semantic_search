He is also a citizen of Russia and rode as a Russian until 2 March 2022. Sivakov is the son of Russian former cyclists Alexei Sivakov and Aleksandra Koliaseva. He was born in Italy, but grew up in Soueich, Haute Garonne in France. Sivakov started competing for Russia. In March 2022, he changed his cycling nationality to France, due to his opposition to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In August 2017 it was announced that Sivakov would turn professional with Team Sky, joining the team on a three-year contract from 2018. In August 2018, he was named in the startlist for the 2018 Vuelta a España. In April 2019, Sivakov won Stage 2 of the Tour of the Alps, his first professional victory.

Sivakov finished ahead of Jai Hindley of Team Sunweb on the sixth stage and overtook the Australian by two seconds, thanks to time bonuses.
