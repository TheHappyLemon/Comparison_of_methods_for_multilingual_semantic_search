Kilingi-Nõmme is a town in Pärnu County, southwestern Estonia. It is the administrative centre of Saarde Parish. It is located on the intersection of Valga–Uulu (Valga–Pärnu, no. 6) and Tartu–Viljandi–Kilingi-Nõmme (no. 92) roads, about 11 km (7 mi) from the Estonian border with Latvia. The settlement was first mentioned in 1560, when a manor named Ovelgunne (also Kurkund) belonging to the Schilling family was established. In 1789 a tavern was opened in the nearby Nõmme farmstead. Hence the name "Kilingi-Nõmme", Kilingi derived from the Schilling surname. In the 1870s when most of the manor's land was handed out to Orthodox believers, the settlement started to develop faster. Local congregation was established in 1845, and a parish school three years later. Kilingi-Nõmme was then the centre of the surrounding Saarde Parish. After the establishment of sawmill, flour mill and spinning factory, Kilingi-Nõmme gained the borough rights in 1919 and eventually the town rights on 1 May 1938. On 20 April 1937, a fire in an elementary school killed 17 students and injured 50. In 1896, a Pärnu–Mõisaküla–Rūjiena–Valga narrow gauge railway (750 mm (2 ft 5+1⁄2 in)) was built, the station in Kilingi-Nõmme was opened in 1917, before that the nearest station was Woltveti 1.7 km (1.1 mi) southeast in Tihemetsa. In 1975 the narrow gauge railway was closed and a new 1,520 mm (4 ft 11+27⁄32 in) Russian gauge railway (1,524 mm (5 ft)) was opened in 1981 as part of the Tallinn–Pärnu–Riga railway. Eventually this was also closed in 2000 and dismantled in 2008. After Estonia regained its independence in 1991, Kilingi-Nõmme served as a sovereign municipality, but merged with neighbouring Saarde and Tali parishes in 2005, and became the centre of the new Saarde Parish.
