The 1958 Ice Hockey World Championships were held between February 28 and March 9, 1958, in Oslo, Norway at the Jordal Amfi arena. The Whitby Dunlops represented Canada, winning the World Championship for the 17th time. The Soviets lost the final game to the Canadians 4–2, settling for both silver and their fourth European Championship. Scoring leader Connie Broden is the only player to win the Stanley Cup and the World Championship in the same year, having played on the Montreal Canadiens' championship team.
