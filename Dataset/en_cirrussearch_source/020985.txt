The Scombrinae are a subfamily of ray-finned bony fishes in the family Scombridae. Of the 51 species in the Scombridae, 50 are in Scombrinae – with the sole exception being the butterfly kingfish, which is placed in the monospecific subfamily Gasterochismatinae. The Scombrinae, therefore, comprise 50 extant species in 14 genera, grouped into four tribes: Subfamily Scombrinae Tribe Scombrini – mackerels Genus Rastrelliger Genus Scomber Tribe Scomberomorini – Spanish mackerels Genus Acanthocybium Genus Grammatorcynus Genus Scomberomorus Tribe Sardini – bonitos Genus Sarda Genus Cybiosarda Genus Gymnosarda Genus Orcynopsis Tribe Thunnini – tunas Genus Allothunnus Genus Auxis Genus Euthynnus Genus Katsuwonus Genus Thunnus Mackerel as food "Scombrinae".
