The Switzerland women's national football team represents Switzerland in international women's football. Playing their first match in 1972, Switzerland did not enter their first major tournament until 2015, playing the World Cup, and then managed to qualify for Euro 2017, Euro 2022 and the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Switzerland qualified for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada by winning their qualifying group. It was the first time that Switzerland participated in a women's World Cup, and the first time both the men's team and women's team qualified for a World Cup simultaneously. At the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, Switzerland was drawn into Group C with Japan, Cameroon and Ecuador. They secured a 10–1 victory over Ecuador, but lost 1–0 to Japan and 2–1 to Cameroon. Switzerland finished third in their group, but they were one of the top four third-place finishers and advanced to the knockout round. In the Round of 16, Switzerland lost 1–0 to the hosts, Team Canada and were eliminated. Switzerland qualified for the European Championship for the first time in 2017. They were placed in Group C alongside France, Austria and Iceland. They lost to Austria 1–0, but then rebounded to beat Iceland 2–1. Switzerland went into their final group match against France needing a win in order to advance to the knockout stage. Switzerland led for much of the match after Ana-Maria Crnogorčević scored in the 19th minute, but Camille Abily scored the equalizer for France in the 76th minute while the Blues were playing at a numerical disadvantage, and the match ended in a 1–1 draw, as a result Switzerland finished third in their group and did not advance. At Euro 2022, Switzerland was again in Group C with Sweden, the Netherlands and Portugal as opponents. Switzerland left the competition in the first round, with a draw (2–2 against Portugal despite two goals scored in the first five minutes of the game) and two defeats against the favorites of the group (1–2 against Sweden and 1–4 against the Dutch title holders, having conceded the last three Dutch goals in the last 10 minutes of the game). In the 2023 World Cup qualifiers, Switzerland ended their campaign by winning 15–0 against Moldova, setting a new record for goals in a match for the team. At the 2023 World Cup, Switzerland finished first in the low-scoring group A. In the next round they were defeated 1–5 by Spain, the eventual champions. In 2025, Switzerland will host the UEFA Women's Euro for the very first time and have qualified automatically as host. Switzerland has never qualified for the Olympic games.
