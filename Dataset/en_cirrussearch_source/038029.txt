Miroslav Filip (27 October 1928 – 27 April 2009) was a Czech chess grandmaster. Filip was awarded the title of International Master in 1953, and the Grandmaster title in 1955. Filip represented Czechoslovakia in 12 consecutive Chess Olympiads from Helsinki 1952 to Nice 1974, playing 194 games with the overall result (+62–28=104). Filip twice qualified for the Candidates Tournament, which is the tournament to choose a world championship challenger. In 1955 Filip placed seventh in the Gothenburg Interzonal, qualifying for the Candidates, which was held in Amsterdam the following year. He placed eighth out of ten players. (See World Chess Championship 1957.) In 1962 Filip placed fifth (out of 23 players) in the Stockholm Interzonal. This qualified him for the Candidates tournament in Curaçao, where he tied for last place out of eight players. (See World Chess Championship 1963.) Filip won the Czechoslovak Chess Championship three times: in 1950 at Gottwaldov, in 1952 at Tatranska Lomnica, and in 1954 in Prague. He played in the European Team Chess Championship twice, winning an individual gold in 1970 for the best score and a bronze in 1977 for the third best score.
