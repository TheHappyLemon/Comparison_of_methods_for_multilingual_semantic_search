Christián Jaroš (born 2 April 1996) is a Slovak professional ice hockey defenceman for Severstal Cherepovets of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Jaroš was drafted 139th overall in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft by the Ottawa Senators. Jaros made his Swedish Hockey League debut playing with Luleå HF during the 2014–15 SHL season. On 30 May 2017, Jaroš was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract by the Ottawa Senators. He made his NHL debut on 10 October, against Vancouver Canucks but spent the rest of the season with their American Hockey League (AHL) team, the Belleville Senators. Despite beginning the 2018–19 season in the AHL, Jaroš was recalled to the NHL and on 21 November 2018, scored his first career NHL goal in a 6–4 loss to the Minnesota Wild. On 27 January 2021, Jaroš was traded by the Senators to the San Jose Sharks. He made his debut for the Sharks on 6 April, in a 5–1 loss to the Anaheim Ducks. His first point came four days later, assisting Dylan Gambrell for the first Sharks goal, in a 4–2 defeat by the Los Angeles Kings. On 26 July 2021, Jaroš was traded by San Jose to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for Nick Merkley. In the following 2021–22 season, he remained on the Devils roster, serving in a depth defenceman role. He appeared in 11 games for the Devils before he was placed on waivers and re-assigned to AHL affiliate, the Utica Comets, at the NHL trade deadline, on 21 March 2022. After failing to report to the AHL, Jaroš was placed on unconditional waivers in order to mutually terminate the remainder of his contract with the Devils on 24 March. On 9 June 2022, Jaroš signed one-year contract with Avangard Omsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). In the 2022–23 season, Jaroš featured in 24 games from the blueline for Avangard Omsk, registering three goals and six assists. On 23 December, Jaroš was traded by Avangard Omsk to CSKA Moscow in exchange for Dmitri Alexeyev. He won the Gagarin Cup in 2023 with SKA Moscow, although missed the playoffs due to injury. In the off-season, Jaroš was announced to have left CSKA on 1 July 2023. On 19 October, his KHL rights were traded to Severstal Cherepovets. Jaroš is a cousin of Erik Černák, who plays for the Tampa Bay Lightning and won a Stanley Cup in 2020 and 2021. "2015's been a whirlwind for Cehlarik and Jaros".
