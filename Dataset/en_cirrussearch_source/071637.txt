The Siberian Turkic or Northeastern Common Turkic languages, are a sub-branch of the Turkic language family. The following table is based upon the classification scheme presented by Lars Johanson (1998). All languages of the branch combined have approximately 750,000–1 million native and second language speakers, with most widely spoken members being Yakut (c. 500,000 speakers), Tuvan (c. 250,000 speakers) and Northern Altai (c. 57,000 speakers). Despite their usual English name, two major Turkic languages spoken in Siberia, Siberian Tatar and Southern Altai, are not classified as Siberian Turkic, but are rather part of the Kipchak subgroup. Alexander Vovin (2017) notes that Tofa and other Siberian Turkic languages, especially Sayan Turkic, have Yeniseian loanwords. Lars Johanson (1998) "The History of Turkic".
