Year 1245 (MCCXLV) was a common year starting on Sunday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. Winter – Siege of Jaén: Castilian forces under King Ferdinand III (the Saint) besiege the Moorish-held city of Jaén. During the siege Moorish knights sally out and manage to capture a Castilian supply caravan. Meanwhile, Ferdinand tries to launch attacks on the various city gates, but all are ineffective. In witness of the toll taken by war and fiscal pressure in the Kingdom of Castile, the region of Segovia is described this year as depopulated and sterile. King Henry III starts the work of rebuilding Westminster Abbey, as a tribute to Edward the Confessor. April – Egyptian forces under As-Salih Ayyub besiege the city of Damascus. After six months, As-Salih Ismail, ruler of Damascus, surrenders to Ayyub in return for a vassal-principality, consisting of Baalbek and the Hauran. Ayyub is awarded the title of sultan by Caliph Al-Musta'sim in Baghdad. February 21 – Thomas, bishop of Turku (modern Finland), is granted resignation by Pope Innocent IV.
