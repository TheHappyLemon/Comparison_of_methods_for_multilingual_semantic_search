71°20′S 11°0′W﻿ / ﻿71.333°S 11.000°W﻿ / -71.333; -11.000 Quar Ice Shelf is the ice shelf between Cape Norvegia and Sorasen Ridge along the coast of Queen Maud Land. It was mapped by the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE) (1949–1952). The ice shelf was named after Leslie Quar, a British radio mechanic and electrician with NBSAE, who drowned when the weasel (track-driven vehicle) in which he was riding drove over the edge of this ice shelf on 24 February 1951. The NBSAE established Maudheim Station about 1 mile south of Norsel Iceport.  This article incorporates public domain material from "Quar Ice Shelf". Geographic Names Information System.
