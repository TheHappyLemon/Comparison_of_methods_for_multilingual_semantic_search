Junichi Inamoto (稲本 潤一, Inamoto Jun'ichi, born 18 September 1979) is a Japanese professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Nankatsu SC. He is a retired international for the Japan national team. Inamoto was born in Kagoshima Prefecture. He played for Japanese club Gamba Osaka during his last year of high school, signing with the club in 1997. In April of that year, at the age of 17, he made his debut in the 1997 J.League season, making him the youngest player in the J.League (at that time). He played for Gamba until summer 2001 and played 118 matches in the J1 League. He was then one of many high-profile transfers of Asian players to Europe, signing with Arsenal of the Premier League. Inamoto scored two goals for the Japan national team at the 2002 World Cup, but had already been released by Arsenal shortly before the tournament began. He was then signed by Fulham on a long-term loan deal from Gamba Osaka. Initially he settled well at the London club, garnering good notices as a tough-tackling midfielder with an eye for a spectacular goal. He became a fan favourite quickly, scoring four goals over the two legs of Fulham's Intertoto Cup final win against Bologna, scoring once in the first leg and a hat trick in the second. Other notable goals he scored in his time for Fulham include goals against Tottenham Hotspur, Sunderland, Middlesbrough and also in the 3–1 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in October 2003. He also scored in the FA Cup against Everton which commentator Barry Davies described as "a Japanese peach".[citation needed] Inamoto was also described as "bigger than Beckham" by the Japanese media. However, he sustained a fractured tibia in an international friendly against England, and returned to Gamba Osaka to do promotional work. Fulham were interested in signing him once more, but concerns remained over his recovery from injury. Inamoto signed with West Bromwich Albion for a decidedly small £200,000 transfer fee, which was only to be paid once he had made an appearance for the Midlands club. However, Gary Megson departed as West Bromwich Albion manager shortly afterwards, and successor Bryan Robson was unsure of the player. Inamoto was loaned to Cardiff City for the latter part of the 2004–05 season, and impressed, being recalled to play a role in West Brom's survival campaign in the Premiership. In 2005–06 he was a regular in the West Brom side, and was called up to the Japan squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the first Albion player to play in the tournament for 20 years.[citation needed] While at West Brom Inamoto scored once, an extra time winner in a League Cup tie against former club Fulham on 25 October 2005. On 31 August 2006, he signed for Galatasaray. On 29 May 2007, it was revealed that he signed a two-year contract with German club Eintracht Frankfurt, joining on a free transfer. Inamoto was presented in a press conference joining fellow Japanese striker Naohiro Takahara in Frankfurt and was released on 30 May 2009. On 19 June 2009, French Ligue 1 side Rennes announced that Inamoto had signed a contract with them. Inamoto signed for J1 League club Kawasaki Frontale on 11 January 2010 in a move back to his homeland. He played for Frontale for 5 seasons. He left at the end of the 2014 season. Inamoto then subsequently featured for Consadole Sapporo (later Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo) in the J2 League. Consadole won the 2016 season and was promoted to J1. However he could only play single-digit matches every season from the 2016 season onward. He resigned at the end of the 2018 season. In 2019, he signed with J3 League club SC Sagamihara.
