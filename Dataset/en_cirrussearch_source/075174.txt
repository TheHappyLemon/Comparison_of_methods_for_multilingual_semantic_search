Country calling codes, country dial-in codes, international subscriber dialing (ISD) codes, or most commonly, telephone country codes are telephone number prefixes for reaching telephone subscribers in foreign countries or areas via international telecommunication networks. Country codes are defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in ITU-T standards E.123 and E.164. The prefixes enable international direct dialing (IDD). Country codes constitute the international telephone numbering plan. They are used only when dialing a telephone number in a country or world region other than the caller's. Country codes are dialed before the national telephone number, but require at least one additional prefix, the international call prefix which is an exit code from the national numbering plan to the international one. In most countries, this prefix is 00, an ITU recommendation; it is 011 in the countries of the North American Numbering Plan while a minority of countries use other prefixes. The nine world zones are generally organized geographically, with exceptions for political and historical alignment. Zone 1 uses an integrated numbering plan; four digits (1xxx) determine the area served in Canada, the United States and its territories, and much of the Caribbean. Zone 2 uses two 2-digit codes (20, 27) and eight sets of 3-digit codes (21x–26x, 28x, 29x), mostly to serve Africa, but also Aruba, Faroe Islands, Greenland and British Indian Ocean Territory. Zones 3 and 4 use sixteen 2-digit codes (30–34, 36, 39–41, 43–49) and four sets of 3-digit codes (35x, 37x, 38x, 42x) to serve Europe. Zone 5 uses eight 2-digit codes (51–58) and two sets of 3-digit codes (50x, 59x) to serve South and Central America. Zone 6 uses seven 2-digit codes (60–66) and three sets of 3-digit codes (67x–69x) to serve Southeast Asia and Oceania. Zone 7 uses an integrated numbering plan; two digits (7x) determine the area served: Russia or Kazakhstan. Zone 8 uses four 2-digit codes (81, 82, 84, 86) and four sets of 3-digit codes (80x, 85x, 87x, 88x) to serve East Asia, South Asia and special services. 83x and 89x are unallocated. Zone 9 uses seven 2-digit codes (90–95, 98) and three sets of 3-digit codes (96x, 97x, 99x) to serve the Middle East, West Asia, Central Asia, parts of South Asia and Eastern Europe. World zones are organized principally, but only approximately, by geographic location. Exceptions exist for political and historical alignments. NANP members are assigned three-digit numbering plan area (NPA) codes under the common country prefix 1, shown in the format 1 (NPA). 1 North American Numbering Plan 1 –  United States, including United States territories: 1 (340) –  United States Virgin Islands 1 (670) –  Northern Mariana Islands 1 (671) –  Guam 1 (684) –  American Samoa 1 (787, 939) –  Puerto Rico 1 –  Canada Caribbean nations, Dutch and British Overseas Territories: 1 (242) –  Bahamas 1 (246) –  Barbados 1 (264) –  Anguilla 1 (268) –  Antigua and Barbuda 1 (284) –  British Virgin Islands 1 (345) –  Cayman Islands 1 (441) –  Bermuda 1 (473) –  Grenada 1 (649) –  Turks and Caicos Islands 1 (658, 876) –  Jamaica 1 (664) –  Montserrat 1 (721) –  Sint Maarten 1 (758) –  Saint Lucia 1 (767) –  Dominica 1 (784) –  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 1 (809, 829, 849) –  Dominican Republic 1 (868) –  Trinidad and Tobago 1 (869) –  Saint Kitts and Nevis (but also Aruba, Faroe Islands, Greenland and British Indian Ocean Territory) 20 –  Egypt 210 – unassigned 211 –  South Sudan 212 –  Morocco (including Western Sahara) 213 –  Algeria 214 – unassigned 215 – unassigned 216 –  Tunisia 217 – unassigned 218 –  Libya 219 – unassigned 220 –  Gambia 221 –  Senegal 222 –  Mauritania 223 –  Mali 224 –  Guinea 225 –  Ivory Coast 226 –  Burkina Faso 227 –  Niger 228 –  Togo 229 –  Benin 230 –  Mauritius 231 –  Liberia 232 –  Sierra Leone 233 –  Ghana 234 –  Nigeria 235 –  Chad 236 –  Central African Republic 237 –  Cameroon 238 –  Cape Verde 239 –  São Tomé and Príncipe 240 –  Equatorial Guinea 241 –  Gabon 242 –  Republic of the Congo 243 –  Democratic Republic of the Congo 244 –  Angola 245 –  Guinea-Bissau 246 –  British Indian Ocean Territory 247 –  Ascension Island 248 –  Seychelles 249 –  Sudan 250 –  Rwanda 251 –  Ethiopia 252 –  Somalia (including  Somaliland) 253 –  Djibouti 254 –  Kenya 255 –  Tanzania 255 (24) –  Zanzibar, in place of never-implemented 259 256 –  Uganda 257 –  Burundi 258 –  Mozambique 259 – unassigned (was intended for People's Republic of Zanzibar but never implemented – see 255 Tanzania) 260 –  Zambia 261 –  Madagascar 262 –  Réunion 262 (269,639) –  Mayotte (formerly at 269 Comoros) 263 –  Zimbabwe 264 –  Namibia (formerly 27 (6x) as South West Africa) 265 –  Malawi 266 –  Lesotho 267 –  Botswana 268 –  Eswatini 269 –  Comoros (formerly assigned to Mayotte, now at 262) 27 –  South Africa 28x – unassigned (reserved for country code expansion) 290 –  Saint Helena 290 (8) –  Tristan da Cunha 291 –  Eritrea 292 – unassigned 293 – unassigned 294 – unassigned 295 – unassigned (formerly assigned to San Marino, now at 378) 296 – unassigned 297 –  Aruba 298 –  Faroe Islands 299 –  Greenland Some of the larger countries were assigned two-digit codes to compensate for their usually longer domestic numbers.

When three-digit codes share a common leading pair, the two-digit code is unassigned, being ambiguous (denoted by "ambig."). Unassigned codes are denoted by a dash (—). Countries are identified by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes; codes for non-geographic services are denoted by two asterisks (**).
