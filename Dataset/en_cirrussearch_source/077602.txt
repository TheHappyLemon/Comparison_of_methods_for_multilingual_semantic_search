Estonian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, English, German and Belarusian language versions of "Dziesma par laimi" was also recorded by the artists, with the Belarusian version being recorded together with 2004 Belarusian Eurovision entrant Aleksandra and Konstantin on 15 April. It was announced that the competition's format would be expanded to include a semi-final in 2004.
