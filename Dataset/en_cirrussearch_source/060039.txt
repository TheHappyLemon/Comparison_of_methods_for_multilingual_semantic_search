The National Ski Jumping Centre (Chinese: 国家跳台滑雪中心; pinyin: Guójiā Tiàotái Huáxuě Zhōngxīn), nicknamed Snow Ruyi (Chinese: 雪如意; pinyin: Xuě Rúyì), is a Chinese ski jumping hill in Chongli District, Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, China, opened in 2021. It is located 180 kilometres (110 mi) northwest from Beijing and hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics in ski jumping and Nordic combined. After the Olympics, the facilities shall serve as a national training centre, potentially also including junior hills to be built. Hill was designed by Zhiang Li, and got its widely known name after "Ruyi", a traditional Chinese ornament symbolizing good luck. Beside summer ski jumping on plastic, the flat finish (jump out) area of the hill stadium, with grandstand capacity for 6,000 people, will be also used as a football (soccer) pitch in the summer. In 2017, construction started and was planned to be completed in 2019. But due to the unconventional location in between two hills, the elaborate works were done in November 2020. The Olympic ski jumping stadium was then inaugurated with a celebration on 21 December 2020. One month later, on 19 January 2021, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping visited the Olympic sports facilities.
