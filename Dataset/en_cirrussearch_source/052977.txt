Tvøroyrar Bóltfelag is a Faroese professional football club from Tvøroyri, currently playing in the Betrideildin, the top tier of Faroese football. TB Tvøroyri is the oldest football club in the Faroe Islands, and also one of the oldest in the Danish Realm, in which the Faroe Islands are a self-governing country. After the end of the 2016 season, it was decided on 15 December 2016 that the three clubs of the island Suðuroy, which are TB Tvøroyri, FC Suðuroy and Royn Hvalba would merge into a new club for the 2017 season. The merger will not be complete until 2018 and the name will be all three names together for the 2017 season: TB/FC Suðuroy/Royn. The three clubs have not been dissolved yet, they continue separately for the children's and women's teams. In 2017 it will only be the men's teams which will play for the new cooperation. In Faroese the new team is referred to as Suðuroyarliðið (the Suðuroy-team). The first head coach for the Suðuroy-team is the Scottish manager Maurice Ross. After two years the three clubs ended the co-operation and TB Tvøroyri continued to play with their licence which was for the Faroese Premier League. In 2020 TB became a member of the Club of Pioneers, a network of oldest football clubs. Faroe Islands Premier League: 7 1943, 1949, 1951, 1976, 1977, 1980, 1987 Faroe Islands Cup: 5 1956, 1958, 1960, 1961, 1977 1. deild: 4 1948, 2001, 2004, 2014 As of 2 August 2023.

TB Tvøroyri used to play their home matches on Sevmýri Stadium, which is located in the eastern part of the town, near Froðba. But in 2011, the football field there was in such a bad shape, that the Faroe Islands Football Association could not allow any adult teams to play there. TB Tvøroyri therefore arranged with one of the neighbour villages, Hvalba, that they would play their matches there in 2011. On 17 November 2011, they started to build a new football stadium in Trongisvágur, just west of the sports hall, the place is called við Stórá (which means By Grand River). They worked very hard to get the new home field ready for the club's 120 years anniversary on 13 May 2012 and they made it. The new football field was ready in mid April, but it was not recognized for matches in the men's best division for the match against B36 Tórshavn as they had hoped for, the reason for this was that there were no seats yet, and the minimum demand for seats is 300. TB therefore played their home match against B36 Tórshavn in Vágur on 15 April 2012. They worked hard in order to get at least 300 seats around the football field, and that work finished on the Faroese flagday on 25 April 2012. Two days later on 27 April 2012, TB's new football field við Stórá was finally approved for matches in the men's best division. The football field officially opened on 29 April 2012. There was an opening ceremony just before TB played against ÍF Fuglafjørður, at the ceremony there were speeches by Andre Dalfoss, president of TB Tvøroyri and by Jens Johannesen, Chairman of Cultural Affairs of Tvøroyri Municipality and there was music by Tvøroyri Brass Band (Tvøroyrar Hornorkestur). Just a few minutes before the match started one of the former players of TB Tvøroyri Mr. Kristian Olsen, who at this time was 88 years old, got the honour to kick the first ball. TB Tvøroyri won this first match 1–0, the goal was scored by the Serbian player Dmitrije Janković.
