Žirovnice (Czech pronunciation: [ˈʒɪrovɲɪtsɛ]; German: Serownitz) is a town in Pelhřimov District in the Vysočina Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 3,100 inhabitants. The villages of Cholunná, Litkovice, Stranná, Štítné, Vlčetín and Žirov are administrative parts of Žirovnice. Žirovnice is located about 19 kilometres (12 mi) south of Pelhřimov and 32 km (20 mi) southwest of Jihlava. It lies in the Křemešník Highlands. The small river of Žirovnička flows through the town. The area is rich in small fishponds. The town was built around a castle of the same name. The first written mention of Žirovnice is from 1358. Žirovnice was traditionally town of weavers, but in 1863, manufacturing of buttons from nacre was introduced. In the 1940s, nearly 100 nacre-processing manufactures existed in the small town. After Communists seized power in 1948, these manufactures were nationalized and transformed into one company, which still exists. Main sights are the Žirovnice Castle and Church of Saints Philip and James. In the castle there is a museum of button-manufacturing and nacre-processing.
