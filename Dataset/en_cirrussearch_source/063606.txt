Members Only was an American hip hop collective from Broward County, Florida, formed in 2014. It was originally only a duo consisting of Jahseh Onfroy (XXXTentacion) and Stokeley Goulbourne (Ski Mask the Slump God) after the two met in a juvenile detention center. It closely associated with another collective named Very Rare, and members of both collectives also refer to themselves as VR All-Stars. Following the release of their fourth project, Members Only, Vol. 4, the collective has gone on an indefinite hiatus, with some of its most prominent members such as Craig Xen and Wifisfuneral exiting the group. 3 main members of the group have passed away: founding member XXXTentacion died on June 18, 2018 at the age of 20, due to an apparent robbery which resulted in his murder. All four perpetrators involved have been found guilty and sentenced, with three of them receiving life sentences without parole. On May 16, 2019, Khaed, a producer for the group, died due to ongoing heart complications at the age of 26. On April 24, 2022, former member Tablez died from an accidental drug overdose.
