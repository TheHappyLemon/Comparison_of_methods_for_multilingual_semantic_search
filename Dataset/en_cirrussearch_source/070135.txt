Jõgeva (German: Laisholm) is a small town in Estonia with a population of around 5000 people. It is the capital of Jõgeva Parish and Jõgeva County. Jõgeva was first mentioned in 1599 as Jagiwa manor, being established only recently on the lands of the same named village by the orders of the Polish king. During the Polish reign in Estonia (1582–1622) it was part of Laiuse starostwo, which became Laiuse fief during Swedish rule (1622–1721). In 1756, Jõgeva manor became the property of Gotthard Johann von Manteuffel (1690–1763) and remained in the family of von Manteuffel until 1919 when it was nationalized by the government. In 1876, a railway station, named Laisholm after the manor, was established near the village of Jõgeva. The owner of Jõgeva manor, Ernst Gotthard von Manteuffel (1844–1922), started renting out land around the railway station in 1903. After that, the village grew quickly. On October 13, 1919, Jõgeva became a borough and on May 1, 1938, a town. During the Second World War nearly 60% of the town was destroyed. During the Soviet occupation of Estonia Jõgeva became an important administrative center with several big industries. Many new administrative, commercial and residential buildings were erected at that time. Jõgeva is situated on the right shore of Pedja River which flows through the city from north to south. Parallel with the river is the Tallinn–Tartu railway line. The major cities Tartu and Tallinn are respectively 51 and 154 kilometres (96 miles) from Jõgeva, both connected through railway as well as through highways. Jõgeva is located between big drumlins. The hill of Laiuse is located east from the town. River Pedja passes through the town. The town has Humid continental climate (Dfb). Winters are usually snowy and cold. It is known as the coldest place in Estonia with the lowest temperature of −43.5 °C (−46.3 °F). Summers are mild and often humid, some days the maximum can reach 30°C. Thunder season starts in April and ends usually in the end of October. In July Jõgevatreff, an annual bikers reunion takes place. The culmination of the event is the parade of the bikers through the town. In August, the annual Garlic Festival is held. Jõgeva is also regarded as the headquarters of the Estonian Santa Claus.
