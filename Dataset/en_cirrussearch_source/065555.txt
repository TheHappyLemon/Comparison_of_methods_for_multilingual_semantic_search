The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine (Ukrainian: Головне управління розвідки Міністерства оборони України, romanized: Holovne upravlinnja rozvidky Ministerstva oborony Ukrajiny, HUR MOU) is the military intelligence service of the Ukrainian government. It is an agency of the Ministry of Defence, not the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Since 2016, the owl has been the symbol of the HUR (at the same time, the bat – a prey animal of the owls – is the symbol of the Spetsnaz GRU), the owl hovers over a map of the world and stabs a sword from the sky at a blackened Russia. The Russian Federation was outraged, calling this a provocation. At first, the motto of the HUR was "Statehood, Professionalism, Decency", then from 2016 onwards the agency's motto is "The wise will rule the Stars" (Latin: Sapiens Dominabitur Astris), an allusion to the motto of the hostile Spetsnaz GRU ("Only the stars are above us"). The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine conducts its activity in the military, political, technical, economic, signals, informational and environmental spheres. The major missions of the directorate are:[citation needed] Obtaining, analyzing and dissemination of the intelligence information to the senior civil and military authorities of Ukraine. Performing special tasks in order to promote the National interests and State policy of Ukraine in economic, political, military, technical, environmental and informational areas, contributing to the national defense, fostering the economic development, promoting science and technology, and protecting the State border. Participating in operations against terrorism, international organized crime, drug, arms and technologies trafficking, and illegal migration. Counteracting the external threats that can affect the National security of Ukraine, lives and health of its citizens and the state facilities abroad. The agency was established from the existing intelligence assets of the Kyiv, Odesa and Carpathian military districts of the Soviet Armed Forces and its Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of Ukraine. The Intelligence Directorate of the General Headquarters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was established in February 1992. Based on a presidential decree issued on September 7, 1992, the Strategic Military Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence was created. The existence of two separate agencies with similar responsibilities, and reporting to different authorities, hampered the development of an effective military intelligence system. On July 6, 1993, the Decree of the President of Ukraine ordered the merging of the two agencies to form the Main Military Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence. It was renamed the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, or Defence Intelligence of Ukraine (DIU) for short, on April 4, 1994. On March 22, 2001, the Ukrainian parliament (Rada) ratified the Law of Ukraine "On Intelligence Agencies of Ukraine". The HUR MOU was given the status of special government authority. In 2016, President Petro Poroshenko changed the HUR emblem. It was now an owl holding a sword over Russia with the new motto "The wise will rule over the stars".[failed verification] Moscow was outraged by the new emblem. On August 18, 2021, HUR special forces moved on Il-76MDs from the 25th Transport Aviation Brigade of the Ukrainian Air Force and flew to Kabul with the mission of evacuating citizens of Ukraine and foreigners during the 2021 Kabul airlift. In total, the aircraft of the brigade made six flights and transported more than 700 citizens of different countries. Special forces went to Kabul three times a day to find and bring citizens who were to be evacuated to the Kabul airport. On September 20, 2023, CNN reported that Ukrainian special forces were likely behind multiple attacks on Wagner-backed Rapid Support Forces (RSF) forces in Sudan, using DJI Mavic 3 first-person view (FPV) drones. In May 2023, HUR Chief Kyrylo Budanov vowed to “destroy Russian war criminals anywhere in the world, wherever they are.” In March 2024, reports confirmed that HUR commandos from the "Timur" unit were actively fighting Wagner and RSF in Sudan. The HUR has an executive office and several agency-wide functions, and five major directorates and departments consisting of the following:[citation needed] Directorates: Strategic Intelligence Directorate Armed Forces General Staff Intelligence Support Directorate Information Support Directorate Personnel Policy Directorate Logistic Directorate Departments: Internal Security Department Planning Department Automation and Communication Department Economic and Finance Department Information and state secret protection Department Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the only field reconnaissance unit of the HUR was a special unit subordinated to the Directorate's 4th Special Intelligence Service (4-та Служба спеціальної розвідки):[citation needed] 10th Separate Special Purpose Unit [uk] (10-й окремий загін спеціального призначення, Military Unit А2245), based in Rybalskyi Peninsula, Kyiv 3 operational companies – 1st – 3rd Special Purpose Company (1 – 3 сотня спеціального призначення) As of 2024, the units subordinate to the HUR include: Reconnaissance units: 49th Reconnaissance Training Center [uk] 54th Reconnaissance Battalion [uk] 74th Reconnaissance Battalion [uk] 120th Reconnaissance Battalion 129th Reconnaissance Battalion [uk] 130th Reconnaissance Battalion [uk] 131st Reconnaissance Battalion [uk] 132nd Reconnaissance Battalion [uk] 140th Reconnaissance Battalion [uk] 143rd Reconnaissance Battalion Special purpose units: 10th Special Purpose Unit "Shaman Battalion" [uk] Special Purpose Unit "Kraken" Special Purpose Unit "Artan” [uk] Special Purpose Unit "Timur" "Brotherhood" Battalion [uk] "Stuhna" Battalion [uk] Volunteer Reconnaissance Battalion "Sonechko" "Nobody" Unit "Paragon Company" Unit Special Purpose Unit "KABUL 9" [uk] Special Purpose UAV Unit "Wings" [uk] Special Purpose USV Unit "Group 13" International Legion of Defense Intelligence of Ukraine [uk] (part of the International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine) HUR MOU is legally allowed to operate based upon the following laws: The Constitution of Ukraine Verkhovna Rada Regulation "On National Security Concept of Ukraine (state policy fundamentals)", 1997 The Law of Ukraine "On Defence of Ukraine", 2000 The Law of Ukraine "On The Armed Forces of Ukraine", 2000 The Law of Ukraine "On the Intelligence agencies of Ukraine", 2001 The Law of Ukraine "Separate legislative acts of Ukraine Amendments in light of the Law of Ukraine", "About the Intelligence agencies of Ukraine" passage Presidential Decree "On the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Status" Lieutenant General Oleksandr Skipalskyi (October 16, 1992 – June 9, 1997) Born in Volyn Oblast 1945.
