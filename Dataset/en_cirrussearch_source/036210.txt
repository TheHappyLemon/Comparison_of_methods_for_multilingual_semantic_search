Voss is a Norwegian-based bottled water from the village of Vatnestrøm in Iveland municipality, Agder county. Contrary to popular belief, the water is not bottled in the municipality of Voss, which is more than 400 kilometres (250 mi) from the bottling site. It is available in both still and sparkling forms. The company's cylindrical glass bottle was designed by Neil Kraft. In some countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., VOSS still water is also packaged in plastic bottles that retain the cylindrical design. Voss is bottled by Voss of Norway AS, an American Limited Company headquartered in New York City. The water is marketed in over 50 countries,[citation needed] with a particular focus on the United States. Voss claims its manufacturing process is completely carbon neutral. In 2007, Women's Health magazine rated Voss #1 among several bottled waters. For entertainment on television, in tests sponsored by Finland's national broadcasting company, Yle, three blindfolded wine experts rated Voss water lowest of six waters tested, which included Helsinki public tap water. In 2016, Reignwood Group, a Thai-Chinese company, acquired majority control of Voss. The chairwoman of Voss is Lisa Wang and the vice chairman is John D. Shulman. In October 2010, Norway's TV 2 reported that Voss has the same source as tap water from the municipal water supply in Iveland and, contrary to Voss marketing, that this is not artesian. TV 2 stood by these claims despite Voss's objections. "Voss Water; KraftWorks NYC". KraftWorks NYC. Archived from the original on 2013-07-20. Retrieved 2012-01-23.
