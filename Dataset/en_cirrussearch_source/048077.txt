Alberto Bettiol (born 29 October 1993) is an Italian professional road racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam EF Education–EasyPost. Bettiol turned professional in 2014, with his first professional win coming at the 2019 Tour of Flanders. He competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics, in Road race, and Time trial. Born on 29 October 1993, in Poggibonsi, Tuscany, Bettiol resides in Castelfiorentino, Tuscany, Italy. Bettiol signed with Cannondale, a UCI ProTeam, for the 2014 season. He signed with Cannondale–Garmin, a UCI ProTeam, for the 2015 season. He was named in the start list for the 2016 Giro d'Italia. In June 2017, he was named in the startlist for the 2017 Tour de France. After spending the 2018 season in BMC Racing Team, he returned to his previous team (now called EF Education First Pro Cycling). After a strong performance at the Tirreno–Adriatico, most notably finishing 3rd on the second stage and 2nd on the final stage (an individual time trial), he won his first professional race at the Tour of Flanders, one of cycling's five monuments. Following a successful solo attack on the second to last climb of the race, Oude Kwaremont, he managed to keep the gap to the chasing group which included several of the pre-race favorites, including previous winners Alexander Kristoff and Peter Sagan, for the remaining 17 km. 2011 1st Time trial, UEC European Junior Road Championships 1st Overall Giro della Lunigiana 1st Points classification 1st Stages 1 & 3 2013 National Under-23 Road Championships 3rd Road race 5th Time trial 3rd Trofeo Franco Balestra 3rd Gran Premio della Liberazione 4th Overall Coupe des nations Ville Saguenay 7th Road race, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 10th Ronde Van Vlaanderen Beloften 2015 10th Gran Piemonte 2016 2nd Bretagne Classic 3rd Overall Tour de Pologne 1st Points classification 4th Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec 7th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal 10th Gran Piemonte 2017 4th Coppa Ugo Agostoni 5th Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli 6th Clásica de San Sebastián 10th E3 Harelbeke 2018 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Tirreno–Adriatico 2019 (1 pro win) 1st Tour of Flanders National Road Championships 2nd Time trial 3rd Road race 4th E3 Binckbank Classic 6th Brabantse Pijl 2020 (1) 2nd Overall Étoile de Bessèges 1st Stage 5 (ITT) 4th Strade Bianche 4th Gent–Wevelgem 2021 (1) 1st Stage 18 Giro d'Italia 2022 2nd Overall Étoile de Bessèges 5th Gran Piemonte 8th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 8th Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec 10th Grand Prix La Marseillaise Combativity award Stage 10 Tour de France 2023 (1) 1st Prologue Tour Down Under 10th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 2024 (1) 1st Milano–Torino 3rd Overall Étoile de Bessèges 5th Milan–San Remo 5th Trofeo Calvià 9th Tour of Flanders 10th Trofeo Pollença–Port d'Andratx "Team Cannondale – Garmin (TCG) – USA".
