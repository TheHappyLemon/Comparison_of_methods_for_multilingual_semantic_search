Harrington and Newell funded the development of Valve's debut product, Half-Life (1998), which Harrington also helped program. He said: "At Microsoft you always wonder, 'Is it me being successful or is it Microsoft?' But with Half-Life I knew Gabe and I had built that product and company from scratch."
