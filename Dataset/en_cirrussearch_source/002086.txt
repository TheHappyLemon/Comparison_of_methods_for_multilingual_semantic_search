"East Jesus Nowhere" is a song by American rock band Green Day. The single was released on October 19, 2009, as the third single and eighth track from their eighth album 21st Century Breakdown. The title is derived from a phrase in the 2007 film Juno. The song rebukes fundamentalist religion and was written by singer/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong after bassist Mike Dirnt attended a church service where a friend's baby was baptized. The music video was released on September 17, 2009. It shows a montage of live concert footage and pictures from their 21st Century Breakdown World Tour. The video is longer by about 30 seconds, because the bridge of the song is extended, although the studio version of the song is still used instead of a live version.[citation needed] The music video was directed by Chris Dugan and M. Douglas Silverstein. Billie Joe Armstrong – lead vocals, guitar Mike Dirnt – bass guitar, backing vocals Tré Cool – drums, percussion 17 min 25 sec ago. (September 25, 2009).
