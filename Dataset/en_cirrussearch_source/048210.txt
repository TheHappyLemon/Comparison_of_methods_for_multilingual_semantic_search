The Isle of Man TT or Tourist Trophy races are an annual motorcycle racing event run on the Isle of Man in May and June of most years since its inaugural race in 1907. The event begins on the UK Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May and runs for thirteen days. It is often called one of the most dangerous racing events in the world as many competitors have died. The Isle of Man TT is run in a time-trial format on public roads closed to the public by an Act of Tynwald. The event consists of one week of practice and qualifying sessions followed by one week of racing. It was a tradition, perhaps started by racing competitors in the early 1920s, for spectators to tour the Snaefell Mountain Course on motorcycles during the Isle of Man TT on 'Mad Sunday', an informal and unofficial event held on the Sunday between Practice Week and Race Week. In 2022, race organizers announced that beginning in 2023, racing would take place on Sunday after practices to allow visitors to see more events, marking the end of Mad Sunday. The first Isle of Man TT race was held on Tuesday 28 May 1907 and was named the International Auto-Cycle Tourist Trophy. The event was organised by the Auto-Cycle Club over 10 laps of the Isle of Man St John's Short Course of 15 miles 1,470 yards for road-legal 'touring' motorcycles with exhaust silencers, saddles, pedals and mudguards. From 1911, the Isle of Man TT transferred to the much longer Snaefell Mountain Course of 37.40 miles (60.19 km) (current length 37.73 miles (60.72 km)). Its elevation goes from near sea-level to 1,300 feet (400 m). The race programme developed from a single race with two classes for the 1907 Isle of Man TT, expanding in 1911 to two individual races for the 350cc Junior TT motor-cycles and the Blue Riband event the 500cc Senior TT race. The race did not take place from 1915 to 1919 due to the First World War. It resumed in 1920. A 250cc Lightweight TT race was added to the Isle of Man TT programme in 1922, followed by a Sidecar TT race in 1923. There was no racing on the Isle of Man between 1940 and 1945 due to the Second World War. It recommenced with the Manx Grand Prix in 1946 and the Isle of Man TT in 1947, with a greatly expanded format that included the new Clubman's TT races. The Isle of Man TT became part of the FIM Motor-cycle Grand Prix World Championship (now MotoGP) as the British round of the World Motor-Cycling Championship during the period 1949–1976. Following safety concerns with the Snaefell Mountain Course and problems over inadequate "start-money" for competitors, there was a boycott of the Isle of Man TT races from the early 1970s by many of the leading competitors, motorcycle manufacturers and national motorcycle sporting federations. It is regarded as the most dangerous motorsport event in the world; The New York Times said in 2017 that the number of deaths had risen "to 146 since it was first run in 1907; if one includes fatal accidents occurring during the Manx Grand Prix ... the figure rises above 250". An account of the 2003 race by Sports Illustrated writer Franz Lidz called the TT "a test of nerves and speed that may be sports' most dangerous event." In 1976, the Isle of Man TT lost its world championship status; this was transferred to the United Kingdom by the FIM and run as the British Grand Prix for the 1977 season. The Isle of Man TT Races then became an integral part of the new style TT Formula 1, Formula 2 and Formula 3 World Championships between 1977 and 1990 to develop and maintain the international racing status of the Isle of Man TT races. The event was redeveloped by the Isle of Man Department of Tourism as the Isle of Man TT Festival from 1989 onwards. This included new racing events for the new Isle of Man TT Festival programme, including the Pre-TT Classic Races in 1989 followed by the Post-TT Races from 1991, both held on the Billown Circuit. In 2013, the Isle of Man Classic TT was developed by the Isle of Man Department of Economic Development and the Auto-Cycle Union for historic racing motorcycles, and along with the Manx Grand Prix, it formed part of the 'Isle of Man Festival of Motorcycling' held in late August of each year. The Classic TT brand ceased operation prior to the 2022 event, with classes for historic racing motorcycles integrated into the Manx Grand Prix. The TT is now promoted by the Isle of Man Government Department for Enterprise. There has been criticism of the event. In 2007, an incident during the Senior Race resulted in the deaths of a rider and two spectators. The resultant inquest made several recommendations and included several comments, such as: 'Senior Marshals may well have been elevated beyond the sphere of their competence'. The coroner also noted that "I am more than aware of the fact that the witnesses from the Manx Motor Cycle Club and the marshals are all volunteers. They give their time freely and without paid reward. Having said that however, if it were suggested because they were volunteers there should be some allowance in the standards expected of them, then I regret I cannot agree." The 2020 and 2021 TT races were cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Motor racing began on the Isle of Man in 1904 with the Gordon Bennett Eliminating Trial, restricted to touring automobiles. As the Motor Car Act 1903 placed a speed restriction of 20 mph (32 km/h) on automobiles in the UK, Julian Orde, Secretary of the Automobile Car Club of Britain and Ireland approached the authorities in the Isle of Man for the permission to race automobiles on the island's public roads. The Highways (Light Locomotive) Act 1904 gave permission in the Isle of Man for the 52.15-mile (83.93 km) Highroads Course for the 1904 Gordon Bennett Eliminating Trial which was won by Clifford Earl (Napier) in 7 hours 26.5 minutes for five laps (255.5 mi or 411.2 km) of the Highroads Course. The 1905 Gordon Bennett Trial was held on 30 May 1905 and was again won by Clifford Earl driving a Napier automobile in 6 hours and 6 minutes for six laps of the Highroads Course. This was followed in September 1905 with the first Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Race for racing automobiles, now known as the RAC Tourist Trophy and was won by John Napier (Arrol-Johnston) in 6 hours and 9 minutes at an average speed of 33.90 mph (54.56 km/h). For the 1905 Gordon Bennett Eliminating Trial it was decided to run an eliminating trial for motorcycles the day afterwards for a team to represent Great Britain in the International Motor-Cycle Cup Races. An accident at Ramsey Hairpin forced out one of the pre-race favourites, and the inability of the competitors to climb the steep Mountain Section of the course forced the organisers to use a 25-mile (40 km) section of the Gordon Bennett Trial course. This ran from Douglas south to Castletown and then north to Ballacraine along the primary A3 road and returning to the start at the Quarterbridge in Douglas via Crosby and Glen Vine along the current Snaefell Mountain Course in the reverse direction. The 1905 International Motor-Cycle Cup Race for five laps (125 mi or 201 km) was won by J.S. Campbell (Ariel) despite a fire during a pit stop in 4 hours, 9 minutes and 36 seconds at an average race speed of 30.04 mph (48.34 km/h). The TT Races since the first race in 1907 have been in the format of time-trial. The races held on the Clypse Course during the period 1954–1959 were the more traditional full grid starts along with the 1924 Lightweight TT Race and Clubmen TT Races from 1948, which were also "mass-start" races. The current format is a "clutch start" and race competitors will be "started singly at 10-second intervals". Start Preliminaries First Signal – 45 minutes before the start with a warm-up of engines in the Race Paddock and assembly area. Second Signal – 30 minutes before start. Third Signal – 15 minutes before start, race competitors move to the start-line and form-up in qualification order. Fourth Signal – 5 minutes before start, signal to clear the grid and race competitors move towards the exit-gate. Entrants must be in possession of a valid National Entrants or FIM Sponsors Licence for Road Racing. Entrants must also cite pre-filled documentation of completion of a UK driving licence or motorcycle certification, or a driver's licence from a comparable country that is recognised by UK comparable department of transportation standards and may withhold due to any pre race or post race suspensions.

Other machines admitted at the discretion of the Organisers The 1911 Isle of Man TT was the first time the Junior TT race took place, open to 300 cc single-cylinder and 340 cc twin cylinder motorcycles, contested over five laps of the new 37.5-mile (60.4 km) Snaefell Mountain Course. The first event on the new course was the Junior TT Race contested by 35 entrants, won by Percy J. Evans riding a Humber motor-cycle at an average race speed of 41.45 mph (66.71 km/h). The 1912 event was the first to limit the Junior TT to only 350 cc machines and this engine capacity prevailed until 1976, after which the category was dropped. The event was instead run for 250 cc machines until 1994 when replaced by the 600 cc Supersport class. 1911 For single cylinder motorcycles not exceeding 300 cc engine capacity and 340 cc twin cylinder motorcycles. 1912–1948 For motorcycles not exceeding 350 cc engine capacity. 1949–1953 FIM World Championship event for motorcycles not exceeding 350 cc engine capacity and held on the Snaefell mountain course. 1954–1959 FIM World Championship event for motorcycles not exceeding 350 cc engine capacity and held on the Clypse Course. 1960–1976 FIM World Championship event for motorcycles not exceeding 350 cc engine capacity and held on the Mountain Course. 1977–1994 for motorcycles not exceeding 250 cc engine capacity and held on the Mountain Course. 1995 onwards for motorcycles not exceeding 600 cc engine capacity and held on the Mountain Course. The 2015 specifications for entries into the Supersport TT race are: TT Supersport: (Machines complying with the 2015 FIM Supersport Championship specifications) Over 400 cc up to 600 cc 4 cylinders 4-stroke Over 600 cc up to 675 cc 3 cylinders 4-stroke Over 600 cc up to 750 cc 2 cylinders 4-stroke Minimum Weight 161 kg The 2015 specifications for entries for the Superstock TT, an event for production based motorcycles racing with treaded road tyres, are based on the FIM Superstock Championship specifications, as follows: Superstock TT: (Machines complying with the 2012 FIM Superstock Championship specifications) Over 750 cc up to 1000 cc 4 cylinders 4-stroke Over 750 cc up to 1000 cc 3 cylinders 4-stroke Over 850 cc up to 1200 cc 2 cylinders 4-stroke Minimum (Dry) Weight 170 kg Supertwin TT 2022 saw the introduction of the supertwin race ran over 3 laps on Wednesday the 8th of June, increased to 4 laps the following year. The class is very similar to the lightweight class which last ran in 2019, although with some differences. The maximum capacity has been increased to 700cc allowing the Yamaha YZF-R7 and Aprilia RS660 to compete. In 2022 bikes with capacities of 651cc+ were required to run 10 kg heavier than the 150 kg limit for the 650cc machines, but 2023 saw this changed and all bikes in the class now have a minimum weight of 150 kg. The 1923 TT was the first time the Sidecar TT race was run, over three laps (113 mi or 182 km) of the Mountain Course and was won by Freddie Dixon and passenger Walter Denny with a Douglas and special banking-sidecar at an average race speed of 53.15 mph (85.54 km/h). For the 1926 event the Sidecar and Ultra-Lightweight TT classes were dropped due to lack of entries. The Sidecar race was re-introduced from the 1954 event for Sidecars not exceeding 500 cc engine capacity, run on the Clypse Course. A non-championship 750 cc class for sidecars was introduced at the 1968 event. For the 1976 event the race was held over two-legs. From 1975, the previous 500 cc and 750 cc classes for Sidecars were replaced by a 1000 cc engine capacity class. The new FIM Formula 2 class for Sidecars was introduced for the 1990 Isle of Man TT. 1954–1959 FIM World Championship Event for Side-Cars not exceeding 500 cc engine capacity. Race held on the Clypse Course. 1960–1976 FIM World Championship Event held on Mountain Course. 1968–1974 Non-Championship event for Sidecars not exceeding 750 cc. 1975–1989 Sidecars not exceeding 1000 cc engine capacity. 1990– FIM Formula 2 Sidecar race for two-stroke engines not exceeding 350 cc or four-stroke engines not exceeding 600 cc. The 2015 specifications for entries into the Sidecar TT race are: Machines must comply with general technical rules as per ACU Standing Regulations and 2015 Isle of Man TT regulations. Engine Types 501 – 600 cc, 4 stroke, 4 cylinder, Production based motorcycle engines. For the 1911 Isle of Man TT, the first TT event using the Snaefell Mountain Course or Mountain Course, two separate races were introduced. The first event was a four lap Junior TT race and a separate Senior TT race for 500 cc single-cylinder and 585 cc twin-cylinder motorcycles, over five laps of the new 37.5-mile (60.4 km) Snaefell Mountain Course. The new technical challenges of the Mountain Course forced changes on entrants and motorcycle manufacturers alike. The American Indian motorcycle factory fitted a two-speed gearbox and chain-drive. This proved to be the winning combination when Oliver Godfrey won the 1911 Senior TT race riding an Indian at an average speed of 47.63 mph (76.65 km/h). Fitted with a six-speed belt drive Charlie Collier riding a Matchless motorcycle finished second in the 1911 Senior TT race and was later disqualified for illegal refuelling. During an early morning practice session for the 1911 Isle of Man TT races, Victor Surridge died after crashing his Rudge motorcycle at Glen Helen, the first death of a competitor on the Snaefell Mountain Course and the first death in the Isle of Man of a person in an automotive accident. 1911 For single cylinder motorcycles not exceeding 500 cc engine capacity and 585 cc twin cylinder motorcycles. 1912–1939 For motorcycles not exceeding 500 cc engine capacity. 1947–1948 For motorcycles not exceeding 500 cc engine capacity and a ban on engine supercharging. 1949–1976 FIM World Championship event for motorcycles not exceeding 500 cc engine capacity. 1977–1984 for motorcycles not exceeding 500 cc engine capacity. 1985–2004 for motorcycles complying with ACU TT Formula 1 rules not exceeding 1,010 cc engine capacity. 2004 onwards for motorcycles complying with ACU/FIM Superbike rules not exceeding 1,000 cc engine capacity. The 2015 specifications for entries into the Senior TT race are: TT Superbike: (Machines complying with the 2015 FIM Superbike Championship specifications) Over 750 cc up to 1000 cc 4 cylinders 4-stroke Over 750 cc up to 1000 cc 3 cylinders 4-stroke Over 850 cc up to 1200 cc 2 cylinders 4-stroke Supersport Junior TT (without limitation of tyre choice) TT Superstock (without limitation of tyre choice) Other machines admitted at the discretion of the Organisers. The Clubman races with Lightweight, Junior and Senior classes were held for production motorcycles from 1947 until 1956. A Senior 1000 cc class provided an opportunity for Vincent motorcycles. The riders were little-known, but as the stars were barred from entering the class, it provided a stepping-stone for future-stars but resulted in less spectator-interest. The series became dominated by one model – the BSA Gold Star, and with little competition from other manufacturers, was discontinued. When previewing the impending re-introduction of a specification-controlled, roadster-based class in March 1967, David Dixon wrote: "lack of inter-make rivalry probably put the final nail in the coffin". Writing in UK monthly magazine Motor Cyclist Illustrated, racing journalist Ray Knight, who had achieved a lap speed of nearly 88 mph on a Triumph Tiger 100 roadster-based racing motorcycle in the Manx Grand Prix, commented in early 1965 that the ACU had refused a request from manufacturers to run a production TT race, which he thought was a missed opportunity, particularly considering the dwindling support for the 500 cc race. A Production TT for roadster-based motorcycles having classes for maximum engine capacities of 250 cc, 500 cc and 750 cc was introduced from 1967 until 1976 when the class was discontinued. The Production TT was reintroduced for the 1984 races in three classes, reduced to two classes on safety grounds for the 1990 races. For the 2005 races the Superstock class replaced the previous 1000 cc and 600 cc Production TT classes that had been part of the race schedule since 1989. The TT Zero was a one lap race for electric bikes running from 2010 to 2019. It was announced that the race would take a two-year break after 2019, but it never came back on the schedule since. After the completion of a practice or race period, an official course vehicle displaying the notice Roads Open proceeds around the Mountain Course, passing each point opening the roads including side-access junctions to public use. On the Snaefell mountain road section from Ramsey to Douglas, the official vehicle displays the notice Roads Open One Way. Originally introduced in 1935, there are eight machines positioned around the course to provide a rapid response to any incidents. Selected riders have previous race experience and are first-aid trained, with machines carrying medical equipment that can assist in managing a casualty. They also have other duties such as course inspection, observation of machines on the course for visible faults, and review and report any course incidents. As of 2023, all travelling marshals rode Honda CBR1000RR Fireblades. The 1982 Road Racing Act (Isle of Man) and the supplementary TT Road Races Orders allow vehicles and pedestrians to cross the Snaefell Mountain Course at certain points between scheduled race periods under the supervision of a police officer. Several permanent pedestrian overbridges have been erected. These points include: A2 St Ninian's Crossroads with the A22 Ballaquayle Road and the A22 Ballanard Road A2 junction at Bray Hill with the Tromode Road and Stoney Road A1 Peel Road between Braddan Bridge (Jubilee Oak) and the Quarterbridge A2 Governor's Road, Onchan, the A2 Glencrutchery Road and Victoria Road at Governor's Bridge A2 Glencrutchery Road between Second & Third Avenues and Victoria Road A18 Bemahague Road at Bedstead Corner, Onchan Pedestrian overbridge at Glencrutchery Road, Douglas, close to start/finish and TT Grandstand Pedestrian overbridge at Bedstead Corner, Douglas, with Hailwood Avenue junction to right A1 Douglas to Peel road with the A23 Eyreton Road and the B36 Old Church Road, Crosby A3 Castletown to Ramsey road junction with B10 Sartfield Road and the Ballaleigh Road at Barregarrow Crossroads, Michael A3 junction with A10 Station Road and C37 Ballaugh Glen Road at Ballaugh Bridge A3 junction with A14 Sandygate Road and A14 Tholt-y-Will Glen Road at Sulby Crossroads A2 Albert Square and Princes Road, Ramsey at the junction with A18 Snaefell Mountain Road, close to May Hill Pedestrian overbridge before School House Corner, western approach to Ramsey town Pedestrian overbridge exiting Ramsey town centre, looking south-east towards May Hill Pedestrian overbridge at The Bungalow, on Snaefell mountain The TT Access Road runs parallel to a section of the A1 Peel Road, which is part of the Snaefell Mountain Course, and operates during practice and race periods to enable vehicles to pass from inside of the race course to the outside. It runs along a section of former railway line on the historic Douglas to Peel route, from the junction of the A5 New Castletown Road at the Quarter Bridge, passing under the course at Braddan Bridge, to an exit at Braddan School Road in Douglas outskirts, near the former Braddan Railway Halt and the A23/Ballafletcher Road junction. The access road is a narrow, single-track width with passing places and is restricted to cars and light vans below a weight limit of 3,500 kilograms (3.4 long tons; 3.9 short tons). When used for vehicular traffic, pedestrian access is prohibited, but at other times it is part of a system of nature trails. Between 1907 and 2023, there have been 156 fatalities during official practices or races on the Snaefell Mountain Course, and 269 total fatalities (this number includes the riders killed during the Manx Grand Prix, and Clubman TT race series of the late 1940s/1950s). In 2016, 5 riders died on the course during official practices or races. There were six fatalities among competitors in the 1970 and 2022 Isle of Man TTs, making them the two deadliest years in the history of the event. On 30 May 2018, an experienced TT rider, Steve Mercer, was seriously injured during a head-on collision with an official Course Car at Ballacrye. The car, being driven at high speed, was conveying police officers to officiate at the scene of a fatality involving Dan Kneen. Mercer was unconscious for five days and hospitalised for five months due to multiple injuries. He was one of seven riders who had been halted on the course and turned back by marshals, being instructed to proceed back to the TT Grandstand area in the reverse direction after the red flag stoppage. Immediately after the accident the organisers changed their protocols, requiring that returning riders must be controlled by motorcycle-mounted travelling marshals to the front and rear. An independent inquiry into the circumstances was arranged by ACU Events, the event organisers. The Auto-Cycle Union, the Isle of Man Department for Enterprise, and the inquiry report author, lawyer Rob Jones, a former chief executive of the Motor Sports Association, all refused to release the report as it was confidential and privately owned by the ACU. The ACU admitted liability for the accident, but instructed that any legal claim for compensation by Mercer must be filed in the Isle of Man. The ACU stated that Mercer was receiving financial assistance through its "extensive insurance arrangements". In 2019, it was reported that the driver of the car in the collision had quit after criticism that he exceeded a newly introduced speed limit recorded by a GPS tracking device when he drove to attend a fatality involving Chris Swallow at Ballaugh in August's Senior Classic TT. Gary Thompson, Clerk of the Course and an ACU employee, had been criticised in 2018 for also fulfilling the role of Safety Officer; consequently a new incumbent was in place for 2019. From 1915 to 1919, and 1940 to 1946, no TT events took place, due to the outbreak of World Wars I and II. Events continued from 1920 to 1939 and 1947 to 2000. Since TT 1947, the Isle of Man TT has only been cancelled three times: 2001, 2020 and 2021, all of which were due to viral outbreaks. The 2001 Isle of Man TT races were cancelled because of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in the spring and summer of 2001. Disinfecting 40,000 spectators and competitors (and their motorcycles) to ensure the disease was kept off the island proved difficult. In March 2020, the Isle of Man Government announced the cancellation of the 2020 TT due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Classic TT was subsequently cancelled in May, and in December 2020, it was announced that 2021's TT races would also not go ahead, due to the continued worldwide spread of the virus. In 2020, the Isle of Man Government lost an estimated £4.8 million of its annual projected revenue due to the cancellation of the TT races. The event returned in 2022 after a two-year absence. Updated in October 2023 Erroneously listed as having 12 wins on the official TT database Erroneously listed as having 4 wins on the official TT database The Isle of Man TT was part of the FIM Motorcycle Grand Prix World Championship (now MotoGP) between 1949 and 1976. During this period the Isle of Man TT Races counted as the United Kingdom round including the Sidecar TT, 50 cc Ultra-Lightweight TT, 125 cc Lightweight TT, 250 cc Lightweight TT, 350 cc Junior TT and 500 cc Senior TT races counted towards the FIM Motor-Cycle Grand Prix World Championship. After the 1972 races, multiple world champion, 10-time TT race winner and dominant motorcycle racer of his time Giacomo Agostini announced he would never race again at the Isle of Man, declaring it too dangerous for international competition and that it was outrageous that such a race should ever be part of a scenario professional riders were forced into; at this point the Isle of Man TT was not suited to the growing professionalism and business aspects of Grand Prix motorcycle racing. More and more riders joined his boycott, and after 1976 the race was struck from the championship and replaced by the British Grand Prix. Most Meritorious Female Competitor – The Susan Jenness Trophy is awarded yearly by the Executive Committee of the TT Supporters' Club, in recognition of the "most meritorious performance by a female competitor" during the previous TT meeting. The award has not been awarded since 2019. There have been numerous video games based on the Isle of Man TT; the first was the 1995 Sega arcade game Manx TT Super Bike, which was later ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997. Several other games have followed since, including Suzuki TT Superbikes (2005), TT Superbikes: Real Road Racing Championship and TT Superbikes Legends (both 2008), all of which were released exclusively for the PlayStation 2, and developed by Jester Interactive. Bigben Interactive has since revived the TT game license, releasing TT Isle Of Man: Ride on the Edge in 2018 and two sequels in 2020 and 2023. The Ramsey Sprint has been run since 1978 and is one of the biggest events during the TT race festival. The Sprint is run along the 1 km long Mooragh Promenade. The music festival Sprintfest is also held in the same town, Ramsey, on the weekend between practice week and race week.
