In the 1990s, a new stage began in the development of Belarusian radio broadcasting: reforming the structure of the Belarusian radio, improving its program, ideological and creative components. In August 1994, by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus, on the basis of the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting, the National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus was established. In May of the same year, the radio broadcasting programs "Krinitsa" and "Belorusskaya Molodezhnaya" were combined into the program "Radio 2" (since 2002, "Kultura"), which began to be retransmitted on the second wire broadcasting channel.

In the 2000s, a number of TV channels were created in the Belteleradiocompany system: LAD (2003), Belarus-TV (2005). The introduction of test digital transmitters in 2004 made it possible to record broadcasts more efficiently and with high quality. Since 2005, all channels and radio stations of the Belarusian Radio were now being streamed live on the Internet. From December 22, 2005, to December 28, 2010, Alexander Zimovsky was the chairman of the Belteleradiocompany. From October 1, 2009, to December 31, 2012 (according to Presidential Decree No. 523, signed on October 23, 2009), the NGTRK and the organizations included in its system are exempt from paying taxes on profit and value added (except for value added tax levied upon import of goods into the customs territory of Belarus, unless otherwise provided by legislative acts). In November 2011, the channels were rebranded: on November 5, Channel One changed its name to "Belarus 1", on November 14 LAD became known as "Belarus 2", and the international "Belarus TV" on January 1, 2013, was renamed "Belarus 24".

On May 28, 2021, according to the results of post-election monitoring, the European Broadcasting Union suspended the membership of the BTRK in the Broadcasting Union. The indignation of the union was caused, among other things, by the broadcast on the air of "Belarus 1" of the "repentance" of political prisoners (in particular, Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapieha), made under obvious pressure.
