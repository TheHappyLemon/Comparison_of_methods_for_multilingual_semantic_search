Shahr-e Kord (Persian: شهركرد, also Romanized as Shahrekord and Shahr Kord) is a city in the Central District of Shahrekord County, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, Iran, and serves as the capital of the province, county, and district. It is the largest city in the province, and is 90 km away from Iran's third largest city, Isfahan. Shahr-e Kord is populated by Persians, Lurs and Turkic people. At the 2006 census, its population was 126,746 in 31,977 households. The following census in 2011 counted 159,775 people in 44,081 households. The latest census in 2016 showed the population had risen to 190,441 people in 55,492 households. Shahr-e Kord, at face value, seems to mean "City of the Kurds". In antiquity, the place had been called "Dezh Gord" (دژگرد), where dezh (دژ) means "fortress" and gord (گرد) means "hero".[citation needed] After the Muslim conquest of Persia, the name changed to "Deh Kord" (Persian: دهكرد); dezh was reinterpreted as deh (ده) meaning "village" and gord became kord because the Arabic alphabet lacks the letters "g" (گ), and "zh" (ژ). Other examples of cities whose names changed partly due to the influence of the Arabic language are Chamgordan, Boroujerd and Dezful, which were called Chamgord, Borougord and Dezhpol, respectively, before the Islamic conquest. In 1935, the name was finally changed to its present form with deh being replaced with shahr (شهر) meaning "city", which better reflects the size of Shahr-e Kord.[citation needed] On the other side, Lurs have been known as Kurds in the post Islamic conquest literature. Michael M. Gunter states that Lurs are closely related to the Kurds but that they "apparently began to be distinguished from the Kurds 1,000 years ago." Coins have been found in Shahr-e Kord dating back to the Sassanian and Parthian era. Notable people from Shahr-e Kord include painter Arghavan Khosravi.
