After this, he was awarded for the League Football Education's 'The 11'.

Nevertheless, he went on to make nine appearances for the team in the 2015–16 season.[citation needed] Ahead of the 2016–17 season, there were hints of Calvert-Lewin making a first team breakthrough, with his former manager Wilder appointed as the new Sheffield United manager. He only made one appearance in the 2016–17 season, which was against Crewe Alexandra, in a 2–1 loss in the EFL Cup campaign. Calvert-Lewin signed for Everton in a £1.5 million deal on 31 August 2016.
