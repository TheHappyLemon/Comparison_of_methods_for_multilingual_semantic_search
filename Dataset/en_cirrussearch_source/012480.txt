Nickel–Strunz classification is a scheme for categorizing minerals based upon their chemical composition, introduced by German mineralogist Karl Hugo Strunz (24 February 1910 – 19 April 2006) in his Mineralogische Tabellen (1941). The 4th and the 5th edition was also edited by Christel Tennyson (1966). It was followed by A.S. Povarennykh with a modified classification (1966 in Russian, 1972 in English). As curator of the Mineralogical Museum of Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität (now known as the Humboldt University of Berlin), Strunz had been tasked with sorting the museum's geological collection according to crystal-chemical properties. His book Mineralogical Tables, has been through a number of modifications; the most recent edition, published in 2001, is the ninth (Mineralogical Tables by Hugo Strunz and Ernest H. Nickel (31 August 1925 – 18 July 2009)). James A. Ferraiolo was responsible for it at Mindat.org. The IMA/CNMNC supports the Nickel–Strunz database. The Nickel–Strunz code scheme is NN.XY.##x, where: NN: Nickel–Strunz mineral class number X: Nickel–Strunz mineral division letter Y: Nickel–Strunz mineral family letter ##x: Nickel–Strunz mineral/group number; x an add-on letter The current scheme divides minerals into ten classes, which are further divided into divisions, families and groups according to chemical composition and crystal structure. elements sulfides and sulfosalts halides oxides, hydroxides and arsenites carbonates and nitrates borates sulfates, chromates, molybdates and tungstates phosphates, arsenates and vanadates silicates organic compounds IMA/CNMNC proposes a new hierarchical scheme (Mills et al. 2009), using the Nickel–Strunz classes (10 ed) this gives: Classification of minerals (non silicates) Nickel–Strunz class 01: Native Elements Class: native elements Nickel–Strunz class 02: Sulfides and Sulfosalts Class 02.A – 02.G: sulfides, selenides, tellurides (including arsenides, antimonides, bismuthinides) Class 02.H – 02.M: sulfosalts (including sulfarsenites, sulfantimonites, sulfobismuthites, etc.) Nickel–Strunz class 03: Halogenides Class: halides Nickel–Strunz class 04: Oxides Class: oxides Class: hydroxides Class: arsenites (including antimonites, bismuthites, sulfites, selenites and tellurites) Nickel–Strunz class 05: Carbonates and Nitrates Class: carbonates Class: nitrates Nickel–Strunz class 06: Borates Class: borates Subclass: nesoborates Subclass: soroborates Subclass: cycloborates Subclass: inoborates Subclass: phylloborates Subclass: tectoborates Nickel–Strunz class 07: Sulfates, Selenates, Tellurates Class: sulfates, selenates, tellurates Class: chromates Class: molybdate, wolframates and niobates Nickel–Strunz class 08: Phosphates, Arsenates, Vanadates Class: phosphates Class: arsenates and vanadates Nickel–Strunz class 10: Organic Compounds Class: organic compounds Classification of minerals (silicates) Nickel–Strunz class 09: Silicates and Germanates Class: silicates Subclass: nesosilicates Subclass: sorosilicates Subclass: cyclosilicates Subclass: inosilicates Subclass: phyllosilicates Subclass: tectosilicates without zeolitic H2O Subclass: tectosilicates with zeolitic H2O; zeolite family Subclass: unclassified silicates Subclass: germanates Classification of non-silicate minerals Classification of silicate minerals Hey's Mineral Index Timeline of the discovery and classification of minerals Dana Classification System Knobloch, Eberhard (2003).
