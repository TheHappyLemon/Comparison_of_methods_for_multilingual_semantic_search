Smulders was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to a Dutch father and a British mother.

She was named after her great-aunt, from whom she gained the nickname "Cobie". Smulders describes herself as "a fluent listener" of French. She has four sisters. Smulders was also a member of the Girl Guides of Canada as a child, participating as a Brownie (Girl Guide program for 7- to 10-year-olds). In her youth, Smulders aspired to be a marine biologist. She took an interest in theatre throughout high school and briefly studied at the University of Victoria before returning to acting. Smulders worked in modeling, which she later said she "kind of hated", adding that the experience made her hesitant about pursuing acting as a career: "You know, you go into these rooms, and I've had the experience of people judging you physically for so long and I was over that but, then it was like... 'Oh no, I have to actually perform. I have to do well, and I have to have a voice... and I have to have thoughts now.'" Smulders made her professional acting debut in 2002, with guest appearances in the UPN science fiction comedy series Special Unit 2 and the Showtime science fiction drama series Jeremiah. She subsequently made multiple appearances on television, including in the Fox supernatural drama series Tru Calling (2003), the WB superhero series Smallville (2003), and the Global space opera series Andromeda (2005).

In 2017 she made her Broadway debut portraying Joanna Lyppiatt in the revival of Noël Coward's comedy Present Laughter opposite Kevin Kline. Marilyn Stasio of Variety praised Smulders in the role writing, "Smulders has a graceful, Cowardian air in the role, and makes Susan Hilferty’s costumes look even more fabulous."

For her performance she was honored with a Theatre World Award for Outstanding Broadway debut. Her performance was filmed with Great Performances and shown on PBS.
