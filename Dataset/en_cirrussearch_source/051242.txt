Кирова, romanized: Voyenno-meditsinskaya akademiya imeni S. M. Kirova) is a higher education institution of military medicine in Saint Petersburg and the Russian Federation. Senior medical staff are trained for the Armed Forces and conduct research in military medical services. The origins of the academy go back to the years of Peter the Great. In 1715, by the Tsar's order the Admiralty Hospital in the Vyborg Side of Saint Petersburg was founded. In 1717 next to in the Land Military Hospital was opened. Since 1773 surgical schools attached to both hospitals were operating. In 1786, those schools were consolidated into the Main Medical College. It became the principal training center for army and fleet physicians. Unofficially, the year 1714 is considered the foundation year of the academy. The Medical and Surgical Academy was established by the order of Emperor Paul I of 18/29 December 1798 on the initiative of Baron Alexei Vasilyev (ru), General Director of the Medical College. It was decorated with a set of panel paintings by Giuseppe Bernasconi. It was known as the Imperial Medical and Surgical Academy from 1808. According to the order of Emperor Alexander I, a member of the Medical and Surgical Academy had the rights, liabilities, and benefits of a member of the Academy of Sciences. Sir James Wylie, a Scottish baronet, managed the academy between 1808 and 1838. His contributions have been commemorated with a monument which stood in front of the academy until the October Revolution. It was later relocated and replaced with a statue of Hygieia. In 1881, the academy's official name was changed into the Imperial Military Medical Academy. Ivan Romanovich Tarkhanov conducted some experiments there. In 1890–1901, the academy's president was Viktor Pashutin, one of the founders of the pathophysiologic school in Russia and of pathophysiology as an independent scientific discipline. The Nobel-prize winning physiologist Ivan Pavlov graduated from the academy in 1879. Since 1895 he headed Department of Physiology at the academy for three decades. In 1904–1924, Nikolai Kravkov, the founder of Russian national school of pharmacologists, headed the academy's Department of Pharmacology. In 1903–1936, one of the academy's professors was Sergey Fedorov. The academy was also among the pioneers of medical education for women, launching the courses for nurse-midwives in 1872. Nadezhda Suslova, the first female physician in Russia, attended Sechenov's classes at the academy. After Sergey Kirov's assassination in 1934, the academy received his name. Leon Orbeli, one of Pavlov's disciples, led the academy in 1943–1950. In 1956, S. M. Kirov Military Medical Academy was united with the Naval Medical Academy established on the basis of Obukhovskaya Hospital and the Third Leningrad Medical Institute in 1940. The academy had six faculties, 61 departments, 30 clinics, 16 research laboratories, and two research centres in 2002. Late in 2011, minister of defense Anatoliy Serdyukov declared his intention to move the academy from the centre of Saint Petersburg to one of its suburbs. This decision was overturned after Serdyukov had been sacked. Graduates are commissioned as officers with medical doctor credentials.
