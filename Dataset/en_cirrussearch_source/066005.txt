Camilo Andrés Mena Márquez (born 1 October 2002) is a Colombian professional footballer who plays as a right winger for Polish club Lechia Gdańsk. Mena was born in Concordia, Antioquia, but was left displaced due to violence in Urabá Antioquia. Mena started his career with Alianza Platanera [es]. After six months with Alianza Platanera, he moved to Bogotá in 2017, joining the academy of Tigres. He made his debut the following year, at the age of fifteen, and made his first start in a 2–1 home loss to Cortuluá. In October 2019, after good performances for Tigres, he was named by English newspaper The Guardian as one of the best footballers born in 2002 worldwide. In December 2019, it was announced that Mena would join Categoría Primera A side Deportivo Pereira for the 2020 season. After a year with Deportivo Pereira, he moved to Latvia to sign for Valmiera. During his time with Valmiera, he was named as the most influential under-20 player in world football, as he had more goals and assists than any other player under the age of twenty. He also led the scoring charts for all players under the age of twenty worldwide, joint with Malaysian player Arif Aiman Hanapi. In February 2023, he joined Polish side Jagiellonia on a six-month loan deal. In August 2023, despite Mena's wishes to join the defending Ekstraklasa champions Raków Częstochowa, Valmiera agreed on a deal to sell him to second division side Lechia Gdańsk. On 4 August, Mena signed a four-year contract with the Pomeranian club. Mena represented Colombia at the 2017 South American U-15 Championship, scoring once in a 12–0 win over the Czech Republic. He has also represented Colombia at under-17 level. As of 2 September 2023.
