Aizliegtais paņēmiens (lat. The Forbidden Method) is a Latvian investigative news program produced by Latvijas Televīzija (LTV). Its creator and host is journalist Guntis Bojārs. Every program is divided into two segments: Operation and Discussion. During the Operation segment LTV journalists use both public information and hidden camera to research a popular subject in Latvia. During the Discussion segment host Guntis Bojārs interviews usually 3 experts or politicians on their observations while watching the Operation. Each episode begins with a brief description of the program. Riga landscape and passersby are shown, but these frames are accelerated. Background music is played. Almost all the series (except for specials) begin with the following introductory phrase read by Aigars Rozenbergs: We'll probably be condemned, but, forgive us, sometimes it's the only way to find out the reality of events, the law and the true face of society. How is it really? "Forbidden method". In 2017 the five episode special Operācija: "Tokija" (lit. Operation: Tokyo) gained Employers’ Confederation of Latvia prize. In this special a journalist from Latvijas Televīzija worked in restaurant chain Tokyo City and documented using a hidden camera a sustained tax evasion scheme.
