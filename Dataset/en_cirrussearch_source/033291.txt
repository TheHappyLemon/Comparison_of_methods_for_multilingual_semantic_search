Lothar Maximilian Lorenz Schmid (10 May 1928 – 18 May 2013) was a German chess grandmaster. He was born in Radebeul in Saxony into a family who were the co-owners of the Karl May Press, which published the German Karl May adventure novels. He was best known as the chief arbiter at several World Chess Championship matches, in particular the 1972 encounter between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky at Reykjavík. He was also an avid collector of chess books and paraphernalia. It was reputed that he owned the largest known private chess library in the world, as well as a renowned collection of chess art, chessboards and chess pieces from around the globe. In 1941, at the age of 13, Schmid won the Dresden chess championship which marked the beginning of his chess career. In 1943, he took second place in Vienna (German Juniors Championship).

In 1968 in his home town of Bamberg, he tied for second place with Tigran Petrosian who was the world champion at the time, behind Paul Keres, an outcome described by the Oxford Companion to Chess as "Schmid's greatest playing achievement". In 1970, he won the Mar del Plata. In 1971, he finished equal second with two others in Adelaide. In 1979, he tied for third place in Lugano. In 1980, he won the fifth edition of the BBC's The Master Game series, ahead of Viktor Korchnoi and Vlastimil Hort. Lothar Schmid played for West Germany at eleven Chess Olympiads.

In correspondence chess, he won the first German Championship (1950–1952), the first Eduard Dyckhoff Memorial (1954–1956), and came second with Lucius Endzelins, behind Viacheslav Ragozin, in the second World Correspondence Championship (1956–1959). Schmid was awarded the International Master title in 1951, and the Grandmaster title in 1959. Schmid was awarded the International Arbiter title in 1975. He was the chief arbiter for the Fischer–Spassky 1972, Karpov–Korchnoi 1978, Kasparov–Karpov 1986 World Championship matches, and for the Fischer–Spassky 1992 'Revenge Match'. All of the matches involved cut-throat battles both on and off the board and required a lot of professionalism to handle. Managing those made Schmid recognized as the world's leading chess arbiter. Schmid was featured in the 2014 Bobby Fischer biopic Pawn Sacrifice, which depicted the 1972 contest between Fischer and Spassky, played by the actor Brett Watson. Among the many rare books he owned was one of only ten copies that have survived of the first-ever printed chess manual Repetición d'Amores y Arte de Ajedrez, published in Salamanca in 1497.
