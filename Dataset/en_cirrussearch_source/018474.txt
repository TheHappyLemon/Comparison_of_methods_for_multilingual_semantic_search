Jahangir Khan (Pashto, Urdu: جهانګير خان born 10 December 1963) is a former professional Pakistani squash player. He won the World Open title six times, and the British Open title ten times (1982–1991). Jahangir Khan is widely regarded as the greatest squash player of all time, and one of the greatest sportsmen in Pakistan history. From 1981 to 1986, Khan was unbeaten and during that time won 555 consecutive matches – the longest winning streak by any athlete in top-level professional sport as recorded by Guinness World Records. He retired as a player in 1993, and served as President of the World Squash Federation from 2002 to 2008. Later in 2008, he became Emeritus President of the World Squash Federation. Khan was born on 10 December 1963 into a Pashtun family in Karachi. His family originally hailed from Nawan Kalli, a small village near Peshawar in Pakistan. A member of the Khan family, he was born into a family of squash players; his father Roshan Khan won the British Open title in 1957, and his older brother was Torsam Khan. His two nieces Natasha Khan (better known as Bat for Lashes) is a British singer, and Maria Khan is a professional footballer who has played for the Pakistan women national football team. Jahangir Khan was coached initially by his father Roshan, the 1957 British Open champion, then by his brother Torsam. After his brother's sudden death he was coached by his cousin Rehmat, who guided Khan through most of his career. In 1979, the Pakistan selectors decided not to select Khan to play in the world championships in Australia but he entered the World Amateur Individual Championship, at the age of 15, and became the youngest-ever winner of that event. In November 1979, Torsam Khan, who had been one of the leading international squash players in the 1970s, died suddenly of a heart attack during Australian Open match in Adelaide Australia. Torsam's death profoundly affected Khan. He considered quitting the game, but decided to pursue a career in the sport as a tribute to his brother. He retired as a player in 1993, and has served as President of the World Squash Federation from 2002 to 2008, later became Emeritus President. 1981 – At age 17 became the youngest winner of the World Open, beating Australia's Geoff Hunt in final. 1984 – Featured on a Government of Pakistan issued postage stamp. 1999 – Sport and Youth Award by French Government 2005 – Times Award – Time Magazine named Khan as one of Asia's Heroes in the last 60 years. 2007 – Awarded an honorary degree of Doctorate of Philosophy by London Metropolitan University. 2017 – Featured on a Government of Japan issued commemorative stamp 2018 – Winner of the 8th Asian Award for Outstanding Achievement in Sport 2023 – Nishan-i-Imtiaz by the President of Pakistan.
