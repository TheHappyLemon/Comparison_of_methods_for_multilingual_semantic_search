Armenia has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 15 times since making its debut in 2006, when Andr√© became the first participant representing Armenia and was the first singer from the Caucasus region to compete at Eurovision. Armenia has reached the top 10 on seven occasions, with the country's best result in the contest being two fourth-place finishes, achieved by Sirusho with the song "Q√©l√©, Q√©l√©" (2008), and Aram Mp3 with "Not Alone" (2014). 2011 was the first year that Armenia failed to advance from the semi-final round. This was followed by the country withdrawing from the 2012 contest due to security concerns in the host city, Baku. In 2018 and 2019, Armenia consecutively failed to qualify from the semi-finals for the second and third time respectively. In July 2003, private broadcaster Armenia TV claimed to be debuting at the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, despite not being a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event. The EBU later denied this claim. After AMPTV was promoted to active member in July 2005, Armenia debuted at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2006 with the song "Without Your Love" performed by one of Armenia's top artists, Andr√©, and produced by Anush Hovnanyan. At the time, only the top 10 countries from the previous edition and the "Big Four" were automatically qualified for the final, Armenia had to compete in the semi-final to qualify. Andr√©, who was first to perform in the semi-final, reached the final of the contest on 20 May 2006 and gave Armenia a successful debut coming in eighth position. Having reached the top ten, Armenia did not have to compete in the semi-final in the 2007 contest, where the country achieved another 8th position. In 2008, Armenia reached the top five for the first time, with Sirusho finishing fourth with the song "Q√©l√©, Q√©l√©", which received the most 12 points in the final, with a total of eight. This result was followed by two more top ten placements in 2009 and 2010, making Armenia, at the time, one of only three countries that had always placed in the top ten since the introduction of the semi-finals. This streak was broken in the 2011 contest, when Emmy and the song "Boom Boom" failed to qualify from the first semi-final by a margin of one point. On 7 March 2012, Armenia announced that it would withdraw from the 2012 contest, because of security concerns in the host city Baku. Despite their 2012 withdrawal, Armenia confirmed participation in the 2013 contest in Sweden. In 2014, Armenia matched their highest placement from 2008, with Aram Mp3 and the song "Not Alone" reaching fourth place. Armenia has reached the final in 12 out of 15 contests, failing to advance to the final for the second time in 2018, finishing 15th in the first semi-final. In 2019, they failed to qualify for a third time, placing 16th in the second semi-final. Armenia had originally planned to participate in the 2021 contest, but later withdrew due to social and political crises in the aftermath of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. Armenia returned to the contest in 2022, with Rosa Linn and the song "Snap", qualifying for the first time since 2017. In 2023, Armenia sent Brunette with song Future Lover. At the contest, Brunette placed 6th in semi final 2 with 99 points, therefore qualifying to final where she placed 14th with 122 points, which is Armenia's best result since 2016. AMPTV also has a program called Eurovision Diary, which details the experiences of Armenian Eurovision entrants. The program begins every year when the artist is chosen and ends with the Eurovision final.

For example, if Germany and France placed inside the top ten, the 11th and 12th spots were advanced to next year's Grand Final along with all countries ranked in the top ten. The 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rau, Oliver (19 July 2003). "'Armenia to participate in Song Contest 2004'". ESCToday. Archived from the original on 3 November 2013.
