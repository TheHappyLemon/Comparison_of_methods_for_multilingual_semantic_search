Solvita Āboltiņa (née Mellupe; born 19 February 1963) is a Latvian politician who was Speaker of the Saeima from 2010 until 2014. She graduated from Riga Secondary School No. 5, a German language immersion school in 1981, and from the Faculty of Law at the Latvian State University in 1986. After entering politics in 2001, she has been a deputy of the Saeima since November 7, 2006. In November 2014 after a parliamentary election she was replaced as the speaker and appointed chairwoman of the National Security Committee of the Saeima. She caused controversy after being 'struck off' the Unity list of candidates by electors at the 2014 election. Such an outcome is possible for any candidate under Latvia's method of proportional representation. As a result, she was not returned as a member of the Saeima and elected Unity member Jānis Junkurs forfeited his mandate to allow the party President to continue to sit in parliament. At the emergency congress of the "Unity" party on June 4, 2016, she no longer applied for the position of chairman of the board. In November 2017, S. Āboltiņa was expelled from the party "for disregarding the party's internal discipline, deliberately undermining the authority of the party board and participating in behind-the-scenes negotiations with the aim of discrediting the process of selecting the minister of economy". At the end of the year, the mandate of the deputy was suspended. .  Estonia: Recipient First Class of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana (05.06.2012, serie 1003 - decision n° 99) "LR tieslietu ministre no 2004.gada 2.decembra" (in Latvian).
