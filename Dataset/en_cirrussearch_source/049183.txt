Neres is a graduate of São Paulo's youth system and was promoted to the first team in 2016. He joined Ajax in January 2017. At Ajax, Neres established himself as one of the best young wingers in Europe, after winning a domestic double and being instrumental part of Ajax's first UEFA Champions League semi-final appearance in 22 years, in a breakthrough 2018–19 season. The following seasons, were marked by continuous injuries resulted in Neres playing a limited amount of games and declining in performances, leading him to move to Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk, and then transferred to Benfica for €15.3 million. After representing Brazil at various youth levels, Neres was called up to the full international team for the first time in March 2019, and was part of the squad that took part won the 2019 Copa América. Born in São Paulo, Neres joined São Paulo's youth setup in September 2007, aged ten.

Neres was promoted to the main squad by manager Ricardo Gomes in August 2016. He made his first team – and Série A debut – on 17 October, coming on as a second-half substitute for Robson in a 2–1 away win against Fluminense. On 22 October 2016 Neres scored his first goal, netting the last in a 2–0 home win against Ponte Preta.

The deal added a further year to his prior deal that was set to expire in 2022. At the start of the 2020–21 season, Neres came back after his injury. On November 22, he scored his first goal in more than a year. Since Ajax acquired Mohamed Daramy and Steven Berghuis as wingers at the beginning of the season, competition for Neres increased, as a result of which he was often no longer included in the starting lineup. On 11 January 2022 it was reported that Neres was sold to Ukrainian Premier League side Shakhtar Donetsk for a reported fee of €15 million, which can potentially run up to €17 million with bonuses.

The net cost of the transaction was only €300,000, with both Benfica and Shakhtar settling an agreement for the latter's debt, due to the transfer of compatriot and former teammate Pedrinho, which whom Shakhtar had only paid €3 million of a total of €18 million.
