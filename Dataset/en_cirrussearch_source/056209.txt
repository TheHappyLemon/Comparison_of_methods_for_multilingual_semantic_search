Kilpisjärvi is a medium-sized lake located at the north-western tip of Finland and northernmost Sweden. Treriksröset, the point where the borders of Finland, Sweden and Norway join is located some 2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) northwest from the lake. The lake is divided into two parts, Kilpisjärvi (Northern Sami: Bajit Gilbbesjávri) and Alajärvi (Vuolit Gilbbesjávri). Being located on the Scandinavian Mountains, the lake is surrounded by numerous fells, most notably Saana. The northern location and high elevation cause the lake to be frozen most of the year.[citation needed] Kilpisjärvi–Alajärvi in Järviwiki Web Service. Finnish Environment Institute.
