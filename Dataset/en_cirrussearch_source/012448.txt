His elevated play helped the Senator's back into the Stanley Cup playoffs, though they lost in 7 games to the New York Rangers in the Eastern Conference quarter finals. During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Phillips acted as the Senators' NHLPA team representative and was close to the negotiations. He was critical of how the NHL presented their definition of hockey related revenue (HRR), a major issue in the ongoing labour dispute. "Basically, they changed the definition, where there would be no accountability in terms of HRR accounting, so they could basically give us whatever number they wanted to", Phillips was quoted as saying. Other players such as Josh Gorges and Brian Gionta shared Phillips' view. Phillips accused the NHL of "dirty tricks" which were hindering negotiations. On March 5, 2014, Phillips signed a two-year contract extension worth $2.5 million with the Ottawa Senators. On February 5, 2015, Phillips played in his 1,179th career game as a member of the Ottawa Senators. This marked a new franchise record, previously held by former team captain Daniel Alfredsson, for most games played for the club. In the summer of 2015, while attempting to return to hockey, Phillips suffered a crack in a disc in his back, rendering him unable to participate in the Ottawa Senators training camp.

The Senators Community Foundation was established to replace the role of the Ottawa Senators Foundation, which had ended its longstanding relationship with the team in July 2020. In July 2021, Phillips resigned as executive director of the Senators Community Foundation after a disagreement with owner Eugene Melnyk. In September 2022, after Melnyk's death, Phillips rejoined the organization as its Vice President of Business Operations, a role in which he would have to repair strained relationships with Ottawa businesses from the Melnyk era.

He is the nephew of retired Edmonton Oilers radio broadcaster Rod Phillips. In September 2012, it was revealed that Phillips was initiating a $7.5-million lawsuit against his former agent, Stacey McAlpine, to recover lost money as a result of bad real estate deals. The suit, launched at the Ontario court in Ottawa, alleges that Phillips was misled by McAlpine and hasn't been able to recover monies invested or access more than $5.5 million of his money being handled by McAlpine. The suit came one month after Phillips' former Ottawa teammate Dany Heatley initiated similar legal proceedings against McAlpine.
