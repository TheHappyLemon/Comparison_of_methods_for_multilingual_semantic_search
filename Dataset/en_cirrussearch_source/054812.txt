Eduardo Celmi Camavinga (born 10 November 2002) is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for La Liga club Real Madrid and the France national team. Known for his athleticism, versatility, and technical ability, he usually plays as a central midfielder, but can also be deployed as a full-back and defensive midfielder. Camavinga began his career in Ligue 1 with Rennes, making his senior debut at the age of 16, and quickly establishing himself as a regular first-team player. In 2021, he signed for Real Madrid for a fee of €31 million, winning a La Liga and UEFA Champions League double in his first season. Born in Angola with Angolan and Congolese descent, Camavinga moved to France at a young age, eventually representing the country at under-21 level. He made his first senior appearance for the France national team in 2020 at the age of 17, becoming the nation's youngest debutant in over a century. He was part of the French squad that finished runners-up at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Camavinga was born in a refugee camp in Cabinda, Angola in 2002, to an Angolan-Congolese father and a Congolese mother who fled the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He has five siblings. His family moved to France when he was two. They eventually settled in Fougères, where he grew up. He did judo for a time before giving it up to focus solely on football. In 2013, the Camavingas' house was burnt down, destroying most of the family's property. Camavinga stated that this was a source of motivation that pushed him to pursue a career in football and help his family. On 7 July 2020, he obtained the Baccalauréat ES (Economic and Social) without mention. Camavinga joined Rennes' youth system when he was 11. He signed his first professional contract on 14 December 2018, at the age of 16 years and one month, becoming the youngest ever professional for the club at that time. He made his professional debut for Rennes in a 3–3 Ligue 1 tie with Angers on 6 April 2019, becoming the youngest player to ever play for Rennes' first team, at 16 years and six months old. On 18 August 2019, Camavinga recorded an assist and was awarded the man of the match award in a 2–1 win against Paris Saint-Germain. Hence, he became the youngest player to make an assist in Ligue 1, aged 16 years and 281 days. He then won the UNFP Player of the Month award that month, to be the youngest player to achieve this feat. He scored his first goal for Rennes in a 1–0 win against Lyon on 15 December 2019, in the 89th minute of the game. In the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League, he featured in four matches for Rennes against Krasnodar, Chelsea and Sevilla. On 31 August 2021, Real Madrid announced the signing of Camavinga until 30 June 2027. He made his debut in a 5–2 win over Celta Vigo on 12 September 2021, in which he scored a goal shortly after coming off the bench. Three days later, on 15 September 2021, he made his Champions League debut for Real Madrid, coming on as a substitute for Luka Modrić in the 80th minute and assisting Rodrygo for the winner against Inter Milan. On 5 March 2022, during a league match against Real Sociedad, Camavinga struck a game-changing goal. Five minutes before halftime, he launched a powerful 25-meter shot with his left foot that rebounded off the post and into the net, helping level the score in a match that Los Blancos would ultimately win 4–1 at home. On 28 May 2022, Camavinga made a substitute appearance in the 85th minute of the 2022 UEFA Champions League final, helping Real Madrid win 1–0 over Liverpool to earn the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League title with his team. On 9 May 2023, he provided an assist to Vinícius Júnior to take the lead in a 1–1 draw against Manchester City in the Champions League semi-final first leg at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, to be the youngest in the competition's semi-finals to do so, aged 20 years and 180 days. On 7 November 2023, Real Madrid announced the extension of Camavinga's contract, which is to remain effective until 30 June 2029. On 31 October 2019, Camavinga obtained French nationality, benefiting from the collective effect connected to the naturalization of his father. Until then, Camavinga had been a national of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Six days later, he was selected to represent France's under-21 team for games against Georgia and Switzerland, after Matteo Guendouzi was called up to the senior team. On 27 August 2020, Camavinga was called up to play on France's senior team after Paul Pogba was sidelined by a positive COVID-19 test. He became, in the process, the youngest player to be called up to the French senior team since René Gérard in 1932, who was only 17 years, nine months and 17 days old. On 8 September, he debuted in a 4–2 win against Croatia in the UEFA Nations League, replacing N'Golo Kanté midway through the second half. In doing so he became the youngest player to play for the France national team, following Maurice Gastiger in 1914 at 17 years, nine months, and 29 days old. On 7 October 2020, Camavinga made his first start for France in a 7–1 win against Ukraine where he scored his first international goal, opening the scoring with an overhead kick. This made him the youngest goalscorer for France since Maurice Gastiger in 1914. On 25 June 2021, Camavinga was named in Sylvain Ripoll's 18-man France squad for the Summer Olympics in 2021. However he was later removed from the squad after his club, Rennes, objected. In November 2022, he was named in the French squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
