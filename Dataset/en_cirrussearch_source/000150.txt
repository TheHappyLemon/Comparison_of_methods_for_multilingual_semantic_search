The Canada women's national basketball team (French: Équipe du Canada de basketball féminine) represents Canada in international basketball competitions. They are overseen by Canada Basketball, the governing body for basketball in Canada. The Canada women's national basketball team participated in basketball at the 2015 Pan American Games held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada from July 10 to 26, 2015. Canada opened the preliminary rounds with an easy 101–38 win over Venezuela. The following day they beat Argentina 73–58. The final preliminary game was against Cuba; both teams were 2–0, so the winner would win the group. The game went down to the wire with Canada eking out a 71–68 win. Canada would face Brazil in the semi-final. Canada opened the semi-final with an 11–2 run on seven consecutive points by Miranda Ayim. Miah-Marie Langlois contributed five assists. In the third quarter Canada strongly out rebounded Brazil and hit 69% of their field goals to score 33 points in the quarter. Lizanne Murphy and Nirra Fields hit three-pointers to help extend the lead to 68–39 at the end of three-quarters. Canada continued to dominate in the fourth quarter with three-pointers by Nurse and Kim Gaucher. Canada went on to win the game 91–63 to earn a spot in the gold-medal game against the United States. The gold-medal game matched up the host team Canada against the United States, in a sold-out arena dominated by fans in red and white and waving the Canadian flag. The Canadian team, arm in arm, sang "O Canada" as the respective national anthems were played. After trading baskets early the U.S. edged out to a double-digit lead in the second quarter. However the Canadians, with the home crowd cheering, tied up the game at halftime. In the third quarter Canada outscored the U.S. 26–15. The lead would reach as high as 18 points. The U.S. would fight back, but not all the way and Canada won the game and the gold-medal 81–73. It was Canada's first gold-medal in basketball in the Pan American games. Kia Nurse was the star for Canada with 33 points, hitting 11 of her 12 free-throw attempts in 10 of her 17 field-goal attempts including two of three three-pointers. Canada participated at the 2015 FIBA Americas Women's Championship, a qualifying event used to determine invitations to the 2016 Olympics. The games were held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in August 2015. Canada was assigned to Group A and played Puerto Rico, Chile, the Dominican Republic and Cuba in the preliminary rounds. Canada won the first three games easily with a 94–57 win over Puerto Rico as the closest match. The final preliminary round game was against undefeated Cuba, a team Canada had faced in the Pan American games. Cuba played well in that event and was expected to challenge Canada. However, Canada defeated Cuba 92–43 to win first place in the group for a spot in the semi-final against the second-place team in group B, Brazil. The semi-final game against Brazil was much closer. Canada led by only six points at halftime but gradually expanded the lead to end up with an 83–66 win, and a spot in the gold-medal game. The gold-medal game was a rematch with Cuba who won their semi-final game against Argentina. Despite the lopsided result in the preliminary rounds, Canada expected a closer game. Cuba started off strong and had an eight-point lead early in the game. Canada responded with a 16–0 run to take over the lead, but Cuba responded and took a small lead early in the second half. Then Canada took the lead back and gradually expanded the lead to end up with the win, 82–66. As the game wound down to the close, the crowd was chanting "Rio","Rio","Rio" in recognition of the fact that the win qualifies Canada for the Olympics in Rio in 2016. Coming off a gold medal at the 13th edition of the FIBA Women's AmeriCup, Canada entered the 2017 FIBA Women's AmeriCup as favourites. They finished group play with a 4–0 record, and advanced to the semifinals. In the finals, they would beat host nation Argentina 65–67 to win their second straight title. Nirra Fields was named MVP of the tournament. By virtue of finishing top three, they also qualified for 2018 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup. The Canadians made their debut at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast, narrowly missing out on a podium finish, losing to New Zealand 74–68 in the third place game. Trying to build off their third best showing at FIBA's premier international tournament, Canada entered the 2018 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup being drawn in Group A, with France, Greece, and South Korea. Canada went as far as the quarterfinals, where they lost 53–68 to Spain. Canada had one last change to qualify for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, participating at the 2020 FIBA Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments – Ostend. Canada would go on to top their group and qualified to the 2020 Summer Olympics. In Tokyo, Canada were drawn to Group A with Spain, Serbia, and South Korea. They would finish with a 1–2 record with their only win against South Korea. With the approaching 2022 FIBA Women's World Cup, Canada Basketball hired Fenerbahçe head coach Víctor Lapeña to lead its women's program through the World Cup and possibly the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. At the 19th edition of the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, Canada was drawn in Group B. They ended group play with a 4–1 record, with their only loss being to group leaders Australia. In the knockout stage, Canada advanced all the way to the semifinals where they would eventually lose 43–83 to the United States. In the third place game, Canada fell 95-65 to Australia. The 4th place finish was Team Canada's best showing since winning bronze at the 1986 FIBA World Championship for Women. With her efforts in the tournament, Bridget Carleton was named to the All-Tournament Team. In 2023, Canada participated at the 2023 FIBA Women's AmeriCup, where they were drawn into Group B. In the preliminary round, they would go on to top their group with a perfect 4–0 record, advancing to the quarterfinals. In the knockout stage, they would beat Argentina, and then lose a nail-biter to the United States, in the semifinals. In the third place game, Canada would beat Puerto Rico 73–80 to win the bronze medal. By finishing as one of the top five teams in the tournament, Canada qualified to the FIBA Americas Women's Olympic Pre-Qualifying Tournament. 1976 – 6th place 1984 – 4th place 1996 – 11th place 2000 – 10th place 2012 – 8th place 2016 – 7th place 2020 – 9th place 2024 – Qualified 1971 – 10th place 1975 – 11th place 1979 – Third place 1983 – 9th place 1986 – Third place 1990 – 7th place 1994 – 7th place 2006 – 11th place 2010 – 12th place 2014 – 5th place 2018 – 7th place 2022 – 4th place 1989 – Third place 1993 – Third place 1995 – First place 1997 – 5th place 1999 – Third place 2001 – 4th place 2003 – Third place 2005 – Third place 2007 – 5th place 2009 – Third place 2011 – Third place 2013 – Second place 2015 – First place 2017 – First place 2019 – Second place 2021 – 4th place 2023 – Third place 1955 – 5th place 1959 – 4th place 1963 – 4th place 1967 – Third place 1971 – 5th place 1975 – 5th place 1979 – Third place 1983 – 4th place 1987 – Third place 1991 – 4th place 1995 – Cancelled 1999 – Second place 2003 – 4th place 2007 – 4th place 2011 – 6th place 2015 – First place 2019 – 6th place 2018 – 4th place   Win   Loss   Fixture Canada  v  Mexico  Puerto Rico v Canada  Canada  v  Colombia  Dominican Republic v Canada  Canada  v  Argentina Canada  v  United States  Puerto Rico v Canada  Hungary  v  Canada Canada  v  Spain Canada  v  Japan Roster for the 2023 FIBA Women's AmeriCup.
