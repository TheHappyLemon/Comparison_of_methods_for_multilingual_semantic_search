Beyhan Sultan (Ottoman Turkish: بگخان سلطان; died 1557) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Selim I and Hafsa Sultan. She was the sister of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Beyhan married Ferhad Pasha after the Belgrade campaign in 1521. Ferhad, initially served as the third vizier, and contributed essential military expertise to Suleiman during the early years of his reign. However, a turning point emerged upon Suleiman's return from Rhodes in 1523, triggering accusations against Ferhad, ranging from misappropriation of property to mismanagement of the sultan's troops. Rather than opting for execution, Suleiman, potentially influenced by intercession from Hafsa and Beyhan, chose to demote Ferhad to the distant district governorship of Semendire. This geographical separation aimed to mitigate perceived threats to Constantinople, but Ferhad's fortunes further soured when his forces suffered a defeat by the Hungarians near Semendire in August 1523, leading to his dismissal from all positions. Despite these setbacks, Hafsa and Beyhan's persistent intercession secured an audience for Ferhad with Suleiman in November 1524, in Edirne. Unfortunately, Ferhad's efforts to convince Suleiman of his innocence proved futile. Frustration boiled over during the meeting, with Ferhad vehemently declaring himself a victim of a high-level conspiracy. Suleiman, compelled to act, ordered Ferhad's removal. Ferhad's continued protests, combined with the brandishing of a dagger, escalated the situation, resulting in his imprisonment and eventual execution by decapitation. Suleiman, reportedly intending only imprisonment, found himself forced into a more severe response due to Ferhad's violent behavior. The aftermath of Ferhad's execution left Beyhan inconsolable, severing ties with Suleiman as she chose seclusion, marking the beginning of a permanent estrangement between them. Refusing to remarry, she lived in self-exile from Constantinople. She died in 1557, and was buried in her own mausoleum in the courtyard of Sultan Murad Mosque in Skopje. In the TV series Muhteşem Yüzyıl, Beyhan Sultan is portrayed by Turkish actress Pınar Çağlar Gençtürk. Şahin, K. (2023). Peerless Among Princes: The Life and Times of Sultan Süleyman.
