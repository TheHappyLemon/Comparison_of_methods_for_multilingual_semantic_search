Linitskaja and others begins here. 1887 – Opening of the newly built theatre on November 8, named the Concert Hall (subsequently Winter Theatre).

Hundreds of civilians were apparently sheltering in the building at the time. Satellite imagery taken prior to and immediately after the attack showed the Russian word for children, "Дети," painted on the ground at the front and rear of the building, to inform Russian military planes that children were sheltering in the building. On March 17, Dario Franceschini, Italian Minister of Culture informed on his Twitter page that the Cabinet of Ministers of Italy had approved his proposal to offer Ukraine the resources and means to rebuild the theatre as soon as possible. The Associated Press estimated that as many as 600 people were killed in the attack. Wikimedia Commons has media related to Theatre of Mariupol.
