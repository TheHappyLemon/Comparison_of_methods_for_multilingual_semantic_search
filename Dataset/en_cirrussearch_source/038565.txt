Šaštín-Stráže (German: Schoßberg-Strascha, Hungarian: Sasvár–Morvaőr, Turkish: Şaşvar) is a town in the Senica District, Trnava Region in western Slovakia. Originally two separate villages, now it is one of the youngest towns in Slovakia, having received town privileges on 1 September 2001. The name "Šaštín" consists of two parts: šáš (šašina, šáchor, present also in other Slavic languages – a sedge) and týn (initially a fence, later also a small medieval fort). The name Stráže (guards) refers to a historic settlement of border guards. The town lies in the Záhorie lowlands, around 18 km (11 mi) from Senica and 65 km (40 mi) from Bratislava. The Myjava River flows through the town, dividing the town's two parts. The first written mention about Šaštín-Stráže was in 1218. Although the town's two parts, Šaštín and Stráže nad Myjavou were for long two separate villages, their history is closely connected to each other. The villages merged in 1961 under name Šaštínske Stráže, changed in 1971 to the current name. According to the 2001 census, the town had 5,005 inhabitants. 95.44% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 2.06% Roma and 1.50% Czechs. The religious makeup was 88.45% Roman Catholics, 7.31% people with no religious affiliation, and 1.34% Lutherans. Šaštín-Stráže is one of the most important Marian shrines in Slovakia.
