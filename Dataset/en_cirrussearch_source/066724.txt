Yuri Shefler (Russian: Юрий Викторович Шефлер; born 10 September 1967) is a Russian, British and Israeli billionaire businessman. He is the owner of SPI Group, an international consortium that sells alcohol in 160 countries, most notably the Stolichnaya vodka brand. As of March 2022, his net worth was estimated at US$1.5 billion. Shefler left the Soviet Army in September 1987. In the early 1990s, as a student, he was engaged in vouchers and petty trade. Co-founded the Sadko-Arkada (Садко-Аркада) trading house , became a shareholder and headed Vnukovo Airlines, Nafta-Moscow (Нафта Москва), GUM and TSUM.[citation needed] He used to own one of the largest yachts in the world, Serene, with a length of 133.9 m (439 ft 4 in). In 2015 he sold Serene to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for a reported $550 million. In March 2017 he bought Tulchan Estate on Speyside, Scotland's most expensive sporting estate. On 17 February 2022, Brad Pitt said that Angelina Jolie sold to Shefler's wine group Tenute del Mondo, which is a subsidiary of Shefler's Stoli Group, her interest in the Château Miraval at Correns in Provence, France, which Pitt and Jolie purchased in 2008 for $28.4 million. SPI Group produces and sells alcohol under 380 brands in 160 countries, most notably Stolichnaya vodka. SPI Group also owns Louisiana Spirits Company, Fabrica de Tequilas Finos in Mexico and Achaval Ferrer in Argentina. Shefler's SPI Group has been involved in a decades-long dispute with Russian state-owned company FKP Sojuzplodoimport (FKP) over who owns the Stolichnaya and Moskovskaya trademarks. In 2020 the Dutch Supreme Court ruled that the rights belonged to Russia and ordered SPI Group to stop selling its products in Benelux. In 2022 Shefler was ordered to pay a former UK executive over £1.6 million after sacking him when he complained about pay cuts. Shefler was born to a Russian Jewish family in Oryol. He has citizenship in the United Kingdom and Israel. He was formerly married to Tatiana Kovylina, a Russian model who once worked for Victoria's Secret, until their split in 2021. They have four children together, and lived together in Geneva, Switzerland. He has since been linked to Ksenia Sukhinova, who was Miss Russia 2007, and Miss World 2008. As reported by Forbes in March 2022, Shefler had an estimated net worth of $1.5 billion. "Bloomberg - Vodka Drinkers Are Changing Brands in Wake of Ukraine Invasion". www.bloomberg.com.
