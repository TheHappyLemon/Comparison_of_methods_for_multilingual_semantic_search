Vana Tallinn (Literal translation: "Old Tallinn") is an Estonian brand of liqueur manufactured continuously by Liviko since 1960. The recipe contains Jamaican rum and a variety of herbs and spices. Vana Tallinn is typically served on the rocks but may also be used for cocktails, food, coffee or mulled wine.[citation needed] The recipe for Vana Tallinn (45% vol) was invented in 1960 by the master distiller Ilse Maar, the bottling manager Bernhard Jürno and the distillery specialist Jaan Siimo. Vana Tallinn (45% vol) was the only drink in the Vana Tallinn product family until 1999, with liqueurs with an alcohol content of 40% and 50% vol added at a later time. More than 115 million bottles of Vana Tallinn liqueur have been sold since the production began in 1960. As of 2022, Vana Tallinn liqueur is sold in 60 countries around the world. In 2018 Liviko announced they started to export Vana Tallinn to Spain, and in 2019 to India.
