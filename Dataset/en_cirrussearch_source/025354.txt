49 (forty-nine) is the natural number following 48 and preceding 50. Forty-nine is the square of the prime number seven and hence the fourth non-unitary square prime of the form p2 49 has an aliquot sum of 8; itself a prime power, and hence an aliquot sequence of two composite members (49, 8, 7,1,0). It appears in the Padovan sequence, preceded by the terms 21, 28, 37 (it is the sum of the first two of these). Along with the number that immediately derives from it, 77, the only number under 100 not having its home prime known (as of 2016[update]). The smallest triple of three squares in arithmetic succession is (1,25,49), and the second smallest is (49,169,289). 49 is the smallest discriminant of a totally real cubic field. The sum of the digits of the square of 49 (2401) is the square root of 49. 49 is the first square where the digits are squares. In this case, 4 and 9 are squares. The fraction 1/49 is a repeating decimal with a period of 42: 1/49 = 0.0204081632 6530612244 8979591836 7346938775 51 (42 digits repeat) There are 42 positive integers less than 49 and coprime to 49. (42 is the period.) Multiplying 020408163265306122448979591836734693877551 by each of these integers results in a cyclic permutation of the original number: 020408163265306122448979591836734693877551 × 2 = 040816326530612244897959183673469387755102 020408163265306122448979591836734693877551 × 3 = 061224489795918367346938775510204081632653 020408163265306122448979591836734693877551 × 4 = 081632653061224489795918367346938775510204 ... The repeating number can be obtained from 02 and repetition of doubles placed at two places to the right: 02 04 08 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 + ... ---------------------- 020408163265306122448979591836734693877551...0204081632... because 1⁄49 satisfies: x=150+2x100=150(1+x).{\displaystyle x={\frac {1}{50}}+{\frac {2x}{100}}={\frac {1}{50}}(1+x)\,.} The atomic number of indium.
