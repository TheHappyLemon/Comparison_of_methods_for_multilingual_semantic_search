In 1997, while performing in Another World, Rhodes was nominated, along with Mark Pinter, for a Soap Opera Digest Award as "Favorite New Couple". For Rhodes's first Another World fan club luncheon, she rewrote the lyrics for "All For the Best" from Godspell. Prior to her Disney Channel début, she had previously acted with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival for one season, portraying the roles of "Daphne Stillington" in Noël Coward's Present Laughter and "Helena" in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. In 2005, Rhodes was cast as Carey Martin on The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. Her character was notorious for her spiky blonde hair and her can-do attitude. She later reprised her role with several cameo appearances on the spin-off series The Suite Life on Deck from 2008 to 2011.[citation needed] In 2010, she was cast as Sheriff Jody Mills on the CW's show Supernatural. She first appeared in Season 5; episode "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid", with her character appearing in every season since as a guest star. In 2018, Season 13; episode “Wayward Sisters“ was used as a backdoor pilot for a possible spin-off series of the same name, intended to feature Rhodes and fellow actresses Briana Buckmaster and Kathryn Newton as the main characters. The new series ultimately did not move forward. Rhodes performs, alongside other Supernatural's cast members, in Jason Manns' 2018 album "Recovering With Friends."
