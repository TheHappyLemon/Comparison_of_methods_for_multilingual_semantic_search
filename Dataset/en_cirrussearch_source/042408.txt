The World Championship of Drivers has been held since 1950. Driver records listed here include all rounds which formed part of the World Championship since 1950: this includes the Indianapolis 500 from 1950–1960 (although it was not run to Formula One rules), and the 1952 and 1953 World Championship Grands Prix (which were run to Formula Two rules). Formula One races that were not qualification rounds for the World Championship are not included, and sprints are only included when specified. Drivers are considered to be entered into a race if they attempt to compete in at least one official practice session with the intent of participating in the race. These drivers are noted on the entry list for that race. A driver is considered to have started a race if they line up on the grid or at the pit lane exit for the start of the race. If a race is stopped and restarted, participation in any portion of the race is counted only if that portion was in any way counted towards the final classification (e.g. races stopped before the end of the leader's second lap were declared null and void prior to 2005). (Only the most consecutive races that the driver entered and started are listed) Notes † Not counting Petronas engines that were rebadged Ferrari power units of earlier seasons. Notes Bruce McLaren won the 1959 United States Grand Prix in the first season (1959) in which he drove a Formula One car; he had entered in two championship races in the 1958 season driving a Formula Two car on both occasions. (Only the first win for each driver is listed) (Only the last win for each driver is listed) Notes Luigi Fagioli is the only World Championship race winner born in the 19th century. (Only the first pole position for each driver is listed) Notes Michael Schumacher was aged 43 years, 144 days when he set the fastest time in qualifying for the 2012 Monaco Grand Prix; he did not start the race from pole position due to a 5-place grid penalty incurred from the previous race, the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix. Notes This table deliberately only goes down to 4th place and 4 consecutive fastest laps because more than 20 drivers have set 3 consecutive fastest laps. (Only the first fastest lap for each driver is listed) (Only the last fastest lap for each driver is listed) (Only the first podium finish for each driver is listed) (Only the last podium finish for each driver is listed) Throughout the history of the World Championship, the points-scoring positions and the number of points awarded to each position have varied, along with the number of events per season in which points could be scored. Notes † Double points awarded in last race. Notes † Double points awarded in last race. (Only the first points finish for each driver is listed) (Only the last points finish for each driver is listed) (Only the first race led for each driver is listed) (Only the last race led for each driver is listed) This is sometimes referred to as a "hat-trick" or "hat trick". Notes The most hat-tricks by a driver in a single season is 6, achieved by Verstappen in 2023 (Spain, Austria, UK, Japan, Qatar and Abu Dhabi). Eleven drivers have achieved a hat-trick in consecutive races. Ascari is the only one to have achieved four in a row (Germany 1952–Argentina 1953). All other drivers stopped at two consecutive hat-tricks. Verstappen has achieved a hat-trick in consecutive races three times (Austria–Britain 2023; Japan–Qatar 2023; and Abu Dhabi 2023–Bahrain 2024). Three drivers have achieved a hat-trick in consecutive races twice. Ascari (Belgium–France 1952; and Germany 1952–Argentina 1953), Clark (Netherlands–France 1963; and Mexico 1967–South Africa 1968) and Häkkinen (Australia–Brazil 1998; and Spain–Monaco 1998). The other seven drivers to have achieved a hat-trick in two consecutive races are Brabham (Belgium–France 1960), Laffite (Argentina–Brazil 1979), Mansell (France–Britain 1992), Schumacher (United States–France 2006), Massa (Bahrain–Spain 2007), Alonso (Italy–Singapore 2010), Vettel (Singapore–Korea 2013) and Hamilton (Italy-Singapore 2014). This is sometimes referred to as a "grand slam" or "grand chelem". Notes Three drivers have achieved a grand slam in consecutive races: Ascari (Germany–Netherlands 1952), Clark (Netherlands–France 1963), and Vettel (Singapore–Korea 2013). Four drivers have achieved a grand slam three times in a single season: Ascari (France, Germany, Netherlands 1952), Clark (Netherlands, France, Mexico 1963; and South Africa, France, Germany 1965), Mansell (South Africa, Spain, Britain 1992) and Hamilton (China, Canada, Britain 2017). Three drivers have achieved at least one grand slam in each of four Formula One seasons: Clark (1962, 1963, 1964, 1965), Hamilton (2014, 2015, 2017, 2019) and Verstappen (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024). Clark (1962–1965) and Verstappen (2021–2024) are the only drivers who have achieved at least one grand slam in each of four consecutive seasons, followed by Vettel (2011–2013) with three seasons, and Ascari (1952–1953), Stewart (1971–1972), Piquet (1980–1981), Senna (1989–1990), Mansell (1991–1992), and Hamilton (2014–2015) with two seasons. (Excluding drivers who competed from the very first championship season of 1950; including winning season) (At the moment they clinched their first/only title) (At the moment they clinched their second title) (At the moment they clinched their third title) (At the moment they clinched the title) (At the moment they clinched their only/last title) List of Formula One drivers List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions The Indianapolis 500 was a round of the World Drivers' Championship 11 times (from 1950 to 1960). Drivers competing in the Indianapolis 500 during these years were credited with participation in a World Championship race and the top five finishers were credited with World Championship points. Fangio entered 52 separate races and started 51 of them, but in 7 Grands Prix (1950 Italian, 1951 French, 1953 Belgian, 1953 Swiss, 1956 Argentine, 1956 Monaco and 1956 Italian) shared 5 cars (all mentioned but 1950 Italian and 1953 Belgian) with other drivers which would reduce his percentages to 41.38%. Ascari entered 33 separate races and started 32 of them, but in 3 Grands Prix (1950 Italian, 1951 French and 1953 German) shared 3 drives with 1 additional car (in latter with Luigi Villoresi) which would reduce his percentages to 37.14%. Some sources extend Ascari's sequence to 9 wins, including the subsequent 1953 Dutch and Belgian Grands Prix and discounting the intervening 1953 Indianapolis 500, on the basis that very few of the European drivers competed in the Indianapolis 500 when it was part of the Drivers' Championship. Fangio began racing in Grands Prix in 1948 – before the first World Championship. Farina began racing in Grands Prix in the 1930s – before the first World Championship. Shared drive with Stirling Moss A year after the victory, Renault were charged with race fixing, which led to the team's suspended disqualification; however, the original results were left in place. Fangio entered 52 separate races, but shared 6 cars with other drivers in 5 Grands Prix which would reduce his percentages accordingly. Ascari entered 33 separate races, but shared 3 cars with other drivers in 3 Grands Prix which would reduce his percentages accordingly. Farina's total of 20 podiums includes both 2nd and 3rd places at the 1955 Argentine Grand Prix. Brundle's first podium would have been his 7th start in 8th entries at the 1984 Detroit Grand Prix had not Tyrell been disqualified and the team's results for the season cancelled. Including sprint points. See talk page for supporting calculation. Autosport listed it as 998. Some sources give him 50 starts, others give him 51 starts. This includes partial seasons. Alonso did not compete in the 2002 World Championship as he spent the season as Renault's test driver, so he won the World Championship in the fourth season he contested. Andretti did not compete in the 1973 World Championship, so he won the World Championship in the tenth season he contested. Verstappen won the 2023 World Championship at the Qatar sprint race, before racing at the Grand Prix. Sprint races do not count to the tally of this record. In 2003–2009 scoring format: 104 (210 vs. 106); in 1991–2002 scoring format: 129 (204 vs. 75) Excluding the 1950 World Championship. All of Hulme's eight career wins were not from pole position. The only other driver to have at least five race wins not from pole position is John Watson. Hulme won the 1967 World Championship without ever having scored a pole, although six years later, in 1973, Hulme racked up the solitary pole of his 112-race career. In 2019–present scoring format: 267; in 2010–2018 scoring format: 265 The other longest gaps are Luca Badoer (9 years, 9 months, 23 days), Gene Force (9 years), Pete Lovely (8 years, 10 months), and Robert Kubica (8 years, 4 months, 3 days). Some sources extend it to 62, not considering the 2010 Spanish Grand Prix that Kovalainen did not start. Some sources attribute the record at 148 due to some conjecture over whether it is 147 or 148 retirements for De Cesaris because he ran out of fuel and pushed his car over the line at the 1987 Belgian Grand Prix to finish third. Some sources listed De Cesaris's sequence to 22 retirements, starting from the 1986 Australian Grand Prix to the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix and including the 1987 Belgian, 1987 Australian, and 1988 Canadian Grands Prix on the basis that he did not complete the races. Button was given a drive-through penalty for speeding behind the safety car. Rathmann started 32nd and finished 2nd at the 1957 Indianapolis 500. Vettel recorded speeding in pit lane six seconds into his career as a Formula One driver. Loof started one World Championship race at the 1953 German Grand Prix but only made it two metres off the starting grid. The 1952 and 1953 World Championships were run to Formula Two regulations; however, World Championship and Formula One are commonly referred to synonymously and are treated as such for these records. Marco Apicella, who raced a mere 800 metres (2,600 ft) at the 1993 Italian Grand Prix, is frequently referred to as having the shortest Formula One career but that is a technicality.
