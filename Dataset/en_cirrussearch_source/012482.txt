Dana's classification is a mineral classification developed by James Dwight Dana. It is based on the chemical composition and structure of minerals. It is mainly used in English-speaking countries, especially in the United States. The mineral classification used by the International Mineralogical Association is the Nickel-Strunz classification. The classification of minerals was based on chemical composition by Dana in the fourth edition (1854, in two volumes) of his book System of Mineralogy. For the 20th century, this classification was completed thanks to scientific progress, particularly in the field of crystallography. In 1941, Karl Hugo Strunz used it to construct his classification. Dana's original classification was further developed, and a new classification was published in 1997. Minerals are arranged in a hierarchical system. Each mineral has a classification number, made up of four numbers separated by dots, enabling unambiguous identification even when minerals are known by several names (synonymy). The first number represents the mineral class. The second number represents the mineral type, in some cases taking into account its atomic structure. The third number represents a group of minerals of similar structure. The fourth number gives the unambiguous identification of the mineral. Kieserite group. 29.
