Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Alpensia Biathlon Centre, Daegwallyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do, South Korea. There were eleven events contested: men and women competed in each of sprint, pursuit, individual, mass start, and relay; there was also a mixed relay event. The eleven events were scheduled to take place between 9 and 23 February 2018. A total of 230 quota spots were available to athletes to compete at the games (115 men and 115 women).
