"Sonne" (German for "sun") is a song by German rock band Rammstein. It was released in February 2001, as the first single from their album Mutter. According to Till Lindemann, the song was originally written as an entrance song for the boxer Vitali Klitschko, whose surname was also the working title of the song. The female vocal comes from Spectrasonic's "Symphony of Voices" sample library. The music video for the band's 2019 single "Deutschland" features a piano-based version of "Sonne" in the ending credits. The video features the band as the Seven Dwarfs mining gold for Snow White. According to Paul Landers in the Making of Sonne, the idea came from a video made by Oliver Riedel, who mixed the song with parts of Snow White. Snow White is played by Russian soap actress Yulia Stepanova. The song debuted as "Klitschko" on 16 April 2000. It was very different from the final version released in Mutter.[citation needed] It was played in some concerts on the Japanese/Australia-New Zealand leg of the Sehnsucht tour, before Mutter was released and its tour started. These concerts were the only time the third verse of the song was played; when played live, the band usually omits the final stanza, and instead plays a slightly longer intro and outro.[citation needed] The single is also available as a 2-track CD, featuring "Sonne" and "Adios".
