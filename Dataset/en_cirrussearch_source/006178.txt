.lb is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Lebanon. The Lebanese Domain Registry (LBDR) was established in 1993. It offered domains free of charge directly to registrants, without the use of a registrar model. Since February 1, 2021, they introduced a registrar model and registrants can't directly register their domains at the registry anymore. At the same time the registry also introduced a yearly fee for domains and removed the trademark requirement for registrants. On July 13, 2023, ICANN took over the registry management of .lb in a caretaker role due to the death of the registry manager. On January 21, 2024, ICANN approved the transfer of .lb to the new registry Internet Society Lebanon. com.lb – commercial edu.lb – educational gov.lb – government net.lb – network infrastructure org.lb – organizations "LB Domain Status - Latest". docs.google.com. isoc.org.lb.
