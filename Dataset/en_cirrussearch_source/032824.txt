Enrico Gasparotto (born 22 March 1982) is an Italian-born Swiss former professional road racing cyclist, who rode professionally between 2005 and 2020, for seven different teams. After retiring, he worked as a directeur sportif for UCI Continental team EF Education–Nippo Development Team in 2021 before joining Bora–Hansgrohe in a similar role the following year. Born in Sacile, Gasparotto turned professional in 2005 with Liquigas–Bianchi and stayed with the team for three years. At the 2007 Giro d'Italia, Gasparotto led his Liquigas squad to a stage 1 team time trial win and wore the pink jersey the following day. Gasparotto achieved his first Classics victory at the 2012 Amstel Gold Race; he won the race in an uphill finish, after Óscar Freire was caught 90 m (300 ft) before the finish line, and Gasparotto out-sprinted Lotto–Belisol's Jelle Vanendert and Peter Sagan of Liquigas–Cannondale. One week later, he took part in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, finishing third by beating a small group to the sprint in a race won by fellow Astana teammate, Maxim Iglinsky. At the Vuelta a España, bad luck hit Gasparotto and the Astana squad on the very first stage, a 16.5 km (10.3 mi) team time trial held in Pamplona. His teammates Paolo Tiralongo, Alexsandr Dyachenko, Andrey Zeits and Gasparotto himself crashed in an accident that was not picked up by the television cameras. His teammates could pick themselves up and continue, as did Gasparotto, but it was revealed that his collarbone was fractured in three places and he had to abandon the Spanish race. Gasparotto took a second Amstel Gold triumph when he won the 2016 edition of the race, defeating Michael Valgren in a two-up sprint after the pair broke away from the main group in the closing stages of the race. It was Gasparotto's first win since his 2012 victory, and he dedicated it to Antoine Demoitié, his teammate who had died after a crash at Gent–Wevelgem the previous month. 2004 1st Stage 5 Giro del Friuli-Venezia Giulia 3rd Gran Premio di Poggiana 2005 1st Road race, Italian National Road Championships 1st Stage 2 Volta a Catalunya 3rd Overall Uniqa Classic 5th Coppa Bernocchi 6th Gran Premio Città di Misano – Adriatico 10th Paris–Tours 2006 1st Memorial Cimurri 3rd Coppa Sabatini 6th Scheldeprijs 2007 Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Held after Stages 1 & 3 2nd Overall Danmark Rundt 4th Brabantse Pijl Vuelta a Mallorca 5th Trofeo Mallorca 9th Trofeo Cala Millor 9th Memorial Cimurri 2008 1st Overall Ster Elektrotoer 1st Stage 3 1st Giro della Romagna 2nd Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 2nd Coppa Placci 3rd Overall Three Days of De Panne 1st Stage 1 3rd Gran Premio di Lugano 4th Trofeo Laigueglia 5th Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli 6th Overall Giro della Provincia di Grosseto 7th Overall Tour du Poitou-Charentes 7th Brabantse Pijl 10th Overall Danmark Rundt 2009 1st Sprints classification, Tour de Suisse 2nd Overall Giro della Provincia di Grosseto 3rd Coppa Bernocchi 8th Memorial Cimurri 2010 1st Stage 5 Tirreno–Adriatico 3rd Amstel Gold Race 9th Montepaschi Strade Bianche 2011 4th Tre Valli Varesine 2012 1st Amstel Gold Race 3rd Liège–Bastogne–Liège 7th Trofeo Laigueglia 2013 5th Giro di Lombardia 6th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 7th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal 9th Amstel Gold Race 2014 8th Amstel Gold Race 8th Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec 9th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal 9th Tre Valli Varesine 2015 8th Amstel Gold Race 8th Grand Prix of Aargau Canton 9th Coppa Ugo Agostoni 2016 1st Amstel Gold Race 2nd Brabantse Pijl 5th La Flèche Wallonne 6th Overall Tour of Belgium 2018 3rd Amstel Gold Race 3rd Gran Premio di Lugano 3rd Coppa Ugo Agostoni 6th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 2019 7th Brabantse Pijl 9th Overall Arctic Race of Norway 10th La Flèche Wallonne "Dimension Data finalise 2019 roster".
