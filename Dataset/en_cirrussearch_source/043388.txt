Fabián represented Mexico in several youth categories before reaching a full cap with the senior team.

In 2012, as a competitor of the Mexico U-23 national team, Fabián helped Mexico qualify to the 2012 Summer Olympics and win the 2012 Toulon Tournament, where he was the top scorer.

On 26 December 2014, after his loan deal expired, Cruz Azul opted not to exercise their purchase option due to Fabián's high expense. He subsequently returned to Guadalajara and was assigned the number 33 shirt, since his preferred number 10 had since been taken; 33 was the same kit number he used when he made his professional debut in 2007. In his return to the Omnilife Stadium, on 18 January, Fabián scored his first goal of the Clausura 2015 tournament against UNAM in a 2–1 home victory.

During the final, he almost netted an over-head bicycle kick goal but it struck the post, though he did provide an assist for Oribe Peralta's second goal of the match. Mexico would win the match 2–1 and thus win the Olympic goal medal. He played the entire tournament as Mexico's second striker behind Peralta, and created a successful offensive deplete with him throughout the tournament.

During the Gold Cup 2011, Fabián was named as one of the replacements for the five players who tested positive for clenbuterol, but would only be called to join them in an emergency, because he was already in concentration with the under-22 squad in preparation for the Copa América.
