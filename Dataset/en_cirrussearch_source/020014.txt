Svenska Cellulosa AB (SCA, English: Swedish Cellulose Company) is a Swedish timber, pulp and paper manufacturer with headquarters in Sundsvall. It has approximately 3,300 employees and a turnover of approximately SEK 20.8 billion (€1.8 billion). Its main products include many one-use paper products, containerboard, solid-wood products, pulp and forest-based biofuel. SCA is Europe's largest private owner of forest land, with 2.7 million hectares. The global hygiene product company Essity was part of SCA until 2017. SCA was founded by Ivar Kreuger on 27 November 1929 as a holding company for ten Swedish forest industry companies. Following Kreuger's bankruptcy in 1932, the company came to be controlled by the bank Handelsbanken, who along with associated funds and companies continue to control SCA. Axel Enström was the managing director from 1950 to 1960 and chairman of the board from 1960 to 1965. In 1975 SCA acquired Mölnlycke, a leading western European producer of disposable hygiene products, and in 1990 SCA acquired transport packaging company Reedpack. In 1995 the Germany-based paper and packaging company PWA was acquired. In 2001 the division Wisconsin Tissue of the United States company Georgia-Pacific Tissue was acquired. In 2007, SCA bought the European business of Procter & Gamble, significantly expanding its hygiene product business. In 2008 SCA increases ownership in Chinese tissue company Vinda. In 2012 SCA divested its packaging operations – excluding the two kraftliner mills in Sweden – to DS Smith. In August 2015 it was announced that SCA was to invest in increased capacity for mass production at the Östrand pulp mill in Timrå, Sweden. The annual production capacity of bleached sulphate pulp was to increase from approximately 430 000 tonnes to 900 000 tonnes. The investment amounted to approximately SEK 7.8 billion (€815m) and was expected to be one of the largest industrial investment in the history of Norrland. In August 2015 it was announced that SCA's hygiene operations and forest operations were to be divided into two different divisions. A year later, 24 August 2016, the company announced that it intended to split SCA into two separately listed companies. In 2017 the company Essity was formed and was introduced on the Stock Exchange in Stockholm. In September 2021, St1 and SCA announced their half-owned joint ventures St1 Gothenburg Biorefinery AB and SCA Östrand Biorefinery.
