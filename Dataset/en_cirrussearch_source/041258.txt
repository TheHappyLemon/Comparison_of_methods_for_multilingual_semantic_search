At the end of the season, he was a part of the squad which won Copa Sudamericana and Chilean Primera División. On 3 July 2013, Mena signed a one-year loan deal with Brazilian Série A outfit Santos FC, with a buyout clause. He quickly established himself as a starter, and on 5 June of the following year Peixe bought the remaining rights of the player. On 14 January 2015, Mena rescinded his contract Santos, after winning a court case due to unpaid wages. Ten days later he agreed a deal with fellow league team Cruzeiro. On 9 July 2018, he joined Racing Club de Avellaneda. Mena represented Chile national football team U-23 on 2009 Toulon Tournament that finished first, and 2010 Toulon Tournament that finished fourth.
