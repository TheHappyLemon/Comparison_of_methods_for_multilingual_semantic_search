McFarlane Strait is a strait lying between Greenwich Island and Livingston Island, in the South Shetland Islands off Antarctica. It is 24 kilometres (13 nmi) long and 3 kilometres (1.6 nmi) wide. The name appears on an 1822 chart by Captain George Powell, a British sealer, and is now well established in international usage. The strait is centred at (62°32′S 59°55′W﻿ / ﻿62.533°S 59.917°W﻿ / -62.533; -59.917), and entered between Williams Point and Duff Point to the northwest and between Renier Point and Ephraim Bluff to the southeast (British mapping in 1822 and 1968, Chilean mapping in 1971, Argentine mapping in 1980, Spanish mapping in 1991, and Bulgarian mapping in 2005 and 2009).
