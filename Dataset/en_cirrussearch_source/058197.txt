The 1970–71 European Cup was the 16th season of the European Cup, UEFA's premier club football tournament. The competition was won by Ajax, who beat Panathinaikos in the final at Wembley Stadium in London, on 2 June 1971. It was the first time the trophy went to Ajax, beginning a three-year period of domination, and the second consecutive championship for the Netherlands. It was also the first time that a Greek team reached the final. UEFA had introduced for the first time penalty shoot-out as a way of deciding drawn ties – doing away with the unsatisfactory tossing of a coin. They had also decided that the away goals rule should apply to all rounds, and not just the first two, as had been the case. This season marked the first time in European Cup history that Real Madrid failed to qualify for the tournament, having appeared in all 15 previous seasons. Feyenoord, the defending champions, were eliminated by Romanian club UTA Arad in the first round. 18 August 1970 Natsionalen Stadion Vasil Levski, Sofia Attendance: 16,977 Referee: Antonio Sbardella (Italy) 2 September 1970 Praterstadion, Wien Attendance: 15,233 Referee: János Bíróczky (Hungary) Austria Wien won 4–3 on aggregate. 16 September 1970 Stadio Sant'Elia, Cagliari Attendance: 54,918 Referee: Gheorghe Limona (Romania) 16 September 1970 Estadio Manzanares, Madrid Attendance: 24,915 Referee: Vital Loraux (Belgium) 16 September 1970 Lerkendal Stadion, Trondheim Attendance: 11,299 Referee: Reino Koskinen (Finland) 16 September 1970 Ullevi Stadion, Gothemburg Attendance: 2,718 Referee: William O'Neill (Northern Ireland) 16 September 1970 Qemal Stafa Stadium, Tirana Attendance: 17,516 Referee: Paul Schiller (Austria) 16 September 1970 Central Stadium Vladimir Lenin, Moscow Attendance: 85,000 Referee: Jim Finney (England) 16 September 1970 The Oval, Belfast Attendance: 8,000 Referee: Johan Einar Boström (Sweden) 16 September 1970 Celtic Park, Glasgow Attendance: 39,744 Referee: Einar Hjaltarson (Iceland) 16 September 1970 Fenerbahçe Stadyumu, Istanbul Attendance: 31,833 Referee: Karol Šárka (Czechoslovakia) 16 September 1970 Estádio José Alvalade, Lisbon Attendance: 18,628 Referee: Joseph Hannet (Belgium) 16 September 1970 Megyeri úti Stadion, Budapest Attendance: 9,358 Referee: Todor Betchirov (Bulgaria) 16 September 1970 De Kuip, Rotterdam Attendance: 57,796 Referee: Gaspar Pintado Viu (Spain) 16 September 1970 Rosenaustadion, Augsburg Attendance: 15,764 Referee: Josef Krňávek (Czechoslovakia) 16 September 1970 Goodison Park, Liverpool Attendance: 28,424 Referee: Michalakis Kyriakides (Cyprus) 16 September 1970 Stade de la Frontière, Esch-sur-Alzette Attendance: 2,052 Referee: Roger Machin (France) 16 September 1970 Tehelné Pole, Bratislava Attendance: 8,213 Referee: Marian Srodecki (Poland) 30 September 1970 Stade Geoffroy Guichard, Saint-Étienne Attendance: 26,642 Referee: Gerhard Schulenburg (West Germany) Cagliari won 3–1 on aggregate. 30 September 1970 Praterstadion, Wien Attendance: 23,500 Referee: Michel Kitabdjian (France) Atlético Madrid won 4–1 on aggregate. 30 September 1970 Sclessin, Liège Attendance: 10,472 Referee: Gunnar Michaelsen (Denmark) Standard Liège won 7–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1970 Stadion Wojska Polskiego, Warsaw Attendance: 7,725 Referee: Léonidas Vamvakopoulos (Greece) Legia Warsaw won 6–1 on aggregate. 30 September 1970 Olympisch Stadion, Amsterdam Attendance: 28,978 Referee: Christos Michas (Greece) Ajax won 4–2 on aggregate. 30 September 1970 St. Jakob Stadium, Basel Attendance: 50,000 Referee: Ferdinand Marschall (Austria) 4–4 on aggregate;
