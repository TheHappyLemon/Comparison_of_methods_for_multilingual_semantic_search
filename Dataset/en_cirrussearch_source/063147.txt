Borden Island is an uninhabited, low-lying island in the Queen Elizabeth Islands of northern Canada. Split between Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, it is the northernmost point of the latter. With an area of 2,795 km2 (1,079 sq mi) in size, 93.9 kilometres (58.3 mi) long and 82 kilometres (51 mi) wide, Borden is the 171st largest island in the world, and Canada's 30th largest island. It lies north of Mackenzie King Island and is similarly split between the Northwest Territories (larger portion) and Nunavut, with the border running along the 110th meridian west. The first known sighting of the island was by Vilhjalmur Stefansson in 1916, it was originally described as a single landmass. However, in 1947, during an aerial survey by the Royal Canadian Air Force the island was found to be two islands divided by Wilkins Strait.
