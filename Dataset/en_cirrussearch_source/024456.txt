Andrew Talansky (born November 23, 1988) is an American triathlete. Between 2011 and 2017, he competed for Garmin–Cervélo on the UCI World Tour, cycling's highest road racing category. Born in Manhattan, New York City, New York, Talansky was raised in Key Biscayne, Florida, an island near Miami, Florida. He resides in Girona, Catalonia, Spain, and in Napa, California. Talansky competed in cross-country running at high school in Florida before taking up competitive cycling at age 17. After success in local amateur races, he moved to Lees–McRae College in Banner Elk, North Carolina, winning the collegiate national championship race in his freshman year. He left college after one year to join the Amore & Vita–McDonald's team in Italy in 2009, but found the conditions unsatisfactory and returned to the US that spring. He raced in the US in 2009 without team support. After a strong ride at the Tour of the Gila race, he joined Garmin for the 2010 season, moving up to the professional team for 2011, where he made the top ten at the 2011 Tour de Romandie. In 2012, Talansky scored his first professional victory in Europe at the Tour de l'Ain, and again rode the Tour de Romandie. This time he finished second overall behind Bradley Wiggins, having finished second to Wiggins on the final stage, a 16.24-kilometre (10.09-mile) individual time trial. Later in the season he was named Garmin's lead rider for the Vuelta a España, finishing seventh in the general classification. In 2013, he came second in Paris–Nice, having led the race for two days, and was selected for the Tour de France for the first time, again making the top ten overall. He won the 2014 Critérium du Dauphiné, joining a high-quality breakaway group on the final stage to overcome a 39-second deficit to overnight race leader Alberto Contador. He retired from the 2014 Tour de France after a very uncomfortable day on his bike, due to multiple crashes. The broom wagon was following him at the end of the stage. He returned to the Tour de France in 2015, finishing eleventh overall. The following year he once again contested the Tour de Romandie, but rode in support of Rigoberto Urán and Pierre Rolland. Later in the season, he took fifth-place overall finishes at the Tour de Suisse and the Vuelta a España. In September 2017 Talansky announced his retirement from competition via an Instagram post. However, the following month he indicated that he had "un-retired" and would take up competing in triathlon. 2008 1st Road race, National Collegiate Road Championships 2010 1st Time trial, National Under-23 Road Championships 1st Stage 2 Tour des Pays de Savoie 2nd Overall Tour de l'Avenir 3rd Overall Ronde de l'Isard 6th Overall Tour of the Gila 10th Overall Giro della Valle d'Aosta 2011 4th Overall Tour Méditerranéen 9th Overall Tour de Romandie 1st Young rider classification 2012 1st Overall Tour de l'Ain 1st Points classification 1st Stage 4 2nd Overall Tour de Romandie 1st Young rider classification 7th Overall Vuelta a España 8th Overall Volta ao Algarve 2013 2nd Overall Paris–Nice 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 3 6th Overall Critérium International 10th Overall Tour de France 2014 1st Overall Critérium du Dauphiné 7th Overall Volta a Catalunya 2015 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 10th Overall Critérium du Dauphiné 2016 3rd Overall Tour of Utah 1st Stage 6 4th Overall Tour of California 5th Overall Vuelta a España 5th Overall Tour de Suisse 2017 3rd Overall Tour of California 1st Stage 5 "Team Garmin-Sharp-Barracuda Unveils 2013 Roster".
