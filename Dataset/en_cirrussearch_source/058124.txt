Dominik Szoboszlai (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈdominik ˈsoboslɒi] SOB-oss-lah-ee; born 25 October 2000) is a Hungarian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Liverpool and captains the Hungary national team. A versatile player, he is able to play as a box-to-box midfielder, right midfielder or attacking midfielder. Coming through the youth system, Szoboszlai made his senior debut in 2017 with Austrian club FC Liefering, the reserve team of Red Bull Salzburg. In January 2018, Szoboszlai debuted with the parent club, becoming a starter from the 2018–19 season. Following three seasons, where he helped his club win three league titles and two domestic cups, in January 2021, Szoboszlai moved to Germany at RB Leipzig, a club associated with Red Bull Salzburg, for a reported fee of €20 million, making him the most expensive Hungarian footballer of all time. In his three seasons at the club he helped his side win two DFB-Pokal titles. In July 2023, he joined Liverpool after they paid his release clause of €70 million, making him the club's fourth-most expensive signing of all time. Szoboszlai represented Hungary internationally, both at youth and senior levels. He made his senior debut at the Euro 2020 qualifiers, helping his country qualify to the finals by scoring in the last minute in the play-offs against Iceland. Szoboszlai made his professional debut in the 2017–18 campaign, playing for the FC Liefering in the second division against Kapfenberg on 21 July 2017. He scored his first professional goal against FC Blau-Weiß Linz on 4 August 2017. During the 2017–18 season, he made his debut against Austria Wien on 27 May 2018.

He scored his first league goal against Wacker Innsbruck on 17 March 2019. On 17 September 2019, he made his Champions League debut and scored his first goal in this competition against Genk in a 6–2 victory. He scored a hat-trick as Salzburg won 5–1 against Sturm Graz on 10 June 2020. He finished the season with 9 goals and 14 assists in 27 league matches, and was voted player of the season for 2019–20 in Austrian football's top tier, the Bundesliga. On 17 December 2020, RB Leipzig announced the signing of Szoboszlai on a four-and-a-half-year contract, until June 2025. He became eligible to play in January 2021. With a reported price of €20 million, Szoboszlai became the most expensive Hungarian player in history. However, Szoboszlai could not feature in any match for RB Leipzig in the 2020–21 season due to a long-term injury. In the 2021–22 Bundesliga season, he made 31 appearances and scored 6 goals. He debuted on 7 August 2021 in a German Cup game against SV Sandhausen where he entered the pitch in the 78th minute and scored three minutes later.

On 3 June, he scored the second goal in a 2–0 win against Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal final at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. On 2 July 2023, Liverpool signed Szoboszlai on a five-year contract after triggering his release clause which was reportedly worth £60 million. He is the third Hungarian player to play for the club. On 13 August, Szoboszlai made his debut for Liverpool in their opening game of the 2023–24 season as his side drew to Chelsea with a score line of 1–1. On 19 August, Szoboszlai made his competitive debut at Anfield, in a 3–1 victory against Bournemouth. He was widely praised for his performance and Liverpool fans voted to award him the Player of the Match award. On 3 September 2023, Szoboszlai scored his first goal for Liverpool in a 3–0 Premier League win against Aston Villa, using his weak foot to strike from outside the box in the 3rd minute. He also became the first Hungarian to score for Liverpool. On 19 September 2023, he was named Standard Chartered Men's Player of the Month. By October 2023, Szoboszlai had created the most chances for Liverpool in the Premier League in the 2023–24 season, with 21. This was the highest number of chances created by a Liverpool player in their first nine Premier League appearances for the club since 2003. On 1 January 2024, he suffered a hamstring injury in a Premier League match against Newcastle United. He returned from his injury in a 5–2 victory in a 2023–24 FA Cup match against Norwich City. However, on 7 February 2024, it was revealed that he returned from his injury too early; therefore, he had to miss several matches in February. On 2 March 2024, he returned from his injury in a 1–0 victory over Nottingham Forest. Szoboszlai was the captain of Hungary U17 team during the 2017 UEFA European Under-17 Championship in Croatia, he scored two goals and his team finished 6th in this tournament. He also was the captain of Hungary U19 team during the 2019 UEFA European Under-19 Championship campaign. He made his debut for U-21 team against Germany U21 on 1 September 2017. He received his first call up to the senior Hungary squad for the friendly match against Russia and 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification against Andorra in June 2017. He made his debut for the senior squad on 21 March 2019 in a Euro 2020 qualifier against Slovakia as a 54th-minute substitute for László Kleinheisler. He scored his first international goal against the same opponent, Slovakia, in the same UEFA Euro 2020 run in a free kick at home. He scored in yet another free kick in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League B against Turkey, where Hungary emerged victoriously 1–0 away against Turkey in Sivas. In the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs game against Iceland, he scored a last minute winner to send Hungary into Euro 2020. Despite being initially selected to play in the latter, Szoboszlai withdrew injured on 1 June 2021. On 4 June 2022, Szoboszlai scored a penalty in a 1–0 win over England in the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League A, which was Hungary's first win against England since 31 May 1962, during the 1962 FIFA World Cup. After the resignation of Ádám Szalai and long-term injury of Péter Gulácsi, the team mates of the national team and Marco Rossi appointed Szoboszlai as the new captain of the national team. Right after the friendly match against Luxembourg, Rossi said in an interview with M4 that Szoboszlai could become a top player soon, which is why he was elected captain. On 27 March 2023, he scored his first goal as a captain against Bulgaria in a 3–0 victory for Hungary in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying at the Puskás Aréna. On 19 November 2023, he scored twice in a 3–1 victory over Montenegro in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying match at the Puskás Aréna. On 22 March 2024, he scored the winning goal against Turkey at the Puskás Aréna in a friendly match. Four days later, he also scored in a 2–0 victory over Kosovo. He is described as a Box to box midfielder. According to Bundesliga expert Raphael Honigstein, "he's a very technical player, very easy on the eye, quite tall as well, so he looks imposing". In an interview published on Nemzeti Sport, his manager, Mátyás Esterházy, said that Szoboszlai is a versatile footballer since he plays different positions in Liverpool and the national team. While he has a defined role in Liverpool, Marco Rossi gives more freedom to him in the national team. When asked if Szoboszlai is talented, Esterházy said that anyone can achieve the level Dominik has achieved with the time and energy Dominik invested in his career. Szoboszlai is often referred to as Hungary's leading footballer. He has frequently been compared to compatriot Ferenc Puskás, with Hungarian football pundit Abel Meszaros saying: "Szoboszlai is ahead of everyone since Lajos Détári. You have to really go back far… He is approaching the realm of Puskas and others in that class." Szoboszlai was listed as the 52nd best player of the world in 2023 by The Guardian. Szoboszlai was born in Székesfehérvár to Zsanett (née Németh) and former footballer Zsolt Szoboszlai, who played in the lower leagues of Austria. When Dominik was born, his mother was only 21 years old, while his father was 25 years old. His father started training him from the age of three by positioning plastic bottles on the ground to slalom with the ball. In an interview with Nemzeti Sport, Bendegúz Bolla said that Szoboszlai's father often made Dominik practice with golf balls in his childhood. In 2022, he donated to the charity Cseppkő Gyermekotthoni Központ along with Ádám Szalai. In 2023, he donated a shirt to the foundation that helped to raise money for the family of late Csaba Ponczok, former player of Maglódi TC, who died in 2022. In addition to his native Hungarian, Szoboszlai also speaks fluent English and German. In an interview with Fodball, he said that he often feels lonely. In the first couple of days, he had a hard time in Liverpool. However, later he became friends with Trent Alexander-Arnold.
