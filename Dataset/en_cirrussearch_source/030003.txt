Ion Izagirre Insausti (born 4 February 1989) is a Spanish professional road bicycle racer and cyclo-cross rider from the Basque Country, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Cofidis. He is sometimes referred to as Jon Izaguirre, to retain the correct pronunciation under Castilian orthography. Born in Ormaiztegi in the Basque Country, Izagirre comes from a family of professional cyclists, as both his father José Ramón and brother Gorka have competed professionally on the roads and in cyclo-cross. Having joined the Euskaltel–Euskadi team – alongside brother Gorka – from the 2011 season onwards, Izagirre won his first professional races in the spring of 2012; he won the individual time trial at the Vuelta a Asturias in April, before taking a victory during his Grand Tour début at the Giro d'Italia. During the sixteenth stage, Izagirre made a solo breakaway with 4 km (2.5 mi) remaining, before winning the stage by sixteen seconds from his nearest competitor. Following the collapse of the Euskaltel–Euskadi team at the end of the 2013 season, both Izagirre brothers were signed by the Movistar Team for the 2014 season. In 2015, Izagirre won the Tour de Pologne. He started the final stage sixth on general classification but overhauled race leader Sergio Henao (Team Sky) and the others above him by virtue of a superior time trial performance on the rolling 25-kilometre (16-mile) circuit. Izagirre won Stage 20 of the 2016 Tour de France in Morzine, after attacking on the wet descent from a three rider group that led over the final climb of Col de Joux Plane. Izagirre moved to the newly formed Bahrain–Merida team for the 2017 season. He was the team's GC leader at the Tour de France, but crashed out on Stage 1, an individual time trial in Düsseldorf, suffering a lumbar fracture which ended his season. He was joined at Bahrain–Merida by his brother Gorka for the 2018 season. In August 2018 it was announced that the brothers would join Astana in 2019. In September 2021, Izagirre signed a one-year contract to ride for Cofidis in 2022. 2006 3rd Junior race, National Cyclo-cross Championships 2008 1st Gipuzkoa Individual Time Trial 3rd Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships 2009 1st Under-23 race, Basque Cyclo-cross Championships 1st Memorial Angel Mantecon 1st Stage 4 Bizkaiko Bira 5th Overall Bidasoa Itzulia 2011 4th Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia 2012 (2 pro wins) 1st Stage 16 Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 2b (ITT) Vuelta a Asturias 3rd Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche 7th Overall Tour de Pologne 2013 National Road Championships 2nd Road race 4th Time trial 2nd Overall Tour de Pologne 4th Overall Tour Down Under 9th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal 2014 (1) National Road Championships 1st Road race 2nd Time trial 2nd Overall Tour de Pologne 4th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 6th Overall Tour of Britain 8th Overall Tour de Romandie 2015 (1) 1st Overall Tour de Pologne 2nd GP Miguel Induráin 2nd Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia 3rd Team time trial, UCI Road World Championships 3rd Overall Tour of the Basque Country 10th Overall Volta ao Algarve 2016 (5) 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st GP Miguel Induráin 1st Stage 20 Tour de France 2nd Overall Volta ao Algarve 2nd Overall Tour de Suisse 1st Stage 8 (ITT) 3rd Overall Tour de Romandie 1st Prologue 4th Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 5th Overall Paris–Nice 8th Time trial, Olympic Games 8th Overall Eneco Tour 8th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal 2017 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 3rd Overall Tour of the Basque Country 5th Overall Tour de Romandie 5th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 6th Overall Tour de Suisse 6th Vuelta a Murcia 7th Overall Paris–Nice 7th Amstel Gold Race 2018 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships 3rd Overall Tour of the Basque Country 4th Overall Paris–Nice 6th Giro di Lombardia 7th Clásica de San Sebastián 9th Overall Vuelta a España 2019 (3) 1st Overall Tour of the Basque Country 1st Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 1st Stage 8 Paris–Nice 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Vuelta a España 2nd Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 2020 (1) 1st Stage 6 Vuelta a España 4th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 7th Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 2021 (2) 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 3rd Overall Paris–Nice 7th Overall Critérium du Dauphiné 7th Overall Tour de Romandie 10th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 1st Stage 4 2022 (1) 2nd Overall Tour of the Basque Country 1st Stage 6 5th Time trial, National Road Championships 6th Overall O Gran Camiño 6th Overall Tour Poitou-Charentes en Nouvelle-Aquitaine 7th Overall Paris–Nice 7th GP Miguel Induráin 2023 (2) 1st GP Miguel Induráin 1st Stage 12 Tour de France 3rd Overall Tour of the Basque Country 5th Clásica de San Sebastián 7th Circuito de Getxo 8th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal 8th Tre Valli Varesine 10th Coppa Bernocchi 2024 4th GP Miguel Induráin "Euskaltel to be led by Izaguirre brothers and Astarloza in Santos Tour Down Under".
