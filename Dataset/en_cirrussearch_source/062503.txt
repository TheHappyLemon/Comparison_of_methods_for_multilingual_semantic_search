Willy Sulzbacher (7 August 1876 – 15 August 1908) was a French fencer. He competed in the men's épée event at the 1900 Summer Olympics. Some sources, including the IOC athlete database, list him as a German competitor because he was named to the Games by Deutscher und Österreichischer Fechterbund, a German fencing club. He committed suicide by shooting himself in 1908. "Willy Sulzbacher". Olympedia. Retrieved 19 July 2020. "Willy Sulzbacher". Olympic.org. Retrieved 21 July 2020. Willy Sulzbacher at Olympedia v t e
