He represented Uzbekistan in the men's road race at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. In 2005, he captured the Uzbekistan national road race and time trial championships. In June 2006, he rode for the Navigators Insurance team and has captured the Commerce Bank Triple series championship in the US, as well as regaining his national road race title. In November 2013, Lagutin announced that he had signed for the RusVelo team for the 2014 season, and also that he would ride under a Russian licence rather than for Uzbekistan.
