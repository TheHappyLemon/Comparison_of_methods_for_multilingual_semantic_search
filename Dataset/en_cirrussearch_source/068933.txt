The 2023–24 Premier League is the ongoing 32nd season of the Premier League and the 125th season of top-flight English football overall. The fixtures were announced on 15 June 2023 at 09:00 BST. The season began on 11 August 2023, and is set to conclude on 19 May 2024. Manchester City are the three-time defending champions and can become the first men's club in the history of the English top flight to win four titles in a row, if successful. This season is the third to feature a winter break, with every team having a two-week break from all competitions sometime between 2 January and 30 January 2024. The summer transfer window lasted between 14 June and 1 September 2023. The Premier League's winter transfer window was opened between 1 January and 1 February 2024. For only the third time in Premier League history (after Middlesbrough in 1996–97 and Portsmouth in 2009–10), a Premier League team were deducted points; on 17 November 2023, Everton had 10 points deducted from their total for a breach of the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules. The deduction was the biggest to be handed out in Premier League history and was subject to appeal. On 26 February 2024 following their appeal, it was announced that the deduction had been reduced to six points. On 30 September 2023, in the game between Tottenham and Liverpool, Premier League's video assistant referee (VAR), Darren England, failed to intervene on a decision that disallowed Luis Díaz's legitimate goal. Liverpool lost the game 2–1 and PGMOL admitted the offside ruling as a "significant human error". It was revealed that England and the assistant VAR, Dan Cook, took an eight-hour long flight back from the UAE a day before. A group of PGMOL officials were in UAE to take charge of a match between Sharjah and Al-Ain. It led to questions over PGMOL's decision of allowing the leading match officials to take lucrative assignments in the UAE Pro League although the Emirates owns the Premier League club, Manchester City. On 5 December 2023, Sheffield United became the first club to sack their manager, dismissing Paul Heckingbottom after their 5–0 defeat to fellow newly-promoted side Burnley. He was replaced by Chris Wilder, marking his return to the club since the 2020–21 season. At that time, Sheffield United were bottom of the league, having amassed only five points in 14 games. On 16 December 2023, the match between Bournemouth and Luton Town was abandoned after 65 minutes with the score level at 1–1 as Luton captain Tom Lockyer suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed on the pitch. Play was initially suspended, with the referee taking both sets of players off, midway through the second half, whilst medical personnel tended to Lockyer. He was eventually stretchered off, and taken to hospital, where it was later announced that he was responsive, and in a stable condition. The game was replayed on 13 March 2024, with Luton taking a 3–0 lead at half-time, before Bournemouth fought back in the second half to win 4–3, in what was praised as one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the league. On 19 December 2023, Nottingham Forest became the second club to sack their manager, dismissing Steve Cooper after Forest had won one game from 13 league games played. His last game in charge was a 2–0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. He was replaced by former Wolverhampton Wanderers and Spurs coach Nuno Espírito Santo, whose first game in charge was a 3–2 home loss to Bournemouth, extending the club’s winless run to seven games. In his second game, Nuno ended Nottingham Forest's winless run with a 3–1 away win at Newcastle United, with Chris Wood scoring a hat-trick against his old club, having left in the January transfer window of the 2022–23 season. On 26 January 2024, Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp announced his intention to step down as manager at the end of the season after more than eight years in charge. On 19 February 2024, Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson resigned from his role. Palace had lost ten of their previous 16 games and were 16th in the table, five points above the relegation zone. Hodgson, who had been taken ill at a team training session on 15 February, was replaced by former Frankfurt manager Oliver Glasner. On 18 March 2024, Nottingham Forest became the fourth ever Premier League club to receive a points deduction, as they were deducted four points for a breach of the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. The decision is currently under appeal. The new stoppage time rule takes place in the league this year. In an effort to improve clamping down on time-wasting and to improve the accuracy of time added on, stoppage times will be longer across matches. The new rule will account for stoppages due to injuries, goal celebrations, yellow and red cards, and VAR reviews. Additionally, there will be yellow/red card offences for dissent and time wasting, which contributed to a massive increase in yellow and red cards this season. Twenty teams are competing in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams are Burnley, Sheffield United, and Luton Town, who returned to the top flight after respective absences of one, two and thirty-one years. This is also Luton Town's first season in the Premier League. With their promotion, Luton Town were the first team to have been promoted from non-League (5th tier or lower within the English football league pyramid) to the top flight during the Premier League era. The promoted teams replaced Leicester City, Leeds United, and Southampton, who were relegated to the Championship after respective spells of nine, three and eleven years in the top flight.

As winners of the 2023–24 EFL Cup, Liverpool qualify for the Conference League play-off round. If they qualify for the Champions League or Europa League via league position, the Conference League spot will be passed to the highest-placed team that does not qualify for European competitions. Everton were deducted six points for breaching profitability and sustainability rules. They were originally deducted 10 points but this was reduced after an appeal. Nottingham Forest were deducted four points for breaching profitability and sustainability rules. The decision is currently under appeal. Updated to match(es) played on 31 March 2024.
