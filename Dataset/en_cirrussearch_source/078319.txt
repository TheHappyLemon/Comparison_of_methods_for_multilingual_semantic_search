Latvian Human Rights Committee (Latvian: Latvijas Cilvēktiesību komiteja, Russian: Латвийский комитет по правам человека) is a non-governmental human rights organization in Latvia. It is a member of international human rights and anti-racism NGOs FIDH, AEDH. Co-chairpersons of LHRC are Vladimir Buzayev and Natalia Yolkina [lv]. According to the authors of the study "Ethnopolitics in Latvia", former CBSS Commissioner on Democratic Institutions and Human Rights Ole Espersen "had visited LHRC various times and had used mostly the data of that organisation in his views on Latvia". In 1992, LHRC was founded (as the Latvian Human Rights and International Humanitarian Co-operation Committee) by a group of people co-operating since 1990, led by Tatjana Ždanoka and Vladimir Bogdanov. In 1995, LHRC joined FIDH and was registered by Latvian authorities. Since 1994, LHRC periodically publishes an updated list of differences in rights between citizens and non-citizens of Latvia. Since 1997, LHRC supports UNITED for Intercultural Action. In 2007, LHRC has joined ENAR and AEDH.
