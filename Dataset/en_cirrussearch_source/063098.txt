The 2022‚Äì23 Ligue 1, also known as Ligue 1 Uber Eats for sponsorship reasons, was the 85th season of the Ligue 1, France's premier football competition. It began on 5 August 2022 and concluded on 3 June 2023. As the 2022 FIFA World Cup began on 20 November, the last round before the break was held on 12‚Äì13 November. The league subsequently resumed on 27 December. Four clubs were relegated to Ligue 2 at the end of the season as the number of clubs was reduced to 18 starting from the 2023‚Äì24 season. As a result, no play-offs were held at the end of the season, and this was the last season played with 20 teams. Paris Saint-Germain were the defending champions, and they won a record-breaking eleventh title with one match to spare, following a 1‚Äì1 draw against Strasbourg on 27 May. Lens returned to the Champions League group stage for the first time since the 2002‚Äì03. Reims went on a record-breaking 19-game unbeaten run under Will Still. Paris Saint-Germain were the defending champions, and secured a record-breaking eleventh title following a 1‚Äì1 draw at Strasbourg on the penultimate matchday. A total of twenty teams participated in the 2022‚Äì23 edition of the Ligue 1. Toulouse (promoted to Ligue 1 after a two-year absence), Ajaccio (promoted after an eight-year absence), and Auxerre (promoted after a ten-year absence) were promoted from the 2021‚Äì22 Ligue 2. Bordeaux (relegated after thirty years in the top flight), Metz (relegated after three years in the top flight), and Saint-√âtienne (relegated after eighteen years in the top flight) were relegated to 2022‚Äì23 Ligue 2.
