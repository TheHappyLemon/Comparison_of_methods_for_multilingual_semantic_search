Pustoshkinsky District (Russian: Пусто́шкинский райо́н) is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the twenty-four in Pskov Oblast, Russia. It is located in the south of the oblast and borders with Bezhanitsky District in the north, Novosokolnichesky District in the east, Nevelsky District in the south, Sebezhsky District in the west, and with Opochetsky District in the northwest. The area of the district is 1,870 square kilometers (720 sq mi). Its administrative center is the town of Pustoshka. Population: 9,379 (2010 Census); 12,071 (2002 Census); 14,063 (1989 Census). The population of Pustoshka accounts for 49.2% of the district's total population. A major part of the district lies in the basin of the Velikaya River. The Velikaya flows through the district, making a bow in its northern part. The largest tributary of the Velikaya inside the district is the Alolya (right). The rivers in the south of the district drain into the Nevedryanka, a right tributary of the Daugava, and into the Ushcha, also in the Daugava basin. The landscape of the district is a hilly plain of glacial origin, which contains many lakes. The biggest lakes in the district are Nevedro, Asho, Orleya, Veryato, and Losno. The Velikaya River served as one of the branches of the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, and the area was settled at least from the medieval times. It was dependent on Pskov and in the beginning on the 15th century it was conquered by Lithuanians. Afterwards, it was on the border between Russia (Grand Duchy of Moscow) and Poland, changing hands. The seat of the area was Zavolochye. In 1582, the area was transferred to Russia. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off, and in 1772, Pskov Governorate (which between 1777 and 1796 existed as Pskov Viceroyalty) was established. In 1777, Novorzhev was founded and Zavolochye was abolished. The area was split between several uyezds of Pskov Governorate. Pustoshka was founded in 1901 as a railway station during the construction of the railway between Moscow and Riga. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Pustoshkinsky District was established, with the administrative center in Pustoshka. It included parts of former Sebezhsky, Nevelsky, and Opochetsky Uyezds. The governorates were abolished as well, and the district became a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On June 17, 1929, the district was transferred to Western Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935, the district was transferred to Kalinin Oblast, and on February 5 of the same year, Pustoshkinsky District became a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Kalinin Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. On May 4, 1938, the district was transferred to Opochka Okrug. On February 5, 1941, the okrug was abolished. Between 1941 and 1944, Pustoshkinsky District was occupied by German troops. On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished and Pustoshkinsky District was transferred to Pskov Oblast. The district was abolished on February 1, 1963, and re-established on January 12, 1965. On August 1, 1927, Kudeversky District with the administrative center in the selo of Kudever was also established. It included parts of former Novorzhevsky Uyezd. The district was a part of Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On September 20, 1931, Kudeversky District was abolished and merged into Novorzhevsky District.

On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished, and Kudeversky District was transferred to Pskov Oblast. On January 14, 1958, Kudeversky District was abolished and split between Bezhanitsky, Novorzhevsky, Opochetsky, and Pustoshkinsky Districts. Another district created on August 1, 1927 was Rykovsky District with the administrative center in the selo of Skokovo. It included parts of former Velikoluksky and Opochetsky Uyezds.
