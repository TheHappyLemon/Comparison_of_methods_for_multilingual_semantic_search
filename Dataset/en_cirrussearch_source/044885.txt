Vladislav Andreyevich Gavrikov (Russian: Владислав Андреевич Гавриков; born 21 November 1995) is a Russian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted 159th overall by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Gavrikov made his Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) debut with Lokomotiv Yaroslavl during the 2014–15 season. With his development steadily progressing during his four senior years with Lokomotiv, his KHL rights were traded to powerhouse club SKA Saint Petersburg following the 2016–17 season. With the Columbus Blue Jackets hopeful of signing the Russian, he was earlier offered a contract and invited by the Blue Jackets to a tour of Columbus, Ohio. Despite his arrival on 27 June 2017, Gavrikov told the Blue Jackets that he had agreed to a two-year contract to remain in Russia with SKA. In the 2018–19 season, Gavrikov scored a career-high 20 points in 60 games with SKA. Following a second consecutive conference final defeat to CSKA Moscow, Gavrikov was released from his expiring contract to sign a two-year, entry-level contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets on 13 April 2019. Gavrikov scored his first career NHL goal on 15 November 2019. The goal was scored on goaltender Jake Allen and the St. Louis Blues. Gavrikov finished his rookie regular season with 18 points in 69 games. Gavrikov would score his first career NHL playoff goal during the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Toronto Maple Leafs. He would finish the playoffs with three points in 10 games. On 5 November 2020, Gavrikov signed a three-year, $8.4 million contract extension with the Blue Jackets. On 1 March 2023, he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings along with Joonas Korpisalo for goaltender Jonathan Quick and two draft picks. He scored his first goal as a King on 6 March 2023 against the Washington Capitals.[citation needed] On 7 June 2023, Gavrikov opted to forgo free agency and was signed a two-year contract extension to remain with the Kings with an annual value of $5.875 million. Gavrikov has represented Russia in international play at the World Under-17 Challenge, World Under-18 Championships, World Junior Championships, Senior World Championships and Olympic Games.
