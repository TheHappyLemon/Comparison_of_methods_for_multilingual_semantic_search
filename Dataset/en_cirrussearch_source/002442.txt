.jm is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Jamaica. Registrations are at the third level beneath the second level names com.jm, net.jm, org.jm, edu.jm, gov.jm, and mil.jm. Registrations are processed by hand rather than automatically, so registrants are asked to allow 30 days for the registrations to be completed. Updates to domain names (such as changes to nameservers) can only be authorized by the technical or registrant e-mail addresses. Registration of .jm domains is handled by Mona Information Technology Services (MITS) at the University of the West Indies. Registration is free, although there has been some discussion about MITS making the service commercial in the coming years. Internet in Jamaica "E-mail concerning registration of edu.jm subdomains".
