At its Salacgriva location, the festival took place only 12 km from the Estonian-Latvian border and therefore saw a strong attendance of Estonian visitors, musicians, caterers, and marketers as well as festival personnel, rendering Positivus an unofficial yearly meeting of the two neighbour countries. Estonians called it "Estonia's biggest music festival in Latvia". From 2007 through 2019, Positivus was held in the Latvian coastal town of Salacgrīva located between the A1 Via Baltica highway and the beach of the Riga Bay. The festival offered access to meadows, forests, the beach, as well as the local town of Salacgrīva. From 2007 through 2019, the festival camping site was located on the other side of the A1 Via Baltica road, directly across from the festival venue, and it was sponsored by Merrild Coffee, which provided complementary coffee refills for campers during the entire festival. The camping grounds also had catering services. The car parking was located within a short distance from the camping site. As of 2016, there has been a separated area for caravans and trailer houses.
