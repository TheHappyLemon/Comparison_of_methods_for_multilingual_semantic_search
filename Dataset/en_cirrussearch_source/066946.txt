Ethan Bear (born June 26, 1997) is a Cree-Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman for the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted in the fifth round, 124th overall, by the Edmonton Oilers in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. He was drafted in the fifth round in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft by the Edmonton Oilers from the Seattle Thunderbirds in the Western Hockey League (WHL). He was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Oilers on July 2, 2016. Bear made his NHL debut on March 1, 2018, in a game against the Nashville Predators. He recorded his first NHL goal in a 5–4 overtime loss to the Anaheim Ducks on March 25, 2018. Bear was the first player to wear a jersey with his name written in Cree syllabics (ᒪᐢᑲᐧ, Maskwa) during an exhibition match against the Calgary Flames on July 28, 2020. On December 28, 2020, Bear signed a two-year, $4 million contract extension with the Oilers. After his fourth year within the Oilers organization, Bear was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Warren Foegele on July 28, 2021. In the following 2021–22 season, Bear tied a career high with five goals and added nine assists for 14 points through 58 regular season games. Struggling to fully adjust to the Hurricanes system, Bear was a healthy scratch through two rounds of the playoffs. As a restricted free agent in the off-season, Bear was re-signed by the Hurricanes to a one-year, $2.2 million contract on July 28, 2022. Beginning the 2022–23 season as a healthy scratch, Bear was traded by the Hurricanes alongside Lane Pederson to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for a fifth-round pick in 2023. On December 28, 2023, Bear signed a two-year contract with the Washington Capitals worth $4.125 million. He made his debut with the Capitals on December 30, 2023 against the Nashville Predators. On May 5, 2023, Bear was named to Canada men's national ice hockey team at the 2023 IIHF World Championship, where he was scoreless in eight games. He won a gold medal, although a slash from Kasperi Kapanen at the end of the quarterfinal against Finland forced him to miss his team's final two games. Bear was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, and raised on the Ochapowace Nation near Whitewood, Saskatchewan. His older brother, Everett, also played hockey. He is of Cree descent. He faced racism from hockey fans relying on stereotypes for being a "lazy" player while growing up, which motivated him to work harder as he drew inspiration from his brother and other Indigenous hockey players, including Carey Price, Jordin Tootoo, Brandon Montour, Arron Asham, and Micheal Ferland. In the summer, he gives back by running a youth hockey camp in Ochapowace. In January 2023, Ethan and fiance, Lenasia Ned welcomed a baby girl, Gracie Bambi Bear. On July 29 of that same year, Ethan and Lenasia were married in Kelowna, B.C. Klinkenberg, Marty (March 1, 2018).
