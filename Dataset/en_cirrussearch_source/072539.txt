This is a list of International Olympic Committee (IOC) country codes. There are 206 current NOCs (National Olympic Committees) within the Olympic Movement. The following tables show the currently used code for each NOC and any different codes used in past Games, per the official reports from those Games. Some of the past code usage is further explained in the following sections. Codes used specifically for a Summer Games only or a Winter Games only, within the same year, are indicated by "S" and "W" respectively. Most National Paralympic Committees (NPC) cover a territory with an active NOC. In these cases the NPC codes matches the IOC codes shown above. The two current NPCs without a corresponding NOC use the following NPC codes. Fourteen historical NOCs or teams have codes that are still used in the IOC results database to refer to past medal winners from these teams. Unlike the previous list, these codes no longer appear in the IOC results database. When a past athlete from one of these teams has won a medal, the new code is shown next to them instead. Two other significant code changes have occurred, both because of a change in the nation's designation as used by the IOC: HOL was changed to NED for the Netherlands for the 1992 Games, reflecting the change in designation from Holland. IRN was changed to IRI for Iran for the 1992 Games, reflecting the change in designation to Islamic Republic of Iran. The World Games are a multi-sport event comprising sports and sporting disciplines that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The World Games are governed by the International World Games Association, under the patronage of the International Olympic Committee.
