The Sweden women's national football team (Swedish: Svenska damfotbollslandslaget), nicknamed Blågult ("The Blue-Yellow"), represents Sweden at international women's association football competitions. It was established in 1973 and is governed by the Swedish Football Association. The team has represented Sweden at the FIFA Women's World Cup on nine occasions. They were runners-up in 2003 and bronze medalists in 1991, 2011, 2019, and 2023. Sweden have been to seven Olympic Games, winning silver medals in 2016 and 2021. On the continental level, the team has participated in the UEFA Women's Euro eleven times, becoming champions in 1984 and finishing in second place in 1987, 1995, and 2001. They have also competed in the UEFA Women's Nations League since the inaugural 2023–24 season. The 2003 World Cup final was only the second time Sweden ever reached the final of a FIFA World Cup after the 1958 FIFA Men's World Cup Final, and was the second most watched event in Sweden that year. The team was coached by Thomas Dennerby from 2005 to 2012. After winning the two qualifying matches against Denmark for the Beijing 2008 Olympics, the Swedish Olympic Committee approved of record increases in investments for the women's team. The new budget granted over a million SEK (about US$150,000) for the team and 150,000 SEK (about US$25,000) per player for developing physical fitness. The new grants are almost a 100% increase of the 2005 and 2006 season funds. The team was coached by Pia Sundhage from 2012 to 2017. The developments and conditions of the Sweden women's national football team from its beginnings until 2013 can be seen in the 2013 three-part Sveriges Television documentary television series The Other Sport. Lotta Schelin surpassed Hanna Ljungberg's 72-goal record against Germany on 29 October 2014. In November 2016, Peter Gerhardsson was announced as the new manager, and replaced Pia Sundhage after the UEFA Women's Euro 2017. At the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, the Swedish national team won all of their three group stage games against South Africa, Italy, and Argentina. The round of 16 knockout game against the United States finished 0–0 after extra time, with the Swedish team winning 5–4 in the penalty shootout. Sweden then won the quarter-final against Japan with two goals against one. In the semi-final, the eventual world champions Spain became too difficult to overcome and the game was decided in the 89th minute with a winning goal for Spain. Sweden went on to win the bronze medal for the fourth time, beating co-hosts Australia 2–0 in the third-place match. Central defender Amanda Ilestedt was named the third-best player of the tournament and received the bronze ball. She was also the highest scorer for Sweden with four tournament goals.
