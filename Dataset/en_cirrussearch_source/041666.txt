Cristian Gabriel Rodríguez Barotti (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkɾistjan roˈðɾiɣes]; born 30 September 1985) is a Uruguayan former footballer who played as a left winger. Having received the nickname Cebolla (onion) from his Peñarol days, from his father, he was well known for his speed and technical ability. He spent several seasons in Portugal with Benfica and Porto, and also competed professionally in France, Spain, Italy, Brazil and Argentina. Rodríguez earned 110 caps for Uruguay, representing the country in two World Cups and four Copa América tournaments and winning the 2011 edition of the latter. Born in Juan Lacaze, Rodríguez started playing professionally, still a youngster, for local Peñarol in the Uruguayan Primera División, where he helped the side to the 2003 title. After an injury ruled him out for some games in late 2004, he was spotted by television cameras jumping in the stands alongside the supporters, but he eventually escaped a fine or suspension. In 2005, Rodríguez was transferred to French club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. on a free transfer, along with Carlos Bueno. After appearing scarcely in his first season in Ligue 1, he was important in helping the capital team barely avoid relegation, scoring his only goal in a 4–2 home win against AS Monaco FC. In late August 2007, Rodríguez moved to Portugal's S.L. Benfica in a season-long loan, together with compatriot Maxi Pereira who arrived from Defensor Sporting. After being one of their most important players through 2007–08, he was bought by fellow Primeira Liga club FC Porto in June 2008 (but part of the transfer fee was paid to Play International B.V.). During the two teams' match in Lisbon, on 30 August 2008, he was subjected to vitriolic abuse from the stands in a 1–1 final draw. He eventually settled nonetheless, forming an attacking trio with Argentine Lisandro López and Brazilian Hulk and also scoring occasionally through unsuspecting headers. After Silvestre Varela was bought by Porto in the 2009 off-season, Rodríguez was relegated to a substitute role. He still made 32 competitive appearances in the 2010–11 campaign (two goals, including one in 11 matches in a victorious run in the UEFA Europa League). On 17 February 2014, Rodríguez was condemned to pay a €45,000 fine for assaulting two stewards at the Estádio da Luz, following a tunnel brawl during the 0–1 away league loss against Benfica on 20 December 2009. On 28 May 2012, Rodríguez signed a four-year contract with Atlético Madrid after being released by Porto. He scored his first two goals for his new team in the Europa League group stage, against Hapoel Tel Aviv FC (3–0 away victory) and FC Viktoria Plzeň (home); in the latter, he netted the game's only goal through a thunderous left-foot shot in the 93rd minute. On 20 January 2015, Rodríguez joined Parma F.C. until the end of the season. Less than two months later, however, due to the Italian club's precarious financial situation, he joined Brazil's Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense also on loan. Rodríguez left Grêmio on 8 May 2015, after struggling with injuries and totalling less than 80 minutes of action. On 24 July 2015, Rodríguez agreed to a two-year deal at Club Atlético Independiente as a free agent. After suffering from several injury problems, his contract was terminated on 19 December 2016. On 3 February 2017, Rodríguez announced his return to Peñarol. He went on to win the 2017 and 2018 national championships as well as the 2018 Supercopa Uruguaya, ending his second stint in April 2021 with 126 appearances and 39 goals in all competitions. Rodríguez joined Club Plaza Colonia de Deportes on 20 April 2021. On 17 January 2023, he announced his retirement at the age of 37. Rodríguez made his Uruguay national team debut at age 18 in a friendly against Mexico, and represented the nation in two Copa América tournaments, scoring in the 2007 edition in a 4–1 quarter-final win over Venezuela, the hosts. After assaulting Argentina's Gabriel Heinze during the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying stage (0–1 home loss) he received a four-match ban, and coach Oscar Tabárez opted to not select him for the final stages in South Africa. Rodríguez was included in the 2015 Copa América squad, scoring the only goal in the tournament opener against Jamaica in Antofagasta. The 32-year-old was also selected for the 2018 World Cup. As of match played 17 May 2021 Uruguay score listed first, score column indicates score after each Rodríguez goal.
