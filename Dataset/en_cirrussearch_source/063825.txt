Gylmar dos Santos Neves (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʒiwˈmaʁ duˈsɐ̃tuz ˈnɛvis]; 22 August 1930 – 25 August 2013), known simply as Gilmar, was a Brazilian footballer who played goalkeeper for Corinthians and Santos and was a member of the Brazil national team in three World Cups. He was elected the best Brazilian goalkeeper of the 20th century and one of the best in the world by the IFFHS. He is remembered for his sober style on the pitch and his peaceful personality. Alex Bellos says in his book Futebol: The Brazilian Way of Life that Gilmar is named after his parents, Gilberto and Maria. Gilmar was the starting goalkeeper for Pelé's Santos and Brazilian national teams of the 1960s. In 1998, he was awarded the FIFA Order of Merit. Gilmar was born in Santos, São Paulo, and started his career playing for hometown side Jabaquara. In 1951 he joined Corinthians, winning three Campeonato Paulista titles with the club in 1951, 1952 and 1954. In 1961, Gilmar signed for Santos, being a part of the team who was known as Os Santásticos. An immediate starter, he won five Campeonato Paulista (1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968), five Taça Brasil (1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965), two Copa Libertadores (1962 and 1963) and two Intercontinental Cups (1962 against Eusébio's Benfica and 1963 against Milan). Gilmar played 94 times with the Brazil national team. He was selected to the national squad for three straight World Cups, between 1958 and 1966. He was part of the starting team in the first two World Cups Brazil won, in 1958 and 1962, and is the only goalkeeper to win two consecutive World Cups in the starting position. Regarded by pundits as one of the greatest Brazilian goalkeepers of all time, Gilmar was an agile shot-stopper, who possessed excellent reflexes, and who was also known for his composure under pressure, as well as his ability to inspire a sense of calm and confidence in his defenders. Gilmar died of a stroke on 25 August 2013, three days after his 83rd birthday.
