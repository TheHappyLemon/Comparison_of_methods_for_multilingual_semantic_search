Corylus ferox, the Himalayan hazelnut or Tibetan hazelnut, is a species of hazel native to the Himalayas of eastern Asia. The Himalayan hazelnut is a deciduous tree growing to 32 m (105 ft) tall, with a monoecious leaf that can individually be male or female and some can be both sexes. The leaves are rounded or elliptic, 7–12 cm (2+3⁄4–4+3⁄4 in) long and 3–5 cm (1–2 in) broad, with a fine and sharply serrated margin and an often truncated apex. The flowers are wind-pollinated catkins and precocious. The male (pollen) catkins are pendulous with numerous solitary flowers and no perianth, while the female catkins are inconspicuous, 6-8 scaly buds and perianth adnate.
