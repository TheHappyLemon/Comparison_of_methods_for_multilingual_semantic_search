Yasuj (Persian: ياسوج, romanized: Yāsūj [jɒːˈsuːdʒ] ); also romanized as Yasooj, and Yesūj; Luri: یاسووج Jasuc or یاسیچ Jasyç) is a city in the Central District of Boyer-Ahmad County, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district. Yasuj is an industrial city in the Zagros Mountains of southwestern Iran. The term Yasuj is also used to refer to the entire region. Yasuj has a sugar processing plant. The area of Yasuj had been settled as early as the Bronze Age. Findings include the Martyrs Hills (dating from 3rd millennium BC), the Khosravi Hill from the Achaemenian period, the ancient site of Gerd, the Pataveh bridge, and the Pay-e Chol cemetery. Yasuj is the place where Alexander III of Macedon and his Macedonian forces stormed the Persian Gates (Darvazeh-ye Fars), and found a way into the Persian heartland (331 BC). The Yasuj Museum, which opened in 2002, displays coins, statues, pottery, and bronze vessels recovered from surrounding archaeological sites. On May 18, 2023, the city of Madavan and the villages of Balahzar, Jadval-e Ghureh-ye Mehrian, Madavan-e Sofla, Mehrian, Sarab-e Taveh, Servak, and Tall Khosrow merged with the city of Yasuj. Yasuj has the typical continental-influenced Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa) of western Iran, though because of its location in the direct line of rain-bearing winds from the Persian Gulf it is the wettest Iranian city south of the Alborz Mountains with an annual rainfall nine times that of Isfahan and twice that of Kermanshah. The heavy precipitation allows the existence of small glaciers on the highest Zagros peaks – in contrast the Kuhrud Mountains to the east have no glaciers despite being of the same height due to aridity. The long dry season sees only on average 4 millimetres (0.16 in) of rainfall between June and September, with the wet season extending into October, unlike many other Mediterranean climates. At the 2006 National Census, its population was 96,786 in 20,297 households. The following census in 2011 counted 108,505 people in 26,304 households. The latest census in 2016 showed a population of 134,532 people in 34,850 households. The population of Yasuj in 2016, including some suburban villages, is just over 250,000 people. The economy of Yasuj is based on the following local activities: baskets carpets/rugs mosaic tiles bricks livestock feed By 2014 a new refinery will be constructed by the private sector, at a cost of $2.2 billion. It will produce petrol, gasoil, kerosene, furnace oil, liquefied gas, asphalt, and sulfur.
