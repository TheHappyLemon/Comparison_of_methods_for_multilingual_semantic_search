Pürksi (Swedish: Birkas) is a village in Lääne-Nigula Parish, Lääne County, in western Estonia. Pürksi estate was founded in 1620. The building is from 1852. It was the home of artist Johann Carl Emanuel von Ungern-Sternberg (1773-1830), some of whose works are currently at the Art Museum of Estonia, Tallinn. The manor, which lies in a part of Estonia that formerly had a sizeable Swedish minority, is today occupied by a school that is specialised in teaching Swedish.
