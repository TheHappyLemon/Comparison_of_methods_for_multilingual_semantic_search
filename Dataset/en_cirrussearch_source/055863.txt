Established in 1991, AUBG had about 1,000 students from over 40 countries on 5 continents as of Fall 2022. Close to 40% of the students are international. Founded in 1991, the American University in Bulgaria is the first American-style, liberal arts undergraduate education institution in Eastern Europe. The university is a cooperative venture established with the support of the U.S. and Bulgarian governments, the Open Society Institute, the City of Blagoevgrad, and the University of Maine. When it opened its doors in September 1991, AUBG's first-year class was 208 students and it had 16 full-time faculty members. Nowadays, it has around 1000 students from over 40 countries. By May 2019, twenty-four classes of around 5,000 students had graduated from AUBG. The university has three sources of funding: its endowment (which came largely from gifts from the United States Agency for International Development and the Soros Foundation), gifts, and tuition. Baccalaureate degrees conferred by AUBG are accredited in both Bulgaria and the United States. AUBG is institutionally accredited in the United States from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. The university also issues a European Diploma Supplement (part of Europass), which confers automatic recognition of the AUBG degree throughout Europe. For consecutive years, AUBG holds the top position nationally in Business Administration, European Studies, Journalism and Mass Communication, and Political Science and International Relations. The Economics, Computer Science, and Information Systems programs rank second in Bulgaria. A university survey in 2016 found that sixty-five percent of graduating students received more than one job offer or higher degree program acceptance letter when they applied for work or a higher degree upon completing their studies at AUBG. Approximately 20 percent of graduates earned more than $100,000/year and over 20 percent of alumni from 1995 to 2005 who were currently working in the U.S. earned more than $250,000/year. The university follows the traditional American-style of education liberal arts. More than 60% of the students graduate from AUBG with two majors or a major and a minor. More than half of graduating seniors complete double majors, while many undergraduates supplement their main field of study with a minor in one of 19 disciplines offered at AUBG. The university employs about 70 faculty members from over 15 countries. AUBG students can spend a year or a semester at one of several hundred universities in the United States through the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP).

AUBG launched its first Acceleration Program Elevate in 2019. This helps student entrepreneurs and recent alumni start their first businesses. During the four-month program, teams of two to four AUBGers have access to many workshops, training and a mentorship network of experienced entrepreneurs and AUBG alumni. Each team gets $5000 as capital to kick-start their development. Designed to provide students with startup guidance, the accelerator doubles as a way to support the university: AUBG will have a 5% stake in each company that comes out of the program.
