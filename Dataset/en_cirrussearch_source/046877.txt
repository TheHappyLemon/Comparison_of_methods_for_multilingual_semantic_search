Futebol Clube de Famalicão, commonly known as Famalicão, is a Portuguese professional football club from Vila Nova de Famalicão.

Since 1952, Famalicão have played their home matches at the Estádio Municipal 22 de Junho, which holds a 5,307-seat capacity.

The club is owned by Quantum Pacific Group which also has 30% share of Atlético de Madrid. Futebol Clube de Famalicão was founded on the 21 August 1931 by six friends. Their first match was the opening of their ground, the Campo da Berberia, with a match against FC Porto in 1932. Their first kit was green and white, however, they eventually changed it to blue and white in order to get affiliation from Porto. Famalicão started competing in 1932–33 in the Regional Promotion Championship which they won. In 1945–46, the club reached the semi-finals of the Taça de Portugal under Hungarian manager Janos Szabo, but were beaten 11–0 by a Sporting CP team led by Cândido de Oliveira. The club have spent six years in the Primeira Liga in total - 1946–47, 1978–79, and four consecutively from 1990 to 1994.
