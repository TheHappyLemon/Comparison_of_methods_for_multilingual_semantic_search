The Leninist Young Communist League of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Ļeņina Komunistiskā jaunatnes savienība, LĻKJS) was the Latvian branch of the Soviet Komsomol that served as the youth wing of the Communist Party of Latvia from 1940 to 1991. The LĻKJS was founded in 1940, during the Soviet occupation of Latvia, as a union of formerly clandestine communist youth organizations that operated in independent Latvia between the World Wars. Membership of the LĻKJS was predominantly ethnically Latvian, with a substantial Russian minority. In early 1990, delegates at the LĻKJS Congress voted to adopt a new set of organisational statutes independent of the all-Union Komsomol, but not amounting to a full withdrawal. This action was precipitated by the independence of the Estonian and Lithuanian branches of the all-Union Komsomol in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Swain, Geoffrey (2004).
