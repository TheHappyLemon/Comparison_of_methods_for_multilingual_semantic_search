Agaricus silvicola, also known as the wood mushroom or woodland agaricus, is a species of Agaricus mushroom related to the button mushroom. A. silvicola is a member of Agaricus section Arvenses, a group of morphologically similar mushrooms. A. silvicola, like other species in Agaricus section Arvenses, exhibits a positive Schäffer's reaction and potassium hydroxide reaction, and smells of almonds or anise. Originally described as the variety Agaricus campestris var. silvicola by Carlo Vittadini in 1832, it was promoted to distinct species status by Charles Horton Peck in 1873. Varieties with larger bases have been described as A. abruptibulbus. The cap is light cream, and bruises yellow ochre when damaged. It is 5–15 cm (2–6 in) in diameter, which makes it slightly smaller than its close relative Agaricus arvensis, the "horse mushroom." The stem is 5–15 cm (2–6 in), and usually has a bulbous base. It is much the same color as the cap, and has a fragile drooping ring. The flesh is thin and white, and smells of almond or anise. It looks fairly similar to a young death cap. The spores are brown, elliptical, and smooth. Agaricus silvicola grows in both deciduous and coniferous woodland in Britain, Europe, and North America. It has also been reported in South Asia, namely Bangladesh and Pakistan. Appearing in the autumn, it is rarely seen in huge numbers, usually just a few, or solitary. It is edible and popular in Europe. It is suspected to have caused an allergic reaction in a few people in North America. (This reference is not supported by clinical cases).
