The Kivalliq Region (/kɪˈvælɪk/; Inuktitut syllabics: ᑭᕙᓪᓕᖅ) is an administrative region of Nunavut, Canada. It consists of the portion of the mainland to the west of Hudson Bay together with Southampton Island and Coats Island. The regional centre is Rankin Inlet. The population was 11,045 in the 2021 Canadian census, an increase of 6.1% from the 2016 Census. Before 1999, the Kivalliq Region existed under slightly different boundaries as Keewatin Region, Northwest Territories. Although the Kivalliq name became official in 1999, Statistics Canada continued to refer to the area as the Keewatin Region in publications such as the Census until 2021. Most references to the area as "Keewatin" have generally been phased out by Nunavut-based bodies, as that name was originally rooted in a region of northwestern Ontario derived from a Cree dialect, and only saw application onto Inuit-inhabited lands because of the boundaries of the now-defunct District of Keewatin. In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, the Kivalliq Region had a population of 11,045 living in 2,719 of its 3,193 total private dwellings, a change of 6.1% from its 2016 population of 10,413. With a land area of 434,331.16 km2 (167,696.20 sq mi), it had a population density of 0.0/km2 (0.1/sq mi) in 2021.
