2021 in sports describes the year's events in world sport. In mountain running, the Gansu ultramarathon disaster in the Yellow River Stone Forest, China led 21 runners to die from hypothermia. The poor organization of this government-run race led to a national outcry on the regulations of the sport. In sprinting, during the Olympics, Krystsina Tsimanouskaya criticised her Belarusian coaches for entering her in the 4 × 400 m relay, a distance she had never contested, without her consent, after others missed doping tests and were disqualified. Her coaches forced her to fly back to Belarus. She entered the Polish embassy in Tokyo and was granted a humanitarian visa. The International Olympic Committee revoked the accreditation of her coaches and expelled them from the Olympic Village.
