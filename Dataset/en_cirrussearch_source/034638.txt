The town was first mentioned in a 1270 deed issued by Henry of Ostheeren, Bishop of Brandenburg. Then a possession of the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg, it appeared as a town in 1314 under Margrave Waldemar, who in 1317 concluded the Treaty of Templin here, ending the war against Denmark, Mecklenburg and the Duchy of Pomerania. Heavily devastated by Danish troops in the Thirty Years' War, Templin from 1816 on belonged to the Prussian province of Brandenburg near the border with Mecklenburg-Strelitz. From 1912 on, Templin was the seat of the Electoral Brandenburgian boarding school (Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium) established in 1601 by Elector Joachim III Frederick of Hohenzollern at nearby Joachimsthal. The school was finally dissolved in 1953.
