The 1965–66 season of the European Cup football club tournament was won by Real Madrid, winners of the first five European Cups from 1956 to 1960, for the sixth time in a close final against Partizan. Real Madrid eliminated title-holders Internazionale in the semi-finals. Note: Starting in the 1963–64 tournament, only the title holder, Internazionale, joined directly in the first round.
