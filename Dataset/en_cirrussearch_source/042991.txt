Władysław Strzemiński (Polish pronunciation: [vwaˈdɨswaf ʂt͡ʂɛˈmiɲskʲi]; Russian: Владислав Максимилианович Стржеминский, tr. Vladislav Maksimilianovich Strzheminsky; 21 November 1893 – 26 December 1952) was a Polish painter, art theoretician and pedagogue. He is regarded as a pioneer of Constructivist avant-garde of the 1920s and 1930s and the developer of the theory of unism (Polish: unizm). Strzemiński was born in Minsk to a Polish family. In 1914, he graduated from the Military School of Civil Engineering. During World War I he served as second lieutenant at the Osowiec Fortress. In 1915, he was severely wounded in the Attack of the Dead Men. In 1920, he married Katarzyna Kobro. In 1922, he moved to Wilno (now Vilnius), and in the following year supported Vytautas Kairiūkštis in creating the first avant-garde art exhibition in what is now the territory of Lithuania (then part of Poland, under Polish rule). In November 1923, he moved to Warsaw, where with Henryk Berlewi he founded the constructivist group Blok. During the 1920s, he formulated his theory of Unism (Unizm in Polish). His paintings inspired the musical compositions of the Polish composer Zygmunt Krauze. He is an author of a revolutionary book titled "The theory of vision". He was co creator of unique avant-garde art collection in Łódź gathered together thanks to the enthusiasm of members of the "a.r." group as Katarzyna Kobro and Henryk Stażewski (the artists) and Julian Przyboś and Jan Brzękowski (the poets). In postwar Łódź he was an instructor at the Higher School of Plastic Arts and Design Neoplastic Room in Muzeum Sztuki in Łódź, where one of his students was Halina Ołomucki, survivor of the Nazi concentration camps. His Neoplastic Room was installed in the Muzeum Sztuki in Łódź in 1948 but was removed in 1950 as it failed to fit in with the socialist realism aesthetic imposed by Włodzimierz Sokorski, the minister of culture of the Polish United Workers' Party. His works have been exhibited in such museums around the world as Centre Pompidou, Museo Reina Sofia, Moderna Museet Malmö and Whitechapel Gallery. He is the subject of Afterimage (2016), the final film by Andrzej Wajda.
