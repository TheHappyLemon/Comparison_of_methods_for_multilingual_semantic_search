In 2019, TMZ reported that family and friends of McClurg filed court documents requesting a conservatorship to manage her affairs. They said neurological tests provide evidence that McClurg is unable to live alone without assistance and is "especially vulnerable to undue influence, given her poor judgment and evident dementia". TMZ further reported that a conservator, McClurg's cousin, Angelique Cabral, had been appointed. In August 2022, the lawyer for the conservatorship filed court documents alleging that McClurg had been abused by a man who had befriended her, moved into her home, and become a court-approved caregiver. The documents allege the man sexually assaulted her and a police report had been filed with the LAPD. They further allege that the man tried to remove her from the state to marry her. The judge for the conservatorship granted an order of protection at hearings in September 2022.[needs update] The Paragon of Comedy (1983 – television special) Christmas Everyday (1986 – television special) Tiny Toons Spring Break (1994 – television special) Life with Louie: A Christmas Surprise for Mrs. Stillman ...
