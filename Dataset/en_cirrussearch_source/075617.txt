Progress M-58 (Russian: Прогресс М-58), identified by NASA as Progress 23P, was a Progress spacecraft used to resupply the International Space Station. It was a Progress-M 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 358. Progress M-58 was launched by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Launch occurred at 13:40:36 UTC on 23 October 2006. The spacecraft docked with the aft port of the Zvezda module at 14:28:46 UTC on 26 October 2006. During docking a problem with the spacecraft's telemetry system produced a false reading that an antenna associated with its Kurs docking system had failed to retract, complicating the docking procedure. It remained docked for 152 days before undocking at 18:11 UTC on 27 March 2007. It was deorbited at 22:44:30 UTC on 27 March 2007. The spacecraft burned up in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean, with any remaining debris landing in the ocean at around 23:30:22 GMT. Progress M-58 carried supplies to the International Space Station, including food, water and oxygen for the crew and equipment for conducting scientific research.
