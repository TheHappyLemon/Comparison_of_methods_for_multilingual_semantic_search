Since then, he established himself as a fan favourite, being protagonist of the rossoblu's return to Serie A, and then being appointed vice-captain for the team. He announced his retirement in June 2010, at the age of 34, contemporaneously confirming his interest in becoming a football coach. Jurić made his international debut for Croatia in a friendly match against Romania on 11 February 2009 and went on to play five times with his national team, though did not score any goals. His final international was a September 2009 World Cup qualification match against Belarus. After retiring as a football, Jurić stayed at Genoa as youth team coach for the 2010–11 season.

His Crotone side won promotion in 2015–16 season to the top flight Serie A for the 2016–17 season for the first time in the club's history. After achieving promotion with Crotone, he was offered to replace his mentor Gasperini at his former club Genoa in June 2016, which he accepted, thus becoming the new head coach of the Grifone.

In July 2019 he was appointed at the helm of newly promoted Serie A club Hellas Verona. Under his tenure with the Gialloblu, he competed in two top flight seasons with impressive results despite having one of the smallest budgets of the league.
