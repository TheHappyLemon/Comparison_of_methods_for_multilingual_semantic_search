Safran S.A. is a French multinational aerospace and defense corporation that designs, develops and manufactures aircraft engines, helicopter engines, spacecraft propulsion systems as well as various other aerospace and military equipment. The company arose in 2005 through a merger between SNECMA and defense electronics specialist SAGEM. Safran's acquisition of Zodiac Aerospace in 2018 significantly expanded its aeronautical activities. Employing over 92,000 people and generating 23.2 billion euros in revenue in 2023, the company is listed on the Euronext stock exchange and is part of the CAC 40 and Euro Stoxx 50. Its headquarters are located in Paris. The name Safran was chosen from 4,250 suggestions, including 1,750 proposed by employees. As a holding company for many subsidiaries, the name was deemed suitable for the suggestion of direction, movement, and strategy. Safran translates as rudder blade and as saffron, which the company highlights as one of the catalysts for early international trade. In 1905 Louis Seguin created the company Gnome. Production of the first rotary engine for airplanes, the Gnome Omega, started in 1909. This company merged with Le Rhône, a company created in 1912 by Louis Verdet, to form the Gnome et Rhône engine company. Gnome & Rhône was nationalized in 1945, creating Snecma. In 2000, this company gave its name to the “Snecma Group”, and carried out a number of acquisitions to form a larger group with an array of complementary businesses. Sagem (Société d’Applications Générales de l’Electricité et de la Mécanique) was created in 1925 by Marcel Môme. In 1939, Sagem entered the telephone and transmissions market by taking control of Société anonyme des télécommunications (SAT).It acquired Société de Fabrication d’Instruments de Mesure (Sfim), a measurement instrument specialist, in 1999. However, by 2008 Sagem Mobile and Sagem Communications had been sold. Sagem Mobile became Sagem Wireless in January 2009. The Safran Group was created on 11 May 2005 with the merger of Snecma and Sagem SA. In June 2014, Arianespace CEO Stéphane Israël announced that European efforts to remain competitive in response to SpaceX's recent success have begun in earnest. This included the creation of a new joint venture company from Arianespace's two largest shareholders: the launch-vehicle producer Airbus and engine-producer Safran. By May 2015, Safran had created with Airbus Group a launcher joint venture called Airbus Safran Launchers. This entity is currently developing the Ariane 6 launch vehicle for initial flights in the 2020s. In January 2017, Safran initiated a takeover of the aircraft interior supplier Zodiac Aerospace to create the third largest aerospace supplier with $22.5 billion revenue, behind United Technologies with $28.2 billion and GE Aviation with $24.7 billion; the new group will be 92,000-employee strong, with 48% of its business in aircraft systems and equipment, from landing gears to seats, 46% in propulsion and 6% in defense. In May 2017, Safran announced the completion of the sale of its identity and security activities to Advent International for Euro 2.4 billion. In February 2018, Safran took control of Zodiac Aerospace, significantly expanding its aircraft equipment activities. Zodiac Aerospace has 32,500 employees and generated sales of 5.1 billion euros for its fiscal year ended 31 August 2017. On 4 June 2018 Boeing and Safran announced their 50-50 partnership to design, build and service auxiliary power units after regulatory and antitrust clearance in the second half of 2018. This could threaten the dominance of Honeywell and United Technologies. In July 2023, Safran agreed to acquire Raytheon subsidiary Collins Aerospace's actuation and flight controls business unit in an all-cash deal worth $1.8 billion however the Italian government used its Golden Share in Microtecnica to veto the sale in the belief it would give Safran the commercial ability to sabotage Eurofighter components production, RTX is legally challenging the use of the veto. The Safran group is divided into three main branches: The aerospace propulsion branch groups all operations concerning the propulsion of aeroplanes, helicopters, missiles, and launchers, for the civil aviation, military aviation, and space markets: design, production, marketing, testing, maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO). Safran Aircraft Engines (formerly Snecma Moteurs) Commercial & military engines, liquid propulsion for space launchers Safran Helicopter Engines Turboshaft engines for helicopters Jet engines for training and support aircraft Turbines for missiles and drones (Microturbo subsidiary) APU (Microturbo subsidiary). Safran provides APU systems since 1962.
