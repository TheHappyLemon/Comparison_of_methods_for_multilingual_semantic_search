Dr. Irena Gjoni, Poeti shqiptar, Studies on the Creativity of Jeton Kelmendi ISBN 978-99943-0-342-7 Acad. Constantin Barbu, Codul meu pentru mâine (My code for tomorrow) ISBN 978-606-41-2107-3 "Jeton Kelmendi's name in poetry is the part that gives meaning to this art, while the poetry of this European author is large and very dimensional. The poet Kelmendi has so much power to introduce you into his poetic art that he creates the conviction that his words are alive and you cannot leave reading". Prof. Ernesto Kahan, Professor Emeritus, Israel NOBEL Peace Prize 1985 "Prefers to better propagate within his heart than in the exotic exterior world, filtering the intuition behind his characters. Again, his instant art is amazing the skill that uses. His poems often summarized several times in a few words. This is touching, due to its concerns and shortcomings." Acad. Athanase Vantchev de Thracym, France "With inspiring flowers, and the words flow easily translated, he has literary persistent effects, which can be found in this volume. Jeton Kelmendi leads us in the twenty-first century, with a name that is becoming greater." Christopher Lawrence, England "Our author has the ability to move through different times: long distance, ancient, not so far, present and future. This is probably his strength about what he presents before the cosmopolitan readers." Prof. Dr. RICHARD A. BROSIO, University of Michigan, Professor Emeritus, USA How to reach yourself, 2010.
