We realized it was time for some tough decisions. Originally we had planned to do this only as long as it was fun and came naturally. Now we’re going to bury Stalingrad Cowgirls with honor and smiling through the tears” - Enni Kivelä Enni Kivelä (born 1990) - vocals, guitar Henna Vaarala (born 1990) - bass, backing vocals Riina Kivelä (born 1988) - drums, backing vocals Somewhere High (19 September 2007) (FIN) / (January ?? 2008) (SWE, NO) Kiss Your Heart Goodbye (5 May 2010) (FIN) / (27 September 2010) (SWE, NO, DK) You Won't Get It (2007) Let Me Make It Real (2007) Sukset (2008) Baby Girl (2010) 911 (2010) You Won't Get It (2007) Baby Girl (2010) Dead Ripper (June 2009).
