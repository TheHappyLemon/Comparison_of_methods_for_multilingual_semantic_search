Grimma (Upper Sorbian: Grima, pronounced [ˈɡʁʲima]) is a town in Saxony, Central Germany, on the left bank of the Mulde, 25 kilometres (16 mi) southeast of Leipzig. Founded in c. 1170,[citation needed] it is part of the Leipzig district. The town is in northern Saxony, 25 kilometres (16 miles) southeast of Leipzig and 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) south of Wurzen. The river Mulde flows through the town, a significant section of which is situated in a floodplain. Massive floods in 2002 washed away the old Pöppelmannbrücke bridge and caused significant damage to buildings in the town. In the summer of 2013 there was further flood damage.

The town was chosen as one of three government elite boarding schools, the 'Princely Schools of Saxony', in 1550. The purpose of these schools was to educate future civil servants and to prepare them for further studies at universities which is why a number of historical personalities are biographically related to this rather small town. The Gymnasium St. Augustine still exists today as one of only a few public boarding schools in Saxony. Grimma was the scene of witch trials between 1494 and 1701. At least two women were executed as witches. Due to the town being located at the second main railway line between Leipzig and Dresden (via Meissen), the town developed well in the 19th century. By 1890 the population had reached 8,957. The town was affected by heavy flooding in 2013. Work had by this time started on the construction of flood barriers, but their completion had been delayed by local opposition In 2017, the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference held their international, triennial convention in Grimma. Grimma has been the site of many historic structures, including a town hall dating from 1442, a famous school (the Fürstenschule) erected on the site of a former Augustinian monastery in 1550, and a school of brewing.
