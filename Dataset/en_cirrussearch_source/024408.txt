Population: 21,221 (2022 estimate). It is located about half way between the regional center Kropyvnytskyi (west), and cities of Oleksandriia (east) and Svitlovodsk (north). The lands of the modern Kirovohrad Oblast and the Znamianka territorial hromada were first inhabited by Scythians, it was near the Znamianka that a bronze and golden image of the Scythian eagle was found, which is now a symbol of the region. In the Middle Ages, during the time of Kyivan Rus', the East Slavic tribe of Ulichis lived here. After the liberation of the former Kyivan Rus' from the Tatars in the Battle of Blue Waters and the unification of the principalities of Kyiv, Pereyaslav, and Chernihiv with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, there was a need to protect the southeastern borders from attacks by the Crimean Khanate and Moscovy - states that were formed after the collapse of the Golden Horde at the end of the 15th century . For this , Dmytro Vyshnevetsky founded the first Zaporozhian Sich on the island of Khortytsia, thus the Ukrainian Cossacs appeared. On the territory of the modern Kirovohrad region the Zaporozhians founded many villages near the territory of modern Znamianka , like Moshoryne and Subottsi. After the destruction of the Zaporizhzhya Cossacks by the Russians in 1775, the lands of central Ukraine came under the direct authority of Russian Empire Znamianka was established in 1869 when there started train movement between Kharkiv and Odesa in area that historically was known as Black Forest (or Nigra Sylva). At the meadow of Black Forest, through which stretched a segment of Yelizavetgrad – Kriukov (west–east), there was built the train station main building and its offices. The station was named after the original village Znamianka that was located 3 km (1.9 mi) away and today is known as Znamianka Druha.

Znamianka became a train station at four-way crossroads northeast towards Kremenchuk, south towards Mykolaiv, west towards Balta and northwest towards Fastiv. Simultaneously with building of the train station on a land lot that was rent out from landowners Osipovs by people from neighboring villages and other counties (uyezds), there appeared a small settlement of railway workers, Osipovoye. In 1886 there already were 24 private houses, an earth shelter, six trading places and population of 143. Couple of dozens years later just south of the train station there appeared another settlement of Linitskoye. In 1913 in both Osipovoye and Linitskoye lived about 6,000 people. In the beginning for sometime the train station was classified of the third category with its locomotive depot accounting for 4 locomotives.
