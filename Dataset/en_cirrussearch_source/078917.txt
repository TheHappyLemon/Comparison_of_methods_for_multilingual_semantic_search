Later in 1922 he played briefly with ASK Riga until he ended up with the newly founded RFK – the leader in Latvian football in the years to follow, plus he actively participated in the formation of the club in its early years. Along with his brother Arvīds he was selected to play in the first ever international match for Latvia on 24 September 1922.
