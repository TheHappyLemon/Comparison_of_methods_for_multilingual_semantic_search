Obstacle jumping was one of five equestrian competitions held in late May and early June 1900 at the International Horse Show in Paris. The event was part of the Exposition Universelle, and later classified as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics. It was similar to the modern show jumping event. 45 competitors entered, though only 37 competed, with some information unknown. The event was won by Aimé Haegeman of Belgium, with his countryman Georges Van Der Poele taking second and Louis de Champsavin of France in third. This was the first appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the only event on the current programme that was held in 1900. The course was 850 metres (2,790 ft) long with 22 jumps, including a double jump and a triple jump as well as a 4 metres (13 ft) water jump. The average height of the jumps was 1.1 metres (3 ft 7 in). Both military and non-military riders (and their mounts) were allowed to compete, excluding military school horses. The scoring format is not known. A single round was held. Riders could apparently compete multiple times on difference horses. Nothing is known of scores for faults; the winners were listed by reference to their times only. That Jéhin rode Bistouri, a horse which he owned, is presumed by de Wael. De Wael notes that it is uncertain if Murat actually was the rider, but argues for it on the basis that Murat was the owner of Arcadius and is known to have ridden in other events.
