The 2023 IIHF World Championship Division II were two international ice hockey tournaments run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The Group A tournament was held in Madrid, Spain from 16 to 22 April and the Group B tournament in Istanbul, Turkey from 17 to 23 April 2023. Spain won the Group A tournament and got promoted, while Iceland finished last, but Georgia was later disqualified by the IIHF and relegated[why?]. The United Arab Emirates won Group B and got promoted and Mexico was relegated. Four referees and seven linesmen were selected for the tournament. After the tournament was completed, the IIHF invalidated the results of Georgia and assigned it zero points in the IIHF World Ranking.[why?] Georgia was relegated to Division II B for 2024, while Iceland, the last-placed team, retained its place in this division.
