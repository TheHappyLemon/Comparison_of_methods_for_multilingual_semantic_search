The IWI Negev (also known as the Negev NG-5) is a 5.56×45mm NATO light machine gun developed by Israel Weapon Industries (IWI), formerly Israel Military Industries Ltd. (IMI). In 2012, IWI introduced the Negev NG-7, which is chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO. The NG stands for Next Generation. Both variants of the Negev are in service with the Israel Defense Forces. The Negev started development in 1985 by Israel Military Industries (now Israel Weapon Industries) to replace the then in service Galil ARM. The Negev entered service with the IDF in 1997, after extensive testing conducted by the IDF Ordnance Corps. The Negev is a gas-operated, air-cooled, open bolt, select-fire, light machine gun (LMG) with a rotating bolt. The Negev uses a long-stroke gas piston system that runs under the barrel and is connected directly to the bolt carrier, the gas system comes with a three position gas regulator for use with different feed types and conditions. The design was made to be reliable, especially in adverse conditions. It was officially adopted by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in 1997. The Negev has a quick-change chrome-lined cold hammer forged barrel. The barrel is fitted with a slotted flash suppressor and a folding ambidextrous carry handle, which is used to carry the weapon and remove the barrel of the Negev. During the weapon's initial development a barrel with a 1 in (25 mm) (1:12 in) rifling twist rate was also planned, adapted for the lightweight M193 cartridge. Additionally, a multifunction muzzle device was designed, used to launch rifle grenades. The Negev's iron sights (closed-type) consist of a front post (adjustable for both windage and elevation) and a rear aperture sight with an elevation adjustment drum, with 300 to 1,000 m range settings in 100 m increments. The sight line radius is 440 millimeters (17.3 in). The Negev is equipped with tritium sights for night-time operations, the vials are embedded into the front and rear sights, with a night sight exposed on the rear aperture. The Negev has its sight rail mounted to the frame of the gun, and not the feed top cover, which is detached when reloading. This allows it to stay zeroed for a longer period of time when mounting red-dot, reflex sights or other optics. The classic Negev did not possess the modern standardized Picatinny rail, and instead came with a welded adapter for an optical sight. The newer NG-5 and NG-7 have a standard picatinny rail, and in Israel are usually fitted with an optical scope similar to thee standard scopes of Israeli assault rifles. The full size Negev and Negev SF was originally manufactured with a metal-tube, fixed-length, folding (right) stock. This classic tube skeleton stock was a modified stock from the Galil rifle. The design of the Negev's recoil springs and non-reciprocating handle, allow the Negev to fire with the skeleton stock folded; however during reload the bolt cannot be actuated with the stock folded. The Negev NG-5 came fitted with an adjustable length folding stock, that folds to the opposite direction to allow complete operation of the gun with the stock folded, with cheek well adjustment, allowing for easier fitting. Every variant of the Negev can have a folding bipod, installed to the forward end of the handguard and folded under and becoming part of the handguard when stowed. The receiver also has slots and hooks used to secure the weapon to vehicle mounting hardware, including helicopters. The Negev SF 'Commando' variants also come with a 45 degree forward grip "assault handle", allowing controlled fire while not using the bipod. The assault grip and bipod can be installed together, however the bipod cannot be folded with the assault grip installed. The classic Negev could be fitted with mounting hardware on the handguard to allow users to mount a laser pointer. Current Negev models come mounting positions for bipods and the "assault grip" as well as a number of picatinny rails, including on the handguard allowing users to mount other hardware, including: laser pointers or laser target and illumination devices. The standard Negev is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO, optimized for the SS109 cartridge. The Negev NG-7 and 7 ULMG variants are chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO. The Negev feeds from an M27 disintegrating, open-link ammunition belt, carried in a 150-round fabric container that clips into the magazine well, or alternatively from a 35-round box magazine from the Galil assault rifle, or a 30-round STANAG magazine from the M16 rifle (with the use of an adapter). 200-round ammunition belt containers are also available. Belted ammunition is introduced into the feed tray port from the left side, while the magazine is inserted vertically into the magazine well at the base of the receiver. The feed system, which loosely copies the Czechoslovakian Vz. 52 and the PK, uses a lever mounted on the left wall of the receiver and driven by a cam in the recoiling bolt carrier to turn a small feed pawl. The belt is pushed by the pawl only during the rearward movement of the bolt carrier. The Negev 7 ULMG and ULMG SF, can be converted to 6.5mm Creedmoor cartridge by changing barrels; and feed from standard M13 disintegrating links. Negev (1997-2012) – Released in 1997. It has a barrel length of 460 mm (18.11 inches) and can be fired either in semi or fully automatic. The pre-NG Negev came with a folding, fixed length skeleton stock, that is still available. Negev SF (1997-2012) – The Negev SF, or "Commando" version, is a compact variant of the Negev. It uses a shorter barrel and is primarily fitted with a side grip (NEGEV Assault Grip). It has a barrel length of 330 mm (12.99 inches). Negev (2012-present) – Previously named 'Negev NG-5' has been renamed the Negev. The Negev is available with the original Galil-like stock, or an updated adjustable folding stock. Negev SF (2012-present) – A compact variant of the Negev NG-5. It uses a shorter barrel and is primarily fitted with the Negev assault grip. It has a barrel length of 330 mm (13 in). The Negev NG-5 SF has been renamed to the Negev SF. The updated Negev SF has a folding adjustable stock, with adjustable cheek well. Negev NG-7 (2012-present) – Chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. It has a barrel length of 508 mm (20.0 inches) and is select-fire. It is fed by a 100- or 125-round assault drum magazine containing disintegrating M13 NATO standard ammunition belts or NATO standard ammunition belts and has two gas regulator settings as the possibility for box magazine feeding was omitted. The IWI eLog weapon-embedded sensor module was added to collect and store data on the actual use of the weapons for more efficient maintenance management and servicing by armourers. Negev NG-7 SF (2012-present) – A compact variant of the Negev NG-7. It uses a shorter barrel and is primarily fitted with a side grip (Negev assault grip). It has a barrel length of 420 mm (16.5 inches). Negev NG-7 SF 13 (2012-present) – Identical to the NG-7 SF but with a 330 mm (13.0 in) barrel. Negev 7 ULMG (2023-present) – Released in 2023, based on customer feedback for a lighter alternative to the NG-7. The ULMG is fitted with the same barrel as the NG-7 SF, a 420 mm (16.5 in) long barrel that is shorter than NG-7, and it is 1.4 kg lighter than the NG-7. The ULMG can be converted to 6.5mm Creedmoor by changing barrels. Negev 7 ULMG SF – a compact variant of the Negev 7 ULMG, fitted with a 330 mm (13.0 in) long barrel.  Azerbaijan  Brazil: Used by Military Police of São Paulo State, Military Police of Amazonas State  Cameroon: Used by Battalion d'intervention rapide  Colombia  Costa Rica  Cyprus: Used by mechanised infantry, paratroopers and the Special Forces.  Democratic Republic of Congo: Used by Presidential Guard units in 2010  Equatorial Guinea  Estonia  Georgia Since May 2010, standard issue light machine gun of the GAF.
