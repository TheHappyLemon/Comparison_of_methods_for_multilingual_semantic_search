"Himni i Flamurit" (transl. "Hymn to the Flag") is the national anthem of Albania, adopted in 1912. Its music is derived from the Romanian patriotic song "Pe-al nostru steag e scris Unire", composed by Ciprian Porumbescu. The lyrics, which are close to the original Romanian lyrics, were written by Albanian poet Asdreni. The anthem was originally titled "Betimi mbi Flamur" ("The Pledge on the Flag"). First voice recording of the anthem (1918) Performed on September 1918 by Arbëresh tenor Giuseppe Mauro, assisted by music producer and patriot of the national movement Spiridon Ilo Problems playing this file? See media help. On 21 April 1912, "Betimi mbi Flamur" was first published as a poem in Liri e Shqipërisë (Freedom of Albania), an Albanian newspaper in Sofia, Bulgaria. It was later printed in a volume of poems by Drenova titled Ëndra e lotë (Dreams and tears) which was published in Bucharest. According to Lasgush Poradeci's memoirs, the anthem, created by the adaptation of the text to the music, was not originally intended to be a national anthem, but it was so well liked by the people that it was proclaimed as the national anthem in 1912, and it was with its music that the Albanian flag was raised during the Albanian Proclamation of Independence in Vlore. A Hungarian composer, György Ligeti, opined that the music composed by Porumbescu is rooted in Germanic and Austrian musical traditions, though this is not a definitive groundbreaking explanation of its influence and later creation. It is a view based on Porumbescu's musical education, since he had studied at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna. The view has been shared by Albanian musicologist, Ramadan Sokoli. The second half of each verse is considered refrain and is repeated. Usually only the first stanza of the anthem is performed, such as during sporting events. Albanian alphabet has historically been written in a number of different alphabets. Apostrophes represent the elision of word-final ë's, and representation of this among different sources varies. See Help:IPA/Albanian and Albanian phonology. Atij ("it") is sometimes replaced with atje ([a.tjɛ]; "there"), and duke u is sometimes written duk' iu, duk' ju or similar. Po ("but") is sometimes written por, an ancestral form. Alongside the standard form vend ("place") one can also find the variant vënd, found in most Tosk dialects, with which the lyrics were originally written, as evidenced by the now lost rhyme with kënd. Për ("for") is sometimes written pë, and atdheun ("homeland") is sometimes written atdhenë. Only when the first verse alone is performed. See Albanian alphabet and its references.
