The lanterne rouge is the competitor in last place in the Tour de France. The phrase comes from the French for "Red Lantern" and refers to the red lantern hung on the rear vehicle of a passenger railway train or the brake van of a freight train, which signalmen would look for in order to make sure none of the couplings had become disconnected. In the Tour de France the rider who finishes last, rather than dropping out along the way, is accorded the distinction of lanterne rouge. Because of the popularity it affords, riders may compete for the last position rather than settling for a place near the back. Often the rider who comes last is remembered while those a few places ahead are forgotten. The revenue the last rider will generate from later appearance fees can be greater than if he had finished second to last, although this was more true when riders still made much of their income from post-Tour criteriums. In the 1979 Tour de France, Gerhard Schönbacher and Philippe Tesnière were on the last two spots in the general classification, less than one minute apart. Tesnière had already finished last in the 1978 Tour, so he was aware of the publicity associated with being the lanterne rouge. In the 21st stage, a time trial, Tesnière therefore rode slowly. The winner of the time trial, Bernard Hinault, took 1 hour, 8 minutes and 53 seconds to cover the 48.8 km, Schönbacher used 1 hour, 21 minutes and 52 seconds, while Tesniere rode it in 1 hour, 23 minutes and 32 seconds; both were slower than all other cyclists. Tesnière's time was more than 20% slower than Hinault's, which meant that he had missed the time cut, and was taken out of the race. The Tour organisation did not like the attention that the lanterne rouge received, and for the 1980 Tour devised a rule to make it more difficult to finish last: between the 14th and the 20th stage, the rider last in the general classification was removed from the race. Still, Schönbacher managed to finish last in that race. Before the Tour, Schönbacher was promised by his sponsor that he would receive extra money if he finished in last place. After the last stage of the Tour, his team leader Patrick Lefevere told Schönbacher that he would not get the money, and after a heated discussion, Schönbacher was fired. Red lantern holders are often great sprinters or great riders of shorter races who are not fit enough for such a long race as the Tour de France, or who try to finish the race despite injury, as in the case of Sam Bennett, who finished last after breaking a finger in the opening stage of the 2016 Tour, but eventually won the green jersey in 2020. In 2018 Lawson Craddock became the first rider in the history of the Tour de France to have the distinction of lanterne rouge for all stages of the entire tour. He crashed in the 1st stage resulting in facial lacerations and a fractured scapula. Despite his left eye being smashed and the pain of fractured scapula, he continued to race and finished the stage which led to a picture of his bloodied and grimacing face going viral. Later that day he posted an announcement on social media that he was donating $100 for every stage he finished to the Greater Houston Cycling Association to help rebuild the Alkek Velodrome that had been damaged by Hurricane Harvey. A GoFundMe page was also setup for donations to go directly to the velodrome. Craddock continued to ride all the remaining stages which garnered much publicity for the fundraising efforts and eventually over US$250,000 being raised for the cause. In this case the lanterne rouge has been described as being worn as "a badge of courage" and winning it as "a triumph of sporting endeavour". 1903  Arsène Millocheau (FRA) 1904  Antoine Deflotrière (FRA) 1905  Clovis Lacroix (FRA) 1906  Georges Bronchard (FRA) 1907  Albert Chartier (FRA) 1908  Henri Anthoine (FRA) 1909  Georges Devilly (FRA) 1910  Constant Collet (FRA) 1911  Lucien Roquebert (FRA) 1912  Maurice Lartigue (FRA) 1913  Henri Alavoine (FRA) 1914  Henri Leclerc (FRA) 1915–18: no tour due to World War I 1919  Jules Nempon (FRA) 1920  Charles Raboisson (FRA) 1921  Henri Catelan (FRA) 1922  Daniel Masson (FRA) 1923  Daniel Masson (FRA) 1924  Victor Lafosse (FRA) 1925  Fernand Besnier (FRA) 1926  André Drobecq (FRA) 1927  Jacques Pfister (FRA) 1928  Edouard Persin (FRA) 1929  André Léger (FRA) 1930  Marcel Ilpide (FRA) 1931  Richard Lamb (AUS) 1932  Rudolf Risch (GER) 1933  Ernest Neuhard (FRA) 1934  Antonio Folco (ITA) 1935  Willy Kutschbach (GER) 1936  Aldo Bertocco (FRA) 1937  Aloyse Klensch (LUX) 1938  Janus Hellemons (NED) 1939  Armand Le Moal (FRA) 1940–46: no tour due to World War II 1947  Pietro Tarchini (SUI) 1948  Vittorio Seghezzi (ITA) 1949  Guido De Santi (ITA) 1950  Fritz Zbinden (SUI) 1951  Abdel-Kader Zaaf (FRA) 1952  Henri Paret (FRA) 1953  Claude Rouer (FRA) 1954  Marcel Dierkens (LUX) 1955  Tony Hoar (GBR) 1956  Roger Chaussabel (FRA) 1957  Guy Million (FRA) 1958  Walter Favre (SUI) 1959  Louis Bisilliat (FRA) 1960  José Herrero Berrendero (ESP) 1961  André Geneste (FRA) 1962  Augusto Marcaletti (ITA) 1963  Willy Derboven (BEL) 1964  Anatole Novak (FRA) 1965  Joseph Groussard (FRA) 1966  Paolo Mannucci (ITA) 1967  Jean-Pierre Genet (FRA) 1968  John Clarey (GBR) 1969  André Wilhelm (FRA) 1970  Frits Hoogerheide (NED) 1971  Georges Chappe (FRA) 1972  Alain Bellouis (FRA) 1973  Jacques-André Hochart (FRA) 1974  Lorenzo Alaimo (ITA) 1975  Jacques Boulas (FRA) 1976  Aad van den Hoek (NED) 1977  Roger Loysch (BEL) 1978  Philippe Tesnière (FRA) 1979  Gerhard Schönbacher (AUT) 1980  Gerhard Schönbacher (AUT) 1981  Faustino Cueli (ESP) 1982  Werner Devos (BEL) 1983  Marcel Laurens (BEL) 1984  Gilbert Glaus (SUI) 1985  Manrico Ronchiato (ITA) 1986  Ennio Salvador (ITA) 1987  Mathieu Hermans (NED) 1988  Dirk Wayenberg (BEL) 1989  Mathieu Hermans (NED) 1990  Rodolfo Massi (ITA) 1991  Rob Harmeling (NED) 1992  Fernando Quevedo (ESP) 1993  Edwig Van Hooydonck (BEL) 1994  John Talen (NED) 1995  Bruno Cornillet (FRA) 1996  Jean-Luc Masdupuy (FRA) 1997  Philippe Gaumont (FRA) 1998  Damien Nazon (FRA) 1999  Jacky Durand (FRA) 2000  Olivier Perraudeau (FRA) 2001  Jimmy Casper (FRA) 2002  Igor Flores (ESP) 2003  Hans De Clercq (BEL) 2004  Jimmy Casper (FRA) 2005  Iker Flores (ESP) 2006  Wim Vansevenant (BEL) 2007  Wim Vansevenant (BEL) 2008  Wim Vansevenant (BEL) 2009  Yauheni Hutarovich (BLR) 2010  Adriano Malori (ITA) 2011  Fabio Sabatini (ITA) 2012  Jimmy Engoulvent (FRA) 2013  Svein Tuft (CAN) 2014  Ji Cheng (CHN) 2015  Sébastien Chavanel (FRA) 2016  Sam Bennett (IRE) 2017  Luke Rowe (GBR) 2018  Lawson Craddock (USA) 2019  Sebastian Langeveld (NED) 2020  Roger Kluge (GER) 2021  Tim Declercq (BEL) 2022  Caleb Ewan (AUS) 2023  Michael Mørkøv (DEN) Spain's Igor Flores received the lanterne rouge in 2002, and his brother Iker Flores received it in 2005.

The rest of the world received its first red lantern in 1931, and eventually equaled France's total of 53 in 2019, and overtook it with 54 in 2020.
