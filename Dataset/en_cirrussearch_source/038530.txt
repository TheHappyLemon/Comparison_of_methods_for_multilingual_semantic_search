Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing series administered by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body. The "formula" in the name alludes to a series of rules set by the FIA to which all participants and vehicles are required to conform. The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. A points scoring system is used for each Grand Prix held over the course of the F1 season to determine the outcome of two annual championships, one for drivers (World Drivers' Championship) since 1950, and one for constructors (World Constructors' Championship) since 1958. Each driver accumulates championship points individually in the World Drivers' Championship and collectively for the team they compete for in the World Constructors' Championship. Both championships are formally awarded at the end-of-season FIA Prize Giving Ceremony to the driver and team with the most points. As of the 2024 Australian Grand Prix,[update] 352 drivers have scored Drivers' Championship points, and 70 out of 170 teams have scored Constructors' Championship points, in 1,104 World Championship races. Lewis Hamilton has the highest Drivers' Championship points total with 4647.5, Sebastian Vettel is second with 3098 and Max Verstappen is third with 2637.5. Scuderia Ferrari holds the record for the highest Constructors' Championship points total with 9765, Red Bull Racing is second with 7345, and Mercedes is third with 7248.5. Drivers received an equal points distribution share if they shared a car with another or set the same fastest lap as another between 1950 and 1957. Second drivers of teams who officially entered only one car were ineligible for points on two occasions involving three drivers. Jim Clark is the most dominant Drivers' Champion in terms of points scored, with a maximum of 54 points (7 and 6 wins, respectively) in both 1963 and 1965. More recently, Michael Schumacher finished on the podium in every race in the 2002 season, earning 144 of a possible 170 points. The most dominant Constructors' Champion in recent times was McLaren in 1988, scoring 199 of a maximum 240 points and finishing 134 points ahead of its nearest rival. In 2002, Ferrari scored 221 points, as many as all the other teams combined. Robert Kubica has the longest time between two successive points-scoring results: 8 years and 256 days (between the 2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and the 2019 German Grand Prix). Michael Schumacher has the longest time between his first and last points-scoring results: he scored his first points in the 1991 Italian Grand Prix and his last at the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix, a span of 21 years, 2 months, and 17 days. Hamilton holds the record for most consecutive points-scoring results at 48 Grands Prix: from the 2018 British Grand Prix to the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix. Max Verstappen is the youngest driver to score a championship point; he finished seventh at the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix when he was 17 years and 180 days old. Philippe Étancelin is the oldest driver to score a championship point; he was 53 years and 249 days old when he finished fifth at the 1950 Italian Grand Prix. The points scoring has been changed several times throughout F1 history. Participants in every season until 1990 could only achieve Drivers' Championship points for their best-placed finishes in a specified maximum number of races. Up until 1979, most years saw only the highest-scoring participant in each Grand Prix for each constructor contributing points towards the Drivers' title. From 1950 to 1959, the top five finishers of each race plus the fastest lap setter tallied points. The format was expanded to include the first six finishers of each event between 1960 and 2002 but with no point for fastest lap. In 2003, the FIA revised the structure to the top eight finishers of each race. The FIA extended the system again to include the first ten Grand Prix finishers in 2010. Each Grand Prix winner tallied 8 points from 1950 to 1960, 9 from 1961 to 1990, 10 between 1991 and 2009, and 25 since 2010. Half points were awarded for six Grands Prix that were red-flagged before a certain threshold in a race progression was reached (at different times being either 60% or 75% of the scheduled race distance); starting from around 1977 to 1980 until the end of the 2021 season, no points were able to be accumulated should a race conclude early with the leader having completed two or fewer laps. Following the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix in which half points were awarded to the first ten finishers despite no racing laps being completed, the standards by which a driver can tally championship points should a Grand Prix be suspended before full distance is covered and not be restarted, were changed to a gradual scale system beginning in 2022. No points are awarded unless the race leader completes two or more racing laps without the intervention of a safety car or virtual safety car. Only the top five finishers are eligible for championship points if the race leader completes more than two racing laps but covers less than 25% of the race distance. That switches to the top nine places should the race leader complete between 25% and 50% of race distance. If the race leader covers between 50% and 75% of race distance then participants finishing in the top ten positions tally points. Full championship points are tallied should the race leader complete 75% or more of the scheduled race distance. Following initial confusion over how points were awarded at the 2022 Japanese Grand Prix, the FIA clarified the drivers are also eligible for full points if the race finishes under green flag conditions regardless of the percentage of the scheduled race distance that has been covered. In 2023, the FIA clarified that shortened races would be subject to the gradual scale system "if the race distance from the start signal to the end-of-session signal is less than the scheduled race distance." Sprint qualifying was introduced in 2021 to set the starting order at three Grands Prix that season and the top three finishers of each of these mini-races received points. The first eight drivers were awarded points in three sprint races in 2022, and in six sprint races in 2023. The fastest lap bonus point was re-introduced in 2019, however only drivers and constructors who finished in the top ten are eligible to score the point. From 2022, the fastest lap point is only awarded if 50% or more of the scheduled race distance is completed. Unlike various other motor racing series (e.g., the IndyCar Series), F1 has never awarded bonus points to drivers for leading the most laps or qualifying on pole position.

Points for shared drives were shared equally between the drivers, regardless of how many laps each driver completed. Points were shared equally between drivers who set the same fastest lap time (an extreme example of which happened in the 1954 British Grand Prix where seven drivers set the same fastest lap time, and each received 1⁄7 of a point). Points for shared drives were shared equally between the drivers, even if they drove more than one points-scoring car (e.g. 1955 Argentine Grand Prix), unless one driver was deemed to have completed "insufficient distance" (e.g. 1957 British Grand Prix). Drivers who shared more than one car in a race only received points for their highest finish (e.g. 1956 Monaco Grand Prix). Formula 2 cars raced with Formula One cars in the following Grands Prix, but were ineligible for World Championship points: 1957 German Grand Prix 1958 German Grand Prix 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix 1966 German Grand Prix 1967 German Grand Prix 1969 German Grand Prix Points were no longer awarded for shared race drives (e.g. 1958 Italian Grand Prix, 1960 Argentine Grand Prix). Only the points of the highest-scoring driver for each constructor at each race (including privateer entries) were counted towards the Constructors' Championship. The point for fastest lap was only awarded to drivers, not constructors. The points in the Indianapolis 500 were only awarded only to drivers and not constructors. Points were awarded on a 9–6–4–3–2–1 basis for the 1961 Drivers' title, and on an 8–6–4–3–2–1 basis for the 1961 Constructors' title. Drivers who were not classified (i.e. did not complete a specified amount of race distance) did not score points, even if they finished in the top six places. Second drivers of teams that officially entered only one car were not eligible for points. This affected Jo Gartner (Osella) and Gerhard Berger (ATS) who finished fifth and sixth at the 1984 Italian Grand Prix, and Yannick Dalmas (Larrousse) who finished fifth at the 1987 Australian Grand Prix. Their points were not redistributed. In 2014, double points were awarded in the last race of the season. The point for fastest lap was only awarded if the driver was classified in the top 10 in the race. No official fastest lap was awarded at the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, which was conducted entirely behind the safety car. This system was used for the sprint qualifying session at three Grands Prix, the 2021 British Grand Prix, 2021 Italian Grand Prix and 2021 São Paulo Grand Prix, which were used to determine the starting order of the main race. This system was used for the sprint races at three Grands Prix in 2022, the 2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, the 2022 Austrian Grand Prix, and the 2022 São Paulo Grand Prix to set the starting order for the main race. This system was used for the sprint races at six Grands Prix in 2023, the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix, the 2023 Belgian Grand Prix, the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix, the 2023 United States Grand Prix, and the 2023 São Paulo Grand Prix; these sprint races were a thing in itself and they no longer set the starting order for the main race. The first race for which half-points were awarded was the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix. The requirement to complete two laps is believed to have been implemented between 1977 and 1980. The regulation regarding half-points in the case of exactly two laps being completed was slightly amended in 2016; no race was affected by this amendment. In 2022, if a Grand Prix was restarted but was subsequently shortened due to reaching the regulations-imposed time limit – as had happened at the 2022 Japanese Grand Prix – then full points were awarded. Starting in 2023, the amount of points awarded is based on percentage of distance covered regardless of whether a race is ended under a red flag, or is restarted and then subsequently shortened due to reaching the regulations-imposed time limit. This change to the regulations was made in order to correct a drafting error in the 2022 regulations, which saw full points unexpectedly awarded at the 2022 Japanese Grand Prix, which only saw 28 laps completed before the time limit expired.
