Andriy Askoldovich Hrivko (Ukrainian: Андрій Аскольдович Грівко, also transliterated Hryvko or Grivko, born 7 August 1983) is a Ukrainian former racing cyclist, who rode professionally between 2005 and 2018. Since retiring from racing, Hrivko currently serves as the president of the Ukrainian Cycling Federation. Born in Zuya, Bilohirsk Raion, Hrivko competed at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in the road race, in which he did not finish, and the individual time trial, where he finished 31st. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, he only competed in the road race, finishing in 17th place. He also competed in the 2015 European Games for Ukraine in cycling. He earned a silver medal in men's road race. He competed for Ukraine in the 2016 Summer Olympics. In 2017 Hrivko was removed from the Tour of Dubai for punching Marcel Kittel in the head during the third stage of that race, prompting a query into whether or not he should be suspended and sanctioned by the UCI. After retiring from the professional peloton, Hrivko became the president of the Ukrainian Cycling Federation. 2003 8th Trofeo Internazionale Bastianelli 2004 1st Overall Giro delle Regioni 8th Time trial, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 2005 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 2nd Firenze–Pistoia 6th Rund um die Nürnberger Altstadt 2006 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 3rd Overall Critérium International 3rd GP Miguel Induráin 9th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 2007 3rd Eindhoven Team Time Trial 9th Firenze–Pistoia 2008 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Firenze–Pistoia 2nd Intaka Tech Worlds View Challenge 1 2nd Intaka Tech Worlds View Challenge 2 5th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 9th Chrono des Nations 2009 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Stage 1b (TTT) Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 2nd Overall Course de la Solidarité Olympique 3rd Gran Premio Nobili Rubinetterie 4th Overall Tour de San Luis 8th Chrono des Nations 2010 2nd Overall Three Days of De Panne 2011 6th Overall Three Days of De Panne 8th Overall Tour of Beijing 2012 National Road Championships 1st Road race 1st Time trial 5th Overall Tour of Belgium 2013 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Vuelta a España 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships 3rd Overall Eneco Tour 5th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 2014 4th Overall Eneco Tour 2015 European Games 2nd Road race 4th Time trial 6th Overall Eneco Tour 10th Overall Tour of Qatar 2016 1st Overall La Méditerranéenne 1st Stage 3 2017 10th Overall Arctic Race of Norway 2018 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 4th Overall Danmark Rundt 5th Overall Tour of Belgium 10th Overall Tour du Haut Var "Astana confirm 10 changes for 2019 roster".
