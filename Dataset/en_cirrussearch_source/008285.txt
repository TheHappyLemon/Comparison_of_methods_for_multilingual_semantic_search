Maya Moore's professional career, like her high school and college career, has been filled with championships. In her first three years, she made three WNBA finals, one Eurobasket final, and two WCBA finals, and won five of the six possible championships she could have. Along the way, she has established herself as one of the best professional women's players in the game. In 2015, she won the WNBA All-Star MVP award. This makes her one of only two players, the other being Lisa Leslie, who have won the MVP award for the WNBA regular-season, the WNBA finals, and the All-Star game. Moore was selected 1st overall in the 2011 WNBA draft by the Minnesota Lynx. She joined a team that already featured talented players like Lindsay Whalen, Rebekkah Brunson, and Seimone Augustus, and helped the Lynx to their best record in franchise history, as well as the best record in the WNBA. Moore was named WNBA Rookie of the Month for July and August, and played in the WNBA All-Star Game. Though Moore admitted that she struggled at times to adapt to the extraordinary level of talent in the WNBA, her play still earned her Rookie of the Year honors. During the playoffs, Moore was her team's second-leading scorer. She led her team in scoring once, in the final game of the Western Conference finals, when she poured in 21 points, including six three-pointers. In October 2011, Maya became only the second player in league history to win Rookie of the Year honors and a WNBA championship in the same year. In 2012, Moore helped the Lynx begin the season with a 10–0 run, the best start in WNBA history. The Lynx went on to equal 2011's 27–7 mark, finishing as the top seed in the WNBA Playoffs for a second straight year. The Lynx advanced to the 2012 WNBA Finals, for the second straight season, but fell to the Indiana Fever. In 2013, Moore elevated her game, she led the Lynx in points, and became the first player in WNBA history to lead the league in both three-point field goals and three-point shooting percentage. Moore was twice selected WNBA Western Conference Player of the Month, and three times selected WNBA Western Conference Player of the Week. Meanwhile, the Lynx once again had the best record in the WNBA, finishing 26–8. The Lynx swept through the playoffs, winning their second WNBA championship.

They played in Phoenix for the 3rd and final game, and lost 96–78, failing to make the WNBA Finals for the 1st time in 4 seasons. Prior to the 2015 season, Moore re-signed with the Lynx to a multi-year deal once her rookie contract expired. In the 2015 season, Moore was named to the 2015 WNBA All-Star Game and was awarded MVP after scoring a WNBA All-Star Game record, 30 points. Midway through the season, the Lynx had traded for Sylvia Fowles to bolster the Lynx's roster at the center position. The Lynx were first place in the Western Conference, advanced all the way to the finals and won its third WNBA championship in five years by beating the Indiana Fever, three games to two. One of the memorable highlights of the finals was in Game 3 where Moore hit a game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer. She was also named to the All-WNBA First Team in 2015. In 2016, Moore was chosen to the WNBA Top 20@20, a list of the league's best 20 players ever in celebration of the WNBA's twentieth anniversary. She was the youngest of the 20 winners. During the 2016 season, Moore averaged 19.3 points per game and the Lynx remained a potent, championship contending team, finishing with a new franchise best 28–6 record. With the WNBA's new playoff format in effect, the Lynx were the number 1 seed in the league with a double-bye to the semi-finals (the last round before the WNBA Finals) facing the Phoenix Mercury. The Lynx defeated the Mercury in a 3-game sweep, advancing to the WNBA Finals for the fifth time in six years. The Lynx were up against the Los Angeles Sparks, making it the second time in league history where two teams from the same conference faced each other in the Finals due to the new playoff format. During a loss in Game 1, Moore passed Diana Taurasi for most points scored in WNBA Finals history (262). Facing a 2–1 deficit, Moore took over in Game 4, scoring a game-high 31 points to lead the Lynx to an 85–79 win, forcing a Game 5. The Lynx would end up losing Game 5 77–76 off a game-winning shot by Nneka Ogwumike as the Sparks became 2016 WNBA Champions. In the 2017 season, Moore was voted into the 2017 WNBA All-Star Game, making it her fifth all-star game appearance. Moore won her second All-Star MVP award after scoring a team-high 23 points for the Western Conference All-Stars team in a 130–121 victory. With Fowles being the more focal point of the Lynx's offense, Moore would be the second highest scoring player on the team with 17.3 ppg. On August 12, 2017, the Lynx made history as they defeated the Indiana Fever 111–52, marking it the largest margin of victory in WNBA history, they also exploded on a league record 40–0 scoring run during the game.

On July 22, 2018, Moore scored a season-high 38 points in an 80–75 victory over the Mercury. In the 2018 season, Moore was voted into the 2018 WNBA All-Star Game and would win her third All-Star MVP award, after leading Team Parker to a 119–112 victory with 18 points. Moore led the team in scoring with 18 ppg as the Lynx finished with number 7 seed with an 18–16 record. This was first time in 8 years where the Lynx did not finish as a top 2 seed in the league. They would face off against the Los Angeles Sparks in the first round elimination game, they lost 75–68, ending their run of three consecutive finals appearances. In February 2019, Moore wrote for The Players' Tribune that she would miss the upcoming season to focus on family and ministry dreams. In January 2020, she announced that she would once again miss the upcoming WNBA season as well as the 2020 Olympic games in order to focus on her advocacy for criminal justice reform. From 2019 to 2023, Moore took a hiatus from her WNBA career to focus on reform in the American justice system. On January 16, 2023, Moore announced on Good Morning America that she was officially retiring from basketball. Moore signed with the Spanish club Ros Casares Valencia for the 2011–2012 season. She joined the team late due to her title run with the Lynx. In 10 EuroLeague Women games, Moore averaged 12.7 points, 6.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists, helping Ros Casares win its first ever EuroLeague championship on April 1, 2012. Three weeks later, Ros Casares also won the Spanish domestic league (Liga Femenina de Baloncesto) title, with Moore scoring a team-high 20 points in the April 24 final. The win over Perfumerías Avenida also revenged the March loss in the Copa de la Reina (Queen's Cup) final, when Moore scored a game-high 24. In 2012, Moore signed with the Chinese club Shanxi Flame, playing under Spanish coach Lucas Mondelo. It was the club's first year in the Women's Chinese Basketball Association, and they started the season 0–2 with American import Ebony Hoffman. As soon as Moore arrived and replaced Hoffman (since the league only allows 1 non-Asian player per team), the team won 10 in a row. In her third game, she had 60 points, 13 rebounds, 6 blocks and 5 steals against Yunnan. Moore finished her first season in Shanxi averaging 37.3 points, 12.1 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 3.5 steals per game, leading the Flame to the championship in a 3–1 series over Zhejiang. In Moore's second year with Shanxi, she again took her team to the finals, averaging 43.3 points per game in a 3–1 series win over Beijing. It was Moore's fifth professional championship in three years. For the season she averaged 39.3 points, 11.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 4.3 steals per game. In the 2014–2015 season, Shanxi won its third straight title, beating the Brittney Griner-led Beijing 3–1 in the finals after dropping the first game. She averaged 30.0 points, 9.2 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 3.6 steals per game for the season while fighting a knee injury. Despite the language barrier Moore is well-liked in Shanxi, not solely for her on-court dominance but also for her humility and friendly interactions with fans, who called her the "Invincible Queen" (不败女王). For her contributions to the city, she was awarded "Honorary Citizen of Taiyuan" by Taiyuan's municipal government. On January 2, 2018, Russian basketball club UMMC Ekaterinburg announced that Maya Moore had joined their team for the remainder of the 2017/2018 EuroLeague season. Moore would go on to average 20.6 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 5.2 assists with UMMC. UMMC would win each of their final six games of the regular season.

Moore was invited to the USA Basketball Women's National Team training camp in the fall of 2009, one of only three college players and the only junior to be invited to the training camp. The team selected to participate at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics was chosen from these players. At the conclusion of the training camp, the team traveled to Ekaterinburg, Russia, where they competed in the 2009 UMMC Ekaterinburg International Invitational. Moore was one of twenty players named to the national team pool. Twelve of this group were chosen to represent the US at the 2010 World Championships and the 2012 Olympics. The USA National team began training in April 2010 to prepare for the FIBA World Championship starting in September 2010. Moore was one of the players selected for the training sessions, run by the national team coach Geno Auriemma. The teams played informal scrimmages, with one team made up of the players expected to be on the national team, and the other team made up of invited all-star college players, referred to as the select team. Although Moore was still in college, she was invited to be part of the national team. In the first two ten-minute games, Moore played with the national team and helped them to two wins. Then Moore switched jerseys, and played for the select team. In both games, the select team won, with Moore making the assist to put the team ahead, then stealing the ball and making the game winning shot in the final seconds. Moore ended up being on the winning side in all four games. Moore was named as one of the national team members to represent the USA Basketball team in the WNBA versus USA Basketball. This game replaced the WNBA All-Star game with WNBA All-Stars versus USA Basketball, as part of the preparation for the FIBA World Championship for Women to be held in the Czech Republic during September and October 2010. Moore was selected to be a member of the National team representing the US at the World Championship. The team was coached by Geno Auriemma. Because many team members were still playing in the WNBA until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for Ostrava and Karlovy Vary. Even with limited practice, the team managed to win its first game against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring honors, with Swin Cash, Angel McCoughtry, Moore, Diana Taurasi, Lindsay Whalen, and Sylvia Fowles all ending as high scorer in the first few games. The sixth game was against undefeated Australia — the US jumped out to a 24-point lead and ultimatelynprevailed 83–75. Team USA won its next two games by over 30 points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. The US team had only a five-point lead at halftime, which was then cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer. Team USA went on to win the championship and gold medal. Moore averaged 8.7 points per game. Moore was one of 21 finalists for the 2012 U.S. Women's Olympic Basketball Team Roster. The 20 WNBA players, plus one collegiate player (Brittney Griner), were selected by the USA Basketball Women's National Team Player Selection Committee to compete for the final roster to represent the US at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Moore won a gold medal with Team USA in 2012, in doing so joining Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, Ruth Riley, Tamika Catchings and fellow UConn alums Kara Wolters, Swin Cash, Sue Bird, and Diana Taurasi on the elite list of female basketball players to have won NCAA titles, WNBA Championships and Olympic gold medals. Moore was one of 33 finalists for the U.S. Women's FIBA World Championship roster. The 32 WNBA players, plus one collegiate player (Breanna Stewart), were selected by the USA Basketball Women's National Team Player Selection Committee to compete for the final roster to represent the US at the FIBA World Championship for Women in Turkey during September and October 2014. Moore made the final roster of 12 players, announced on September 23, 2014. Moore won the gold medal with the team in 2014, having now won 3 gold medals with the U.S. team. She was named to the all-tournament team and won the tournament MVP award. USA Basketball named Moore to the squad that would play at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which would be her second Olympic tournament. Moore earned her second gold medal, helping the US overcome Spain 101–72 in the final. Over four seasons, Moore played in 128 games and averaged 19.3 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 3.5 steals per game. Source On July 9, 2016, Moore spoke along with co-captain Rebekkah Brunson at a news conference about the warm up shirts the Minnesota Lynx wore that day to highlight Black Lives Matter and call for change. The black shirts said "Change starts with us - Justice and Accountability" on the front; the back of the shirts had the names of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, who had been murdered by police that week. The shirts also included the Dallas police shield to recognize the recent shooting in that Texas city where five police officers were killed. The Lynx shirts and news conference were an early Black Lives Matter protest among athletes. In 2017, Moore started Win with Justice to advocate for prosecutorial reform. Writers Chris Herring and Neil Paine recounted her amazing basketball record through her departure from basketball in 2019 and noted that "Moore is special because she could have gone about her business as one of the best players in WNBA history, but instead she chose to lend her voice and platform to victims of injustice." They noted her place as one of the top civil rights voices among athletes. In July 2021, ESPN Films released Breakaway about Moore and her social justice advocacy as part of their 30 for 30 series. Robin Roberts was the executive producer of the film. Moore won the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage in 2021 for her work on criminal justice reform. Moore is also an advocate for the End it Movement which seeks to end slavery in modern times. Moore is a Christian. Moore has spoken about her faith, saying "Even though I've got a lot of awards and honors, it's nothing compared to what The Lord has done to my heart and what He's done for the world" and "I'm grateful to have the platform of an elite student-athlete and professional basketball player, and I want to do His will with my life." Influenced by her godparents, Moore advocates for prosecutorial reform in the American justice system. Specifically, she pressed for the release of Jonathan Irons from the Jefferson City correctional center. Irons was serving a 50-year sentence begun when he was 16 years old. Moore took a sabbatical from basketball in 2019 and 2020, hoping to secure his release. Irons was released July 1, 2020. In September 2020, Moore told Good Morning America that she and Irons had gotten married "a couple of months ago". On July 5, 2022, Moore announced the birth of their first child, a son named Jonathan Irons Jr. In 2023, the two published a book, Love and Justice: A Story of Triumph on Two Different Courts. Moore was the subject of an ESPN Sports Science video clip, discussing her vertical leap, court vision, and muscle memory. They discussed her ability to steal, noting that she can move her hands faster than the striking speed of a rattlesnake. On October 28, 2013, Moore was featured as Betty Lou in the Pepsi Max series of advertisements written and directed by Kyrie Irving, becoming the first WNBA player to be a part of the series. In the "Uncle Drew: Chapter 3" spot, Betty Lou, 'Lights' (Nate Robinson), and 'Uncle Drew' (Irving) hustle a courtyard of young players at Seward Park in Chicago, Illinois. Moore was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30: The Sports World's Brightest Young Stars for 2015. In November 2016, Moore joined the UNICEF Kid Power philanthropic initiative, participating as one of the UNICEF Kid Power Champions; Moore joined a mission to Haiti that year. Moore's father, Mike Dabney, who was not part of her life growing up, played collegiate basketball for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights men's basketball team that reached the Final Four at the 1976 NCAA Division I basketball tournament. He was chosen 36th overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the third round of the 1976 NBA draft, though he did not play in the NBA. Through her father, Moore has a half-sister, Ashley Dabney, who was a college senior and track and field athlete at Maryland's Towson University in 2012. Also through her father, Moore has a ten-years younger half-sister, Olivia Dabney, who was a high school basketball player and All-Sophomore/Freshman First Team selection at New Jersey's Rutgers Preparatory School, and went on to play four years with the Division I Sacred Heart Pioneers. She was named to the U.S. U-18 National Team in 2006, and helped that team qualify for the 2007 U19 World Championships in Bratislava, Slovakia. In 2008, she became the first freshman in Big East Basketball history (men or women) to be named as the Big East Player of the Year. Through Moore's two seasons at UConn, Moore had only three games where she did not reach double digits. Those games are a 7-point performance vs. Pittsburgh on March 10, 2008, 7 points vs. Rutgers on April 1, 2008, and 8 points vs. Villanova on February 24, 2009. Moore also broke the UConn single-season record for most points as a freshman (678) breaking the mark set by Svetlana Abrosimova, who had 538 in 1997–98. Scored her 1,000th career point on January 20, 2009 (in just her 55th game at UConn) at the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut while scoring 40 points over the Syracuse Orange. The previous UConn record for the fewest games needed to reach 1,000 points was 63 by Svetlana Abrosimova. Maya Moore becomes UConn's all-time single-season scoring leader with 712 points, ends season with 754 points Moore finished the 2009–10 season with 736 points, the second most points scored in a season by a UConn player only to herself (754 pts in 2008–09). In addition, this brings her career total to 2,168 points, 178 short of the UConn record of 2,346 points held by her teammate Tina Charles. Moore was named the co-winner of the Honda-Broderick Cup (along with Megan Hodge from Penn State), awarded to the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year. The criteria include "outstanding athletic achievement but also team contributions, scholastics and community involvement". Moore won the 2010 ESPY Award for Best Female College Athlete. Moore was selected to play in a basketball game organized by President Barack Obama to entertain wounded troops. The players invited included some current and former stars: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Bill Russell and Magic Johnson. Moore scored a career-high 41 points while adding 10 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steal, and 3 blocks in UConn's historic 89th consecutive victory on December 21, 2010, against 22/22 Florida State. In March 2011, Moore earned All-American honors, becoming the second four-time All-American women's basketball player. In April 2011, Moore was named Associated Press Player of the Year for the second time. Moore was selected Best Female Amateur Athlete by Connecticut Magazine for 2010 Won a gold medal with Team USA in the London Olympics Over the course of her career, Moore has been invited to receive honors at the White House five times, prompting President Obama to joke that "basically, there's like a Maya Moore wing in the White House."
