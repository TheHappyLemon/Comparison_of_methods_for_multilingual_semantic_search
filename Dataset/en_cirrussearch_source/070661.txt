The Cathedral Church of Our Lady of Sorrows, also known as St Mary's Cathedral or Wrexham Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Wrexham, Wales. It is the seat of the Bishop of Wrexham, and mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wrexham (founded in 1987). The cathedral was originally built as a parish church in 1857. Its architect, Edward Welby Pugin, adopted a 14th-century Decorated Gothic style. The church replaced an earlier chapel, located in King Street, which by the 1850s was deemed insufficient for the growing congregation, and finance was provided by a local industrialist. Further additions to satisfy a still-growing congregation were made in the mid-20th century, in the form of the cloister and side chapel. The church was designated a pro-cathedral in 1898 upon the establishment of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Menevia. It was consecrated on 7 November 1907.
