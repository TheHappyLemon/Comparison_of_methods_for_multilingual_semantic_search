It was organized into a city and thirteen parishes, each with a local government authority. The main city in the district was Gulbene. In Gulbene, a Baltic single passage narrow-gauge railroad, Gulbene-Aluksne, was renovated and started to operate in 2005. Gulbene has a basketball team, ASK/Buki-Gulbene. Districts were eliminated during the administrative-territorial reform in 2009.
