The New Orleans Hornets officially renamed their franchise to New Orleans Pelicans to begin the 2013–14 season. The Charlotte Bobcats officially announced that the franchise would be renamed to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15 season. This will return the Hornets name to Charlotte for the first time since the team now known as the Pelicans moved from Charlotte to New Orleans after the 2001–02 season. The Cleveland Cavaliers win the #1 pick in the NBA draft for the second time in three years, as well as the fifth time in franchise history (1971, 1986, 2003, and 2011 were the previous four times), and selected Canadian forward Anthony Bennett of UNLV.

The Portland Trail Blazers officially announced that the Rose Garden would be renamed to the Moda Center before the start of the season. The NBA Finals will return to the 2–2–1–1–1 format for the 2014 Finals, with the owners approving the format on October 23. The NBA originally decided to have the NBA Finals enter a 2–3–2 format starting in the 1985 NBA Finals in order to accommodate commercial travelling from the east to the west and vice versa, as well as bring up economic advantages for marketing and newspapers at the time. The NBA experiments with on-court advertising beginning this season. The Indiana Pacers court at Bankers Life Fieldhouse will be sponsored by the Indiana Economic Development Corporation with the slogan A State That Works. The Toronto Raptors court at Air Canada Centre will be sponsored by the Bank of Montreal, while the New York Knicks court at Madison Square Garden will be sponsored by Chase.

On January 11, 2014, the Philadelphia 76ers' Wells Fargo Center added PartyPoker.com as its on-court sponsor. On October 29, the regular season opened with a record of 92 international players on the opening night rosters. The San Antonio Spurs set an NBA record of 10 international players. The Brooklyn Nets start out their season with Joe Prunty coaching their games against the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat instead of their original head coach Jason Kidd. The reason why Prunty was coaching at the start of the Nets' season instead of Kidd was due to Kidd serving a coaching suspension for having a DUI in July 2013. Prunty would start the year off with 1–1 for the Nets before Kidd came back and coached the team for the rest of the season. Patrick Ewing coaches his first game ever as an interim head coach for the Charlotte Bobcats. He ended up coaching the Bobcats on November 8, 2013, against his former team, the New York Knicks, due to their coach Steve Clifford having heart surgery around that time period. He would end up losing that game 101–91. In a double overtime game on December 3, 2013, rookies Victor Oladipo of the Orlando Magic and Michael Carter-Williams of the Philadelphia 76ers recorded triple-doubles in the same game. Oladipo recorded 26 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in 52 minutes, while Carter-Williams recorded 27 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in 47 minutes. These were the first career triple-doubles for both players. This marked the first and only time in NBA history that two rookies have recorded triple-doubles in the same game. The last time that two players had recorded their first career triple-doubles in the same game was when Detroit Pistons Donnie Butcher and Ray Scott did it on March 14, 1964 (they were not rookies). It was also the first time that two opponents had recorded triple-doubles in the same game since Caron Butler and Baron Davis had done so on November 23, 2007. Philadelphia won the game 126–125. The planned regular season game in Mexico City between the San Antonio Spurs and Minnesota Timberwolves on December 4 was postponed after a generator malfunction inside the Mexico City Arena. The rescheduled game was played on April 8, 2014, at Target Center in Minneapolis. On December 6, 2013, Kyle Korver of the Atlanta Hawks set a new NBA record for most consecutive (regular season) games with a three-point field goal made with 90. The previous record holder was Dana Barros. The streak ended at 127.

On December 13, 2013, Kevin Garnett of the Brooklyn Nets surpassed 14,000 career rebounds, becoming only the tenth player in NBA history to do so. In reaching the milestone, Garnett also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone as the only players to reach 25,000 points, 14,000 rebounds and 5,000 assists. He reached the milestone in the third quarter of a 99–103 road loss to the Detroit Pistons. On December 16, 2013, Joe Johnson of the Brooklyn Nets scored 29 points in the third quarter of a 130–94 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.

The win was also the largest margin of victory in a Christmas Day game in NBA history. On December 27, 2013, LeBron James of the Miami Heat passed Larry Bird and Gary Payton for 29th on the NBA's all-time scoring list. James did so in a 108–103 loss versus the Sacramento Kings. On January 16, 2014, the Houston Rockets scored a season-high 73 points in the first half, and a season-low 19 points in the second half.

Ross recorded the lowest season scoring average the year of a 50-point game, averaging only 10.9 points. On January 31, 2014, the Brooklyn Nets recorded an all-time low of 17 rebounds in a 125–90 blowout loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. This broke a record low of 18 rebounds that was originally recorded by the Detroit Pistons in a November 28, 2001 game against the Charlotte Hornets. David Stern officially retires as commissioner of the NBA on February 1, 2014. Adam Silver would end up taking his place as commissioner in the process, with Mark Tatum taking on the role of deputy commissioner in the process. The New Orleans Arena that the New Orleans Pelicans played under was re-branded as the Smoothie King Center on February 5, 2014. Therefore, while some of the earlier games played in New Orleans were under the New Orleans Arena name, further home Pelicans games, as well as the All-Star break that happened from February 14–16, 2014, will end up being mentioned as the Smoothie King Center from now until at least 10 more NBA seasons. On February 23, Jason Collins signed a 10-day contract with the Brooklyn Nets, becoming the first openly gay athlete in North America's four major professional sports. On March 3, LeBron James scored a career-high 61 points against the Charlotte Bobcats. His 61 points was also a franchise-high.

He also joined Allen Iverson, Michael Jordan & Rick Barry as only players with 50 points & 6 steals in a game. The San Antonio Spurs won their franchise-record 18th straight win against the Indiana Pacers. The Spurs also finished March with a 16–0 record, the second time in franchise history that they recorded a perfect month going back to the 1995–96 NBA season during the same month. The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers failed to qualify for the playoffs. This marked the first time in 20 seasons that both teams missed the playoffs in the same season. For the Lakers, it marked the first time in nine seasons that they missed the playoffs. With the New York Knicks also missing the playoffs, this marked the first time in NBA history that none of the three teams qualified for the playoffs. On April 25, 2014, TMZ leaked an audio recording of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling allegedly making racist comments to his girlfriend, causing the NBA to launch an investigation. The team held a meeting the following day to discuss the incident. Both coaches and players reportedly expressed anger toward the comment and they briefly raised the possibility of boycotting Game 4 of their series against the Golden State Warriors before deciding against it. On April 29, 2014, Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life as well as fining him $2.5 million. Silver also began proceeding of forcing Sterling out of the league.
