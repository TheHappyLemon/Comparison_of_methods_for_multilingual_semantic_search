Liverpool Fútbol Club is a Uruguayan professional football club based in Montevideo. The team was first promoted to the Primera División in 1919 and plays its home games at Estadio Belvedere. The club has its roots in the student team from the Catholic Capuchin school in Nuevo París, which began playing in 1908. The club took on the name Liverpool as there were many cultural links between the two areas; the majority of coal ships arriving in Montevideo came from the English port. A number of clubs took on Anglicised names, such as league rivals Montevideo Wanderers. Liverpool plays home matches in Estadio Belvedere (Belvedere Stadium), formerly owned by the Montevideo Wanderers. In 2023 Liverpool won the Primera División for the first time. They filled one of the final slots as they had the highest overall point tally during the entire season, while also filling one of the semi-final slots, as they had won the Clausura that year as well. They lost to Peñarol in the semi-finals 1–0 in extra time, due to a 119th minute goal by former Uruguay international Abel Hernández. In the finals, however, things played out differently. Liverpool won 3–0 on aggregate, recording a 2–0 win at home, and a 1-0 win during the return leg. This triumph marked the first since the 2013–14 season that a club besides Club Nacional de Football or Peñarol won the Primera División. This was also the first time that a Uruguayan club won its first Primera División title since 1990. Source: Liverpool (Montevideo) Page – BDFA.com.ar As of 17 February, 2024.
