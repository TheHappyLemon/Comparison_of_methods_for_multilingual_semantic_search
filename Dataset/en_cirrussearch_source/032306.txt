Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. South Africa accepted the convention on 10 July 1997. There are ten World Heritage Sites in South Africa, with a further two on the tentative list. The first three sites in South Africa were added to the list in 1999 while the most recent one, the Barberton Makhonjwa Mountains, was added in 2018. Five sites are listed for their cultural significance, four for natural, and one site, the Maloti-Drakensberg Park, is listed for both. This site is transnational as it is shared with Lesotho. South Africa has served as a member of the World Heritage Committee three times: 1999–2005, 2009–2013, and 2019–2023. UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.   * Transnational site In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. South Africa maintains two properties on its tentative list.
