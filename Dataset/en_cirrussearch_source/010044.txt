Dmitrijs Miļkevičs (born 6 December 1981 in Riga) is a former Latvian track athlete who competed in 400 metres and 800 metres. Miļkevičs ran a career-best 46.44 in the 400 metres at the 2003 European Athletics U23 Championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland. He has won an NCAA championship while competing for the University of Nebraska. In the 2004 Summer Olympics, he was 14th in the 800 metres. In 2006, he set the Latvian record in the 800 metres with a time of 1:43.67, a record which still stands. After Miļkevičs found out that, due to lack of funds, the Latvian Athletics Union wouldn't able to pay for Latvian delegation's start at the 2010 European Athletics Championships, he decided not to compete. 400 m Indoor - 47.61 (2002) Outdoor - 46.44 (2003) 600 y Indoor - 1:08.67 (2004) 600 m Indoor - 1:15.60 (2005) 800 m Indoor - 1:45.72 (2008) Outdoor - 1:43.67 (2006) 1000 m Indoor - 2:22.82 (2005) 2002 European Indoor Championships - Vienna, Austria 400 m, 19th, (47.61 seconds), PB European Championships in Athletics - Munich, Germany 400 m, 23rd, (46.87 seconds) 2003 European Athletics U23 Championships - Bydgoszcz, Poland 400 m, (46.44 seconds) PB 2004 Big 12 Conference Indoor championships - United States 800 m, 1st, (1:48.82) NCAA Indoor Championships - United States 800 m, 6th, (1:48.97) Big 12 Conference Outdoor Championships - United States 800 m, 2nd, (1:48.07) NCAA Outdoor Championships - United States 800 m, 6th, (1:47.51) Summer Olympic Games - Athens, Greece 800 m, 14th, (1:46.62) 2005 European Indoor Championships - Madrid, Spain 800 m, 14th, (1:51.61) Big 12 Conference Outdoor Championships - United States 800 m, 2nd, (1:45.10) NCAA Outdoor Championships - United States 800 m, 1st, (1:44.74) PB World Championships in Athletics - Helsinki, Finland 800 m, 42nd, (1:50.44) 2006 World Indoor Championships - Moscow, Russia 800 m 4th, (1:48.01) European Athletics Championships - Gothenburg, Sweden 800 m, 4th, (1:46.70) Dmitrijs Miļkevičs at World Athletics Dmitrijs Miļkevičs Archived 12 July 2011 at the Wayback Machine at University of Nebraska Dmitrijs Miļkevičs at Olympedia Dmitrijs Miļkevičs at Olympics.com Dmitrijs Miļkevičs at Olympic.org (archived) Dmitrijs Miļkevičs at the Latvijas Olimpiskā komiteja (in Latvian) (English translation, archive) v t e
