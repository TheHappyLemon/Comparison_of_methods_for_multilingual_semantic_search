"Julia Dream" is a song by the English rock band Pink Floyd and the B-side of the single "It Would Be So Nice". The song was the first to be released by the band with lead vocals by David Gilmour. Written by bassist Roger Waters, "Julia Dream" is characterised by the slow tempo, the airy, ambient Mellotron sounds from keyboardist Richard Wright and lush chorus vocals. The song's lyrics include reference to an eiderdown, an item also mentioned in two other known Pink Floyd songs – Syd Barrett's "Flaming" and Gilmour/Waters's "A Pillow of Winds". The phrase "Am I really dying" will reappear in the version of the song "Mother" re-recorded for the film "Pink Floyd – The Wall". David Gilmour's lead vocal is double tracked. The song was later included on several compilation albums: The Early Years 1965–1972 box, The Best of the Pink Floyd, Relics, and The Early Singles disc, which was included in the Shine On box set.
