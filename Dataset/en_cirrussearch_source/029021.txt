The Bezirk Dresden was a district (Bezirk) of East Germany that lasted from 1952 to 1990. Dresden would be reabsorbed back into Saxony after the reunification of Germany. The administrative seat and the main town was Dresden. The district was established, with the other 13, on 25 July 1952, substituting the old German states. After 3 October 1990 it was disestablished upon German reunification, becoming again part of the state of Saxony. The Bezirk Dresden was the easternmost Bezirk of East Germany. It, bordered on the 'Bezirke' of Cottbus, Leipzig and Karl-Marx-Stadt, as well as on Czechoslovakia and Poland. It was broadly similar in area to the later Direktionsbezirk Dresden, which functioned from 1990 to 2012.
