The first written mention of Lanškroun is from 1285, when it was donated by King Wenceslaus II to Záviš of Falkenstein. Lanškroun was founded during the colonization in the second half of the 13th century under the name Landeskrone. It became the economical centre of the large estate of Lanšperk and later of separate Lanškroun estate. In 1304, Lanškroun property of the Zbraslav Monastery and in 1358, it was acquired by Roman Catholic Diocese of Leitomischl. In 1371, an Augustinian monastery was founded. In 1421, the town was conquered by Jan Žižka. After the Hussite Wars, the estate was acquired by the noble family of Kostka of Postupice. It began to prosper and obtained various privileges. In 1507, it was bought by the Pernštejn family. Then it was shortly held by the Hrzáns of Harasov, and after the Battle of White Mountain, it was bought by the Liechtenstein family. During the Thirty Years' War, the town was repeatedly burned down and looted by the Swedish army and the catholicization began. After the war, the population was significantly decreased. It was repopulated by German settlers and in 1683, German has become the official language. During the 18th century, Lanškroun was an average serf town. In 1848, the serfdom was abolished and Lanškroun became a district town. In the 1870s, the industrialization began. The railway was built in 1884–1885. Until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary as the seat of the district Landskron in Bömen, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia. After 1919 it became part of Czechoslovakia. In 1938 it was occupied by German troops according to the Munich Agreement. Since 1939 it was part of the newly formed Reichsgau Sudetenland and seat of the Landkreis Landskron. Shortly after the end of World War II, on May 17, 1945, the Massacre in Lanškroun (German: Landskron) happened. Czech partisans drove all the Germans into the market square. A large table was set up on the sidewalk in front of the district office. The so-called People's Court took its place there. Those who had been singled out as guilty had to appear before the judge's table after being forced to slide on their knees for the last twenty steps. The sentences were either corporal punishment or death by shooting or hanging. Since the sentences were carried out almost immediately, these events are also called the Landskron Blood Court. Until the expulsion of the German speaking population from Lanškroun in 1946, the majority of population of the town had been German. After the expulsion, the town became completely Czech. In 1945, it ceased to be a district town. Lanškroun is an industrial town. The most important sectors are the electronics industry, engineering and paper industry.
