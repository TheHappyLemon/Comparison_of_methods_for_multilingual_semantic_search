Dominik Kubalík (born 21 August 1995) is a Czech professional ice hockey forward for the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted in the seventh round, 191st overall, by the Los Angeles Kings in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. Kubalík spent the 2012–13 season with the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). After scoring 34 points in 67 games, he was selected in the seventh round (191st overall) by the Los Angeles Kings in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. Kubalík returned to the Wolves for the 2013–14 season. On 10 January 2014, Kubalík (along with two second-round draft picks) was traded to the Kitchener Rangers in exchange for Radek Faksa. On 8 April 2014, Kubalík returned to HC Plzeň on a two-year contract. On 25 August 2017, Kubalík signed a three-year contract with HC Ambrì-Piotta of the National League (NL). He split the 2017–18 season between HC Ambrì-Piotta and HC Plzeň (while on loan). On 24 January 2019, Kubalík's NHL rights were traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for a 2019 fifth-round pick. He finished the 2018–19 season with 57 points in 50 games, and was named the Switzerland Hockey National League's most valuable player. On 29 May 2019, the Blackhawks signed Kubalík to a one-year, $925,000 contract. On 10 October 2019, Kubalík scored his first career NHL goal in a 5–4 loss to the San Jose Sharks. In his first season he played on a line with Jonathan Toews and Brandon Saad. On 27 February 2020, Kubalík recorded his first career NHL hat-trick in a 5–2 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning. All 3 of Kubalík's goals came in the third period. He finished the regular season with 30 goals and 16 assists for 46 points in 68 games. On 15 July 2020, Kubalík was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy (alongside Quinn Hughes and Cale Makar), which is awarded to the league's best first-year player. He was named to the NHL's All-Rookie Team. The Blackhawks met the Edmonton Oilers in the 2020 Qualifying Round. In Game 1 of the series, Kubalík recorded 2 goals and 3 assists in a 6–4 win. His 5 points were the most scored in an NHL postseason debut in league history. Kubalík also scored the game winner in Game 4 to eliminate the Oilers. In the following series versus the top-seeded Vegas Golden Knights, Kubalík was held to just two points as the Blackhawks were eliminated in five games. Following that first season, Kubalík's production declined as Saad left the team, and Toews missed the season. His second season was marked with only 17 goals and then his final season in Chicago, 15 goals. As an impending restricted free agent following the conclusion of his contract on completion of the 2021–22 season, Kubalík was not tendered a qualifying offer by the rebuilding Blackhawks, and was released to free agency on 12 July 2022. On the opening day of free agency on 13 July, Kubalík signed a two-year, $5 million contract with the Detroit Red Wings. Kubalík hoped for a fresh start with the Red Wings, after struggling in his final year with the Blackhawks. In his first season with the Red Wings, Kubalík registered 20 goals and 45 points in 81 games. He scored against his former team, the Blackhawks, on 9 March 2023 in a 4–3 win. On 9 July 2023 Kubalík was traded to the Ottawa Senators, along with Donovan Sebrango, a conditional first-round pick in 2024 and a fourth-round pick in 2024, in exchange for Alex DeBrincat. Kubalík's older brother, Tomáš, was a fifth-round draft pick by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, and played 12 games for the organization. He most recently played in the Czech Extraliga. Leeson, Brad (1 July 2013). "Kings crown Kubalik". The Sudbury Star. Retrieved 6 August 2023.
