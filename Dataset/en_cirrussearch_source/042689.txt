Erjon Bogdani (born 14 April 1977) is an Albanian professional football coach and former player. He is nicknamed "Bogu" or "Er-Bomber". Regarded as one of the most successful Albanian players of all time, Bogdani began his career at Partizani Tirana in 1994 where he debuted at the age of 16. He left the club in January 1998 to sign with Gençlerbirliği. That summer, Bogdani moved in Croatia to play for Zagreb, before traveling to Italy where he enjoyed the best years of his career. Bogdani played in the following years in Serie A and B, representing Reggina, Salernitana, Verona, Siena, Chievo, Livorno and Cesena. He became a free agent in May 2013 after his contract with Siena ran out, and retired from the sport in February 2014. Bogdani has 74 caps for Albania national team, making his debut in 1996 and scoring his first goal three years later. With 18 goals, he is Albania's all-time top goalscorer, overtaking his former teammate Alban Bushi in 2011 by netting his 15th goal. He holds numerous Albanian records, including most goals as substitute and oldest goalscoring in history, and has been dubbed as the best striker to play for the Red and Black.

Overall he made 7 official appearances and scored 1 goal as Albania finished Group 9 in 5th place. Under-23 Bogdani was called up to Albania under-23 by coach Sulejman Mema to participate in the 1997 Mediterranean Games football tournament, which began on 8 June in Southern Italy. Albania U23 were shorted in Group B among Yugoslavia and Italy.

Bogdani didn't find more space in the next qualifying campaign, the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification, in which he managed to play only four matches. He was not seen as starter by manager Medin Zhega before players such as Igli Tare, Alban Bushi and Altin Rraklli. He scored his next international goals in form of a brace in the 3–0 home win over Malta on 15 November 2000. Bogdani missed out almost the entire UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying due to injury suffered at club level, participating only one time on 7 June 2003 against Republic of Ireland where he was an unused substitute under coach Hans-Peter Briegel. Having been out of the team for more than 18 months, Bogdani returned in February 2005 for the matchday 5 of 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign against Ukraine in which he appeared as a second-half substitute for fellow striker Tare. Then he was put as starter in the next matches after a good run on club level, notably scoring in the loss to Denmark and win versus Kazakhstan. Then he scored a brace in the 2–2 draw versus Ukraine in the penultimate qualifying match which gave him four for the campaign, making him top goalscorer of the team, as Albania finished Group 2 at 5th place, leaving behind Georgia and Kazakhstan. Bogdani continued to lead Albania's attacking force in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying, playing 11 matches, all of them as starter, and was along with Altin Haxhi the most used player. He scored only once during the qualifiers, the temporary equalizer in an eventual 4–2 home defeat to Belarus on 17 November 2007 in the penultimate matchday of Group G. Albania failed once again to qualify at a major tournament as they finished Group G in 5th position with 11 points from 12 matches. Bogdani played his first 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match by scoring the opener against Malta, his 9th international goal, in an eventual 3–0 win at Qemal Stafa Stadium in the second match of Group 1. Later on 6 June 2009, Bogdani scored his 10th international goal against Portugal, becoming only the fifth player to achieve the feat. His goal however was only the temporary equalizer the minute after Portugal's opener, as Albania lost 1–2 at injury time. Bogdani made his 50th international appearance in the friendly versus Cyprus in August 2009, netting the third goal in a 6–1 home win which was Albania's largest ever victory. With this goal he overtook Igli Tare and Sokol Kushta to become Albania's 4th goalscorer of all time. Bogdani scored his next goal in the next qualifying match against Denmark to give Albania a 1–1 draw. It was the first time that Bogdani had scored in three consecutive matches. Albania finished Group 1 in 5th place with only 7 points and 6 goals scored, with Bogdani netting half of them. Bogdani began his UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying by playing as a starter in the opening Group D match versus Romania as Albania drew 1–1 at Stadionul Ceahlăul. It was also Albania's first draw versus Tricolorii since 1949 after 9 consecutive defeats. On 9 February 2011, Bogdani played in the 1–2 friendly loss to Slovenia, entering in Albania's top 10 appearance maker list. Later on 26 March 2011, Bogdani assisted Hamdi Salihi's winner against Belarus with a header to give Albania the 1–0 win at Qemal Stafa Stadium, the first ever against them. It was also Bogdani's 60 international appearance, overtaking Rudi Vata in the process. Bogdani scored his first goal in the qualifiers on 2 September 2011 against the FIFA World Cup-winners France. With this goal Bogdani leveled Alban Bushi to become joint all-time top goalscorer of Albania with 14 goals. He broke the record four days later in the next qualifying match, a 2–1 away loss versus Luxembourg. In the post-match interview, Bogdani stated that he was considering retirement from the national team but changed his mind following a conversation with the Albanian Football Association president Armand Duka declaring that he will stay for another qualification campaign if the Albania national team needs him and of course if he would be in a good running form. He also described 2011 as one of the best years of his career. Now a veteran, Bogdani continued to be a part of the national team even after the appointment of manager Gianni De Biasi, who was known for having a liking for youth players. He scored his first goal under De Biasi on 22 May 2012, his 16th with a penalty, in a 2–1 friendly win over Qatar at Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas. For the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, De Biasi had introduced young forwards into the team to create more competition for the starting eleven. Young forwards such as Edgar Çani, Armando Sadiku and Bekim Balaj provided competition for the established and mature internationals which were Bogdani and Hamdi Salihi. He played as a substitute in the opening Group E match versus Cyprus, entering at 72nd minute in place of Emiljano Vila, only to fire a 30-yard strike into the net in the 87th minute to secure a 3–1 win, a goal which many considered to be the best international goal of his career. It was his 69th match for Albania, which made him the fifth player with most appearances, overtaking Igli Tare and Alban Bushi. He started in the second match against Switzerland but was replaced in the 55th minute as Albania lost 0–2.

Bogdani captained Albania for the first time in his career four days later in the friendly match against Lithuania in his 74th international appearance, playing for 70 minutes before making place for Lorik Cana. On 11 February 2014, Bogdani confirmed to have retired from the played football, thus ending his 17-year international career. At the time, he was Albania's fourth player with most appearances. He is currently the top goalscorer with 18 goals. He also hold records for most goals scored for Albania at FIFA World Cup qualification (8), and most goals scored as a substitute (4).
