The Russian Empire competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. It was the first appearance of the European nation, which had entered the names of competitors for the first modern Olympics in 1896 but had failed to appear. The Russian team had two riders in the initial Olympic equestrian competitions. Both men competed in the long jump and in the mail coach and de Polyakov competed in the hacks and hunter combined event. One of the two competed in the high jump, though it is not clear which. Similarly, it is not clear which of the two men entered the jumping competition; further, for this event, it is not clear whether the Russian entrant actually competed. Russia competed in fencing in the nation's first Olympic appearance. The nation sent 3 fencers; all were sabre professionals. Only two competed. Either Orloff or de Poliakov entered, and is assumed to have competed. No record exists of which it was, and the official report indicates numbers of entrants per nation rather than competitors. Since not all entrants competed, it is uncertain if a Russian actually competed. Again, this was either Orloff or de Poliakov. De Wael indicates that all entrants competed in this event, so whichever Russian entered did compete. Official report 1900 Page 165 Russia Fencing at the 1900 Paris Summer Games De Wael, Herman.
