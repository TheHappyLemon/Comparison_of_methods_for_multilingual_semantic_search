Anna Kiesenhofer (born 14 February 1991) is an Austrian professional cyclist and mathematician, who rides for UCI Women's WorldTeam Roland Cycling. She is currently a postdoctoral fellow in mathematics at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). Kiesenhofer gained fame when she won the gold medal in the women's individual road race at the 2020 Summer Olympics, the first Summer Olympics gold medal for Austria since 2004 and their first cycling Olympic gold medal since 1896. Unfancied for a medal pre-race, she attacked in the first seconds of the event and soloed to victory, her pursuers mistakenly unaware of her position, in a win described as "one of the greatest upsets in Olympics and cycling history". Kiesenhofer studied mathematics at the Vienna University of Technology (2008–11), completing her Master's degree at the Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge (2011–12). She earned her PhD at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia with her thesis on Integrable systems on b-symplectic manifolds in 2016. Kiesenhofer was a postdoctoral researcher at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and was part of a group researching nonlinear partial differential equations which arise in mathematical physics. Kiesenhofer has authored several scholarly journal articles including: Braddell, R., Kiesenhofer, A., & Miranda, E.

After an injury, she had to limit her running and therefore concentrated on cycling from 2014. She joined the Catalan team Frigoríficos Costa Brava – Naturalium. In 2015, she participated in cyclo-sports, including the Gran Fondo New York, which ends at Mont Ventoux and won. She entered the Tour de l'Ardèche but she was the victim of a fall on the first stage. She failed to recover and after several difficult stages decided to withdraw. In 2016, she won the Coupe d'Espagne. In September, she took part in the Tour de l'Ardèche in the international team. On the third stage, the first breakaway started at the 12th kilometer. It was composed of Dani Christmas, Anna Plichta, Sara Olsson, Vita Heine and Silvia Valsecchi. Twenty kilometers away, they were joined by Kiesenhofer. In the descent of the pass of Murs, the groups were seven minutes and twenty-five seconds ahead. After Blavac, Anna Plichta went off alone and she had a lead of a minute thirty at the foot of Mont Ventoux. On the ascent, Kiesenhofer joined her. She won the stage by almost four minutes over Flávia Oliveira and she took the lead in the overall standings. The next day, Flávia Oliveira escaped in turn and she took Kiesenhofer's pink jersey. She kept her second place in the overall standings until the end of the race. In July 2021, as Austria's sole representative in the 137 km-long Olympic women's road race in Tokyo, Japan, she won the gold medal, crossing the finish line 75 seconds in front of Annemiek van Vleuten of the Netherlands. Kiesenhofer trained for the event without a coach or a professional team, and was not viewed as a contender to win a medal. In the race, she initiated a breakaway from the start, and was joined by four other competitors. With 86 km to go, the leading group, now down to Kiesenhofer, Omer Shapira, and Anna Plichta, formed a 10-minute advantage over the chasing peloton. Kiesenhofer broke away by herself for the final 41 km while climbing the Kagosaka Pass, dropping Shapira and Plichta, who were later caught by the peloton. Many in the peloton, including silver medalist Van Vleuten who celebrated mistakenly thinking she had won the gold, finished the race unaware that Kiesenhofer was still in front of them. Kiesenhofer later said she "couldn't believe" she won adding that she would have been happy with a top 25 finish. After racing as a privateer in 2022, Kiesenhofer joined the Israel Premier Tech Roland team for the 2023 season. 2015 1st Overall Semaine Cantalienne 1st Stages 2 & 6 2016 2nd Overall Tour Cycliste Féminin International de l'Ardèche 1st Stage 3 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships Copa de España 2nd Gran Premio Comunidad de Cantabria 2nd Trofeo Zamora 4th Trofeo Gobierno de La Rioja 5th Zizurkil-Villabona 7th Trofeo Ria de Marin 10th Trofeo Bicicletas Jonny 2018 5th Thun-West Time trial 2019 National Road Championships 1st Time trial 1st Road race 4th Thun-West Time trial 5th Ljubljana–Domžale–Ljubljana TT 5th Time trial, European Road Championships 8th Chrono des Nations 2020 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Hochkar Bergeinzelzeitfahren Time trial 3rd Overall Tour Cycliste Féminin International de l'Ardèche 2021 1st Road race, Olympic Games 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 2nd Chrono des Nations 7th Time trial, UEC European Road Championships 2022 National Road Championships 2nd Time trial 2nd Road race 5th Time trial, UEC European Road Championships 10th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 2023 National Road Championships 1st Time trial 5th Road race 1st Chrono des Nations 1st Chrono Féminin de la Gatineau 1st Chrono de la Sionge 3rd Championnats d'Europe des Grimpeurs 6th Time trial, UEC European Road Championships 2024 3rd Grand Prix MOPT Kiesenhofer was awarded the Niki prize as Sportlerin des Jahres 2021 (Sportswoman of the Year) by Sports Media Austria, an association of sports journalists. That year she was also named Lower Austria's sportswoman of the year and won the international success category at Die Presse's Austrian of the Year awards. Farr, Stephen (2023-01-31).
