Hegemone /həˈdʒɛməniː/, also known as Jupiter XXXIX, is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, and given the temporary designation S/2003 J 8. Hegemone is about 3 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,703,000 km in 745.500 days, at an inclination of 153° to the ecliptic (151° to Jupiter's equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.4077. It was named in March 2005 after Hegemone, one of the Graces, and a daughter of Zeus (Jupiter). Hegemone belongs to the Pasiphae group, irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22.8 and 24.1 Gm, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5° and 158.3°. S.S.
