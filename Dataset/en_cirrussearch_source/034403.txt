Forst (Lausitz) (German) or Baršć (Łužyca) (Lower Sorbian, pronounced [ˈbarɕtɕ ˈwuʒɨtsa]) is a town in Lower Lusatia, Brandenburg, in eastern Germany. It lies east of Cottbus, on the Lusatian Neisse river which is also the German-Polish border. It is the capital of the Spree-Neiße district. It is known for its rose garden and textile museum. The town's population is 18,651. In Forst, there is a railway bridge across the Neiße belonging to the line Cottbus–Żary which is serviced by regional trains and a EuroCity train between Hamburg and Kraków (2011). There is also a road bridge across the river north of Forst.

Known as the "Salt Road", it was used to transport salt from Halle to Lusatia and further east to Poland. By 1265 it was developing into a permanent trading settlement round the Church of St Nicholas. The commercial importance of Forst increased with the development of a north–south route connecting to Guben, downstream along the Neisse River. In the fourteenth century the council was able to take on responsibility for the lower courts locally. In 1352 of Ileburg took over the overlordship of Forst from Frederick III of Meissen. At various times the town was under the suzerainty of Bohemian, Hungarian, Saxon and Polish monarchs. In 1628, clothiers from Leszno, Międzyrzecz and Wschowa in Poland settled in the town. In 1746, it was purchased by Heinrich von Brühl, minister of Augustus III of Poland. In 1749, a new postal route was established from Warsaw and Poznań to Dresden, which led through the town. Forst was awarded to the Kingdom of Prussia in the 1815 Congress of Vienna. The town was administered as a part of the Province of Brandenburg from 1815 to 1947. During World War II, in 1942–1943, the Germans operated a forced labour camp for Jewish men in the town. After the war it became part of the State of Brandenburg, which became one of the constituent parts of the German Democratic Republic in 1949. From 1952 to 1990, it was part of the East German Bezirk Cottbus. Since German reunification in 1990, it is again part of Brandenburg. Forst has experienced severe problems as a result of the 1990 German reunification, most notably from extreme unemployment. In the past, the town was known for textile manufacturing, but all of the textile plants and factories have closed down.
