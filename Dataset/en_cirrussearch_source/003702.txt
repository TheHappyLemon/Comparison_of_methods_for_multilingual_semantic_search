The Prince Charles Mountains are a major group of mountains in Mac. Robertson Land in Antarctica, including the Athos Range, the Porthos Range, and the Aramis Range. The highest peak is Mount Menzies, with a height of 3,228 m (10,591 ft). Other prominent peaks are Mount Izabelle and Mount Stinear (1,950 m; 6,400 ft). These mountains, together with other scattered peaks, form an arc about 420 km (260 mi) long, extending from the vicinity of Mount Starlight in the north to Goodspeed Nunataks in the south. These mountains were first observed and photographed from a distance by airmen of USN Operation Highjump, 1946–47. They were examined by several ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) parties and mapped in the years 1954–61. They have been found to contain large deposits of iron ore. They were named by ANCA in 1956 for King Charles III, then the eight-year-old Prince Charles and son of the late Queen Elizabeth II.

Cumpston Massif is a prominent, flat-topped rock outcrop, about 2,070 metres (6,800 ft) high, 9 miles (14 km) long and 6 miles (10 km) wide, at the junction of Lambert Glacier and Mellor Glacier. It attracts many people. Cumpston Massif was discovered in November 1956, from an ANARE aircraft, and named by ANCA for Dr J. S. Cumpston of the Australian Department of External Affairs who, along with E. P. Bayliss, was responsible for the map of the Antarctic published in 1939 by the Property and Survey Branch, Department of the Interior, Canberra. Fisher Massif (72°19′S 67°40′E﻿ / ﻿72.317°S 67.667°E﻿ / -72.317; 67.667) is a rock massif about 16 nautical miles (30 km) long and 5 nautical miles (9 km) wide, standing at the west side of Lambert Glacier about 42 nautical miles (78 km) south of the Aramis Range. It was discovered by an ANARE party led by B.H. Stinear in October 1957, and was named by ANCA for Morris M. Fisher, a surveyor at Mawson Station in 1957. The Blustery Cliffs are on the northern part of Fisher Massif, while Mount Johnston is the southernmost and highest of its peaks, at 1,770 metres (5,800 ft). The Bennett Escarpment (70°36′S 64°19′E﻿ / ﻿70.600°S 64.317°E﻿ / -70.600; 64.317) is a rock and ice escarpment curving in a general southwest direction for 20 nautical miles (37 km) from Mount Pollard.

A point on the cliffs 1,135 metres (3,724 ft) high was occupied as a survey station by J. Manning, a surveyor with the ANARE Prince Charles Mountains survey party in January 1969. They are so named because of the great amount of turbulence caused by updraft currents.

The group was plotted from air photos taken by ANARE aircraft in 1956. They were named by ANCA for C.S. Nilsson, a physicist at Mawson Station in 1957. Scylla Glacier (70°20′S 67°0′E﻿ / ﻿70.333°S 67.000°E﻿ / -70.333; 67.000) is a large glacier draining eastward between the Athos and Porthos ranges of the Prince Charles Mountains. Discovered in December 1956 by ANARE southern party led by W.G. Bewsher. It was named after Homer's Scylla because of the difficulty in traversing the region due to the glacier. Taylor Platform (71°1′S 67°9′E﻿ / ﻿71.017°S 67.150°E﻿ / -71.017; 67.150) is a low, fairly flat rock massif about 1 nautical mile (1.9 km) north of Mount Brocklehurst.
