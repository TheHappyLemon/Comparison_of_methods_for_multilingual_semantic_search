Edward Löwe (also Eduard Loewe; 23 September 1794 – 24 February 1880) was a Bohemian-born, after 1830 naturalized English chess master. Löwe was born in Prague and died in London. In 1847, he won a match with Howard Staunton (5–2), but his opponent gave odds of pawn and two moves. In regular matches, he won against Hugh Alexander Kennedy (7½–6½) in 1849, and lost to Frederick Deacon (2½–7½) in 1851, James Hannah (8–13) in 1857, and Paul Morphy (0–6) in 1858. The match against Morphy took place in Lowe's Hotel, which belonged to Löwe. In tournaments, he won against Arthur Simons (2–0) and lost to George Webb Medley (1½–2½) at London 1849 (Ries' Divan, Henry Thomas Buckle won), and lost a match to Marmaduke Wyvill (0–2) at the London 1851 chess tournament (Adolf Anderssen won).
