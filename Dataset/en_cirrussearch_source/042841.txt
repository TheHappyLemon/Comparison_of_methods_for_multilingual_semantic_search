Victory Park (Latvian: Uzvaras parks) is a park in Riga, located on the left bank of the Daugava, in the district of Āgenskalns.The modern area of the park is 36.7 hectares. When Latvia was in the Russian Empire, the park was known as Riga Petrovsky Park (Russian: Петровский парк, Latvian: Pētera parks). It was created in 1909 in preparation for celebrations to mark the bicentenary of the transfer of Livonia to the Russian Empire from Sweden during the Great Northern War. The official opening ceremony of the park complex took place in the middle of 1910 in the presence of Tsar Nicholas II, and the Mayor of Riga George Armitstead. In 1923, the park was renamed Victory Park in honor of the victory in 1919 over the West Russian Volunteer Army under the command of Colonel Pavel Bermondt-Avalov during the Latvian War of Independence. In 1930, a reconstruction of the park was carried out, aimed at creating a new socially significant leisure center for the population of the Latvian capital. In 1938, the 9th Latvian Song Festival was held in a temporary grandstand in the park. A grand renovation plan, proposed in 1938–1939 during a contest organized during the dictatorship of Kārlis Ulmanis by architects Frīdrihs Skujiņš and Georgs Auders, envisioned a wide 'Alley of Victory' and a torchlight-crowned, 60-meter-tall 'Victory Tower'; a mass event and parade ground with stands and a permanent grandstand for the Song Festival; a velodrome; sports hall with a capacity of 10,000; a stadium and a new harbour in Āgenskalns Bay. Despite receiving around 3 million Ls in donations, the works did not commence due to the start of World War II. During the Soviet occupation, the Riga City Council decided to rename the park after the 1961 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1985, the Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders was opened, and at this point, the Riga City Council renamed the park to Victory Park again. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the monument was removed on 22–25 August. After redevelopment, the first stage of the park was reopened for the public on Lāčplēsis Day 2023. http://www.polilogi.lv/article_new.php?t=1&id=107&lang=1[dead link] Evdokimov Alexey (2015). Рига.
