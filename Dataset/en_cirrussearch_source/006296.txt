.ye is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Republic of Yemen. In 2015, when the Houthis took over the Yemeni capital, the rebel forces also took over the main internet provider and distributor of the .ye domain, which remains under their control. According to DomainTools, 1152 .ye domain names were registered as of 2018. In order to register a .YE domain, you must have a company registered in Yemen. However, some registrars provide a local presence service for non-Yemeni clients. Domain names also need to be hosted in the Republic of Yemen. There are eight Second Level Domains: com.ye: Commercial Entities co.ye: Companies ltd.ye: Limited Companies me.ye: Private Individuals net.ye: Network Providers org.ye: Non-commercial Organizations plc.ye: Public Companies gov.ye: Government and Governmental System A second top domain will be used for the Republic of Yemen, intended for domain names in the local language. The string اليمن (al-Yaman) was registered and approved for this purpose in March 2011, but it was not activated and lower level domains were not granted at that time.
