Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is a 2018 jukebox musical romantic comedy film written and directed by Ol Parker, from a story by Parker, Catherine Johnson, and Richard Curtis. It is the sequel to the 2008 film Mamma Mia!, which in turn is based on the 1999 musical of the same name using the music of ABBA. The film features an ensemble cast, including Christine Baranski, Pierce Brosnan, Dominic Cooper, Colin Firth, Andy García, Lily James, Amanda Seyfried, Stellan Skarsgård, Julie Walters, Cher, Meryl Streep, Alexa Davies, Jessica Keenan Wynn, Josh Dylan, Jeremy Irvine, and Hugh Skinner. Both a prequel and a sequel, the plot is set after the events of the previous film, and is intersected with flashbacks to Donna's youth in 1979, with some scenes from the two time periods mirroring each other. Due to the financial success of the first film, Universal Pictures had long been interested in a sequel. The film was officially announced in May 2017, with Parker hired to write and direct. In June 2017, many of the original cast confirmed their involvement, with James being cast in the role of Young Donna that July. Filming took place from August to December 2017 in Croatia (most prominently Vis), Bordeaux, Stockholm, Oxford, Hampton and at Shepperton Studios. A British and American joint venture, the film was co-produced by Playtone, Littlestar Productions, Perfect World Pictures, and Legendary Entertainment. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was premiered at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on July 16, 2018, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on July 20, 2018, ten years to the week after its predecessor's release, in both standard and IMAX formats. The film was a box office success, grossing $402 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews, as an improvement over its predecessor with critics praising the performances and musical numbers. The film is dedicated to the memory of production designer Alan MacDonald. In a 1979 flashback, young Donna Sheridan graduates from Oxford's New College with Rosie and Tanya ("When I Kissed the Teacher"), and dreams of the Greek island Kalokairi. Her mother Ruby is a famous singer, but they have a strained relationship, she is always away on tour so does not attend the graduation. Fed up with her mother's constant absence and determined to spend her life making memories, Donna travels to Kalokairi to find her destiny. In the present, Sophie is in Kalokairi preparing the grand reopening of the Hotel Bella Donna in honour of her recently deceased mother. Harry and Bill can't attend due to overseas obligations and Sophie also feels estranged from Sky, who has been offered a job in NYC ("One of Us"). In Paris, Donna meets the sweet, awkward Harry Bright, who instantly falls in love with her ("Waterloo"). They spend the night together, but Donna leaves early for Greece. Missing her boat to Kalokairi, Bill Anderson gives her a lift in his sailboat, where they dance and flirt ("Why Did It Have to Be Me?"). On the way, they help stranded fisherman Alexio back to shore in time to save the love of his life from marrying another. Unbeknownst to Donna, Harry has followed her to Greece, however he arrives too late and she sails off with Bill. In the present, Rosie and Tanya arrive and Sophie shows them the renovated hotel ("I Have a Dream"). This mirrors the past, when Donna explores the abandoned farmhouse that would eventually become the hotel. A heavy storm then breaks out and Donna discovers a trapped horse and soothes it with the assistance of Sam Carmichael. In the present, a heavy storm both destroys the decorations and cuts off ferries to Kalokairi, to Sophie's dismay. Sam, who lives in a cabin on the island, reassures Sophie that she can never disappoint her mother, unlike him. Before Sophie was born, Donna and Sam were enjoying a whirlwind romance ("The Name of the Game") which ended badly when she discovered he was engaged to another. Heartbroken, Donna breaks it off and tearfully watches him leave the island ("Knowing Me, Knowing You"), while the present Sam reassures Sophie how important she was to her. Following Sam's departure, Donna is visited by Tanya and Rosie, who cheer her up by performing as Donna and the Dynamos ("Mamma Mia"). Bill returns to the island, and she joins him on his boat, much to the chagrin of Rosie who fell for Bill. While they are gone, Sam returns, having ended his engagement for Donna, but is saddened to hear she is with another. Donna discovers she is pregnant but has no idea which one of her three recent lovers is the father. Bill's great-aunt Sofia overhears Donna's wish to stay on the island and reveals she owns the abandoned farmhouse where she has been staying. Donna happily accepts her offer to stay there, where she later gives birth to Sophie. In the present, Sophie tells Rosie and Tanya about her problems with Sky, and Rosie explains how she and Bill broke up ("Angel Eyes"). Meanwhile, Bill, Harry, and Sky leave their ventures abroad to support Sophie but are told there are no boats to Kalokairi. However, Alexio recognises Bill so offers the trio safe boat passage to the island as gratitude for saving his relationship. Bill convinces everyone to join them for the Kalokairi party. When the guests arrive ("Dancing Queen"), Bill and Rosie soon reunite over their mutual grief over Donna's death, and Sophie tells Sky she is pregnant and never feeling closer to her mother. The celebration is suddenly disrupted when Ruby arrives, despite not being invited by Sophie. Ruby explains that Sky tracked her down, and she wants to build a relationship with her granddaughter. Sophie then performs with the Dynamos in honour of Donna ("I've Been Waiting for You"). Ruby is proud, and expresses slight but sincere grief over her daughter's death. Then it is revealed that the hotel manager, Señor Fernando Cienfuegos, is Ruby's long-lost lover from 1959, so they are joyously reunited ("Fernando"). Nine months later, Sophie gives birth to baby boy Donny. At the christening, Donna's ghost proudly watches, and they have a final moment before Donna fully passes on ("My Love, My Life").

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as its predecessor, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 83% overall positive score. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian termed the sequel as "weirdly irresistible" and gave it three out of five stars. He described his reaction to the first film as "a combination of hives and bubonic plague", but concedes that this time, the relentlessness and greater self-aware comedy made him smile. He concludes: "More enjoyable than I thought. But please. Enough now." Mark Kermode of The Observer gave the film five stars and commented, "This slick sequel delivers sharp one-liners, joyously contrived plot twists and an emotional punch that left our critic reeling." Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded the film two and a half stars out of five, noting the absence of Streep for the majority of the film hindered his enjoyment, and saying, "her absence is deeply felt since the three-time Oscar winner sang and danced her heart out as Donna Sheridan". Lindsay Bahr of Associated Press awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it "wholly ridiculous", but complimenting its self-awareness. She also praised James' performance and singing talent. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the sequel a mixed review, awarding it two stars out of four, criticizing the reprises of "Dancing Queen" and "Super Trouper" as uninspired, and feeling that some of the musical numbers dragged the pacing. He considered the younger counterparts to the main characters "energetic" and "likeable". Stephanie Zacharek of Time gave the film a mixed review, writing "Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is atrocious. And wonderful. It's all the reasons you should never go to the movies. And all the reasons you should race to get a ticket." In June 2020, Judy Craymer announced that a third film was in development, with the producer confirming that some of the new ABBA songs written for the band's reunion could feature in the soundtrack, although stating that the COVID-19 pandemic had caused delays with development of the project. After months of postponement, ABBA released their new album Voyage in November 2021. In an interview with BBC Two's Newsnight in May 2023, Andersson expressed his skepticism about the prospect of a sequel, describing it as "wishful thinking" and saying he would not like to see a sequel made unless there were substantial changes. In October 2023, Craymer reaffirmed a third film. The events are set five years after Mamma Mia! (2008) Gleiberman, Owen (17 July 2018). "Film Review: 'Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again'". Variety.
