Davidovs played for FK Avots until 2000, when he started his professional career with FK Ventspils in the Latvian Higher League. He made only one appearance through the season, being a total backup keeper. In 2002, he left FK Ventspils, going to a one level lower league and joining FK Auda in Riga. He played 10 matches there and in 2003 had a spell in Lithuania with FK Ekranas. In 2004, he came back to Latvia, signing a contract with Latvian Higher League club Dinaburg FC in Daugavpils. Also this time he could not capitalize in the league and played only one match. In 2005, he returned to FK Ventspils and stayed there for 2 seasons, mostly being the second-choice goalkeeper, and making 17 appearances. In 2008, he joined Daugava Daugavpils.

He made 11 good appearances and had an offer in Belarus from FC Shakhtyor Soligorsk, that he could not reject. He played there for 2 years. In the second season he mostly played in the reserve team. At the start of 2011 he decided to terminate his contract with the club, and in March, after becoming a free agent, he signed a contract with Mash'al Mubarek, playing in the Uzbek League. He left the Uzbek side at the start of 2012, returning to Latvia and joining the Latvian Higher League club FC Jūrmala. He took the first-choice keeper's spot right after joining. Playing 14 league matches at the club, he once again left – this time for the Lithuanian A Lyga club FK Sūduva Marijampolė.
