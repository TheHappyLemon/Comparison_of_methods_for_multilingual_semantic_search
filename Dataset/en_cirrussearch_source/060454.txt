On 3 April 2013, Pedan was signed to a three-year entry-level contract with the Islanders. Unable to establish himself amongst the Islanders' prospects within the affiliates, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the AHL and the Stockton Thunder of the ECHL, Pedan was traded in the 2014–15 season by the Islanders to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for Alexandre Mallet and a third-round pick on 26 November 2014.

He was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins for the duration of the campaign. He notched AHL personal highs of 9 goals and 26 points in 52 games. On 4 July 2018, Pedan as a restricted free agent from the Penguins opted to sign a two-year contract to return to Russia with reigning champions, Ak Bars Kazan of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). On 29 April 2020, Pedan was re-signed to a one-year contract. On 4 May 2021, Pedan signed a two-year contract with HC Dynamo Moscow of the KHL.
