Ipil, officially the Municipality of Ipil (Cebuano: Lungsod sa Ipil; Maguindanaon: Inged nu Ipil, Jawi: ايڠد نو ايڤل Chavacano: Municipalidad de Ipil), is a 1st class municipality and capital of the province of Zamboanga Sibugay, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 89,401 people. Ipil is the most populous municipality of Zamboanga Sibugay, and the second most populous in Region IX after Sindangan. Ipil Airport is located at Barangay Sanito, along the Pan Philippine Highway, and it is the only airport in Zamboanga Sibugay. Ipil used to be known as Sanito, a place under barrio Bacalan under the Municipality of Kabasalan. It was a swampy area and a docking spot for pioneering Ilocanos who settled in the upper areas of Titay. Ipil was a jumping point for their lantsa sailing to Zamboanga City. The first mayor of Ipil was Gregorio Dar, an Ilocano who came from Titay. The Dar Family were the second batch of Ilocanos who settled upon the invitation of Mariano Families who are among the first batch of Ilocanos from Luzon. When Sanito became a Town in 1949, its name was changed to Ipil, as there were many Ipil trees found within the said locale. The territory was further reduced when, through Batas Pambansa Blg. 183 of 1982, fourteen barangays were separated to create the municipality of Roseller Lim. The first Ilocanos used Ipil as the nearest jump point in connecting Titay with Zamboanga City. They would walk via Lumbia then to Longilog then Gabo reaching Mayabang their original settlement. It was this route that they do not have to cross the rivers as it is uphill. It was the Ilocanos who first set foot on these areas.Mayabang came from the first Tagalog settlers who intermarried with the first ilocano settlers of the place. On the morning of April 3, 1995, Ipil was attacked by approximately 200 heavily armed Abu Sayyaf militants who fired upon residents, strafed civilian homes, plundered banks, took up to 30 hostages and then burned the centre of the town to the ground. The militants allegedly arrived in the town by boat and bus, and a number of them had been dressed in military clothing. The town's Chief of Police was reportedly killed in the attack and close to a billion pesos were looted from eight commercial banks. Army commandos pursued some rebel gunmen in nearby mountains while officials said that the rebels were looting farms and seizing civilians as "human shields" as they fled the town of about 40 rebels, who may have taken hostages, were cornered in a school compound west of Ipil on April 6 when an elite army unit attacked. In the fighting that followed, the television station GMA reported, 11 civilians were killed. In the 19th Congress of the Philippines, house bills were filed by various representatives which seeks Ipil including other capital towns of provinces with no current component cities, independent component cities or highly urbanized cities to automatically convert into cities. Ipil is located three hours from the key cities in the region (Dipolog, Pagadian and Zamboanga City). The Ipil seaport is 4 kilometres (2 mi) south of the town center. Ipil is subdivided into 28 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.
