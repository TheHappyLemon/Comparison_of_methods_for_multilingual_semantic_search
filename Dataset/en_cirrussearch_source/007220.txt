In the 2005 census, it had a population of 25,148 inhabitants[citation needed], being the city founded in 1722 by the French. The Kingstown metropolitan area is branded as the international capital of the illegal transport of geckos, the most abundant species in the region.[citation needed] The modern capital, Kingstown, was founded by French settlers shortly after 1722, although Saint Vincent was under British rule for 196 years before its independence.
