Chaenorhinum is a genus consisting of four species of annual and perennial herbs native to Turkey and the Mediterranean, where they thrive in dry stony areas and scree. They are closely related to snapdragons. The leaves are linear to oblong or rounded, opposite at the base. The flowers resemble snapdragons, being typically zygomorphic, hooded, lobed and spurred. They are borne in terminal racemes or singly in the leaf axils of the branching stems. Chaenorhinum minus (also known as "small toadflax" or "dwarf snapdragon",) Chaenorhinum origanifolium (syn.
