In November 2003, as part of the celebration of UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player for Azerbaijan by the Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan as the country's most outstanding player over the past 50 years. Banishevskiy was born in Baku to a family of Ukrainian descent. He started playing football at the age of 16 and played all of his career for Neftçi, transforming into one of the best Azerbaijani players. Upon making the club's senior roster at the age of 16, Banishevskiy immediately emerged into one of the best young talents of his generation. Banishevskiy maintained his status of a premier Azerbaijani player, and remained very influential football figure throughout his entire football profession and beyond. Banishevskiy made his international debut at 19 years old on 4 July 1965 for USSR against Brazil during a friendly match.

Banishevskiy was diagnosed with diabetic coma in 1991, having survived his first attack in 1987. He suffered cerebral atrophy as result of a second attack, which also caused him memory loss. Subsequently, following his wife's ill-timed behavior, Banishevskiy lost the ownership of his house, which led him to live a difficult life in alcoholism on the streets of Baku. However, he was rescued from this difficult situation by his old supporter and beloved follower Saida, who cared for him in his last years of his life and ultimately married him. On 10 December 1997, Banishevskiy died after a third diabetic coma attack, having also suffered pancreatitis. His grandson Ali Babayev Banishevskiy began to play in the youth team of Neftçi in 2011 when he was 15. Currently, Ali plays professional football in Azerbaijan's First Division for Shusha FK.
