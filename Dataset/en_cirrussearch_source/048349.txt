Sailing has been included as an event at every Summer Olympics since 1896 except the 1904 Summer Olympics. At the 1980 Summer Olympics sailing events were organised into six classes. In each class seven races in a particular sailing discipline were contested between the 19 and 29 July 1980. The Olympic city in 1980 was Moscow, but all sailing events took place in the Baltic Sea off the coast of Pirita, in Tallinn in present-day Estonia. At the time Tallinn was part of the Soviet Union. Events at this olympiad used triangular-type Olympic courses. According to the IOC statutes the contests in all sport disciplines must be held either in, or as close as possible to the city which the IOC has chosen. Since Moscow was not a suitable place the Olympic Yachting Centre in Pirita Tallinn was constructed for the 1980 Olympic Sailing event. Europe Africa Americas The boycott affected the medalists in most sailing events with a number of European and World champions not participating. In the Soiling, the Canadian World champion team of Glen Dexter, Andreas Josenhans and [Sandy McMillan] was absent. Some British athletes participated in the Games under a neutral flag, but the sailing federation chose to join the boycott. In several classes an alternative sailing event was organized by the boycotting nations, with the Flying Dutchman class having been held Luxembourg. 1980 Olympic Classes designs During the sailing regattas at the 1980 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing in the various classes:  Soviet Union (URS), Valentin Mankin, multi-medalist in the Star  Romania (ROM), Mihai Butucaru, later committee member of Eurosaf "Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics".
