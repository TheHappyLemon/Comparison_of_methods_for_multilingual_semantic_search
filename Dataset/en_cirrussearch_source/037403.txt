Following this, he won the gold medal at the Pan American Youth Chess Festival in various age categories: under 10 (2005), under 12 (2006), under 14 (2008) and under 18 (2009). Cori also won the gold medal at the World Youth Chess Championships in the under 14 category in 2009 and the under 16 in 2011.

He qualified for the Grandmaster title in January 2010, at the age of 14 years, 5 months and 15 days, when he crossed the 2500 Elo rating mark during the 3rd Jose Marca Memorial Open in Lima, which he won with a score of 7½/9 points.

In the following month, he competed in the World Cup in Tromsø, Norway; after drawing the two classical games against Teimour Radjabov, Cori won the first rapid game, but lost the second one. In the third game he didn't show up in time, as Cori, due to language barrier, misunderstood the start time (6:50 instead of 6:15), and was forfeited due to "zero tolerance" rule; he drew the fourth game and therefore was eliminated from the tournament. Later that month, in August 2013, he placed second at the Open of Sants, Hostafrancs & La Bordeta in Barcelona, behind Baskaran Adhiban. In September 2013, Cori tied for 3rd–4th in the World Junior Championship. He tied for first place, placing third on countback, in the 3rd Panama Open scoring 7/9.

In May 2015, his first place the Zonal 2.4 Championship qualified him for the Chess World Cup 2015. Later in the same month, he finished third in the 10th American Continental Championship in Montevideo. Cori decided to not participate in the World Cup in order to compete for the last time in the World Junior Championship and his spot was taken by his sister Deysi, who finished third in the Zonal 2.4 Championship.
