Skyscanner is a search aggregator and travel agency based in Edinburgh, Scotland. The site is available in over 30 languages and is used by 100 million people per month. The company lets people research and book travel options for their trips, including flights, hotels and car hire. The company was formed in 2003 by three information technology professionals, Gareth Williams, Barry Smith, and Bonamy Grimes, after Gareth was frustrated by the difficulties of finding cheap flights to ski resorts. Skyscanner was first developed and released in 2002.[citation needed] In 2003, the first employee was hired to assist with site development.[citation needed] The Edinburgh office was opened in 2004. In 2008, Skyscanner received first round funding of £2.5 million from venture capital firm Scottish Equity Partners (SEP). In 2009, the year after SEP invested in the business, Skyscanner reported its first profit. In 2011, Skyscanner acquired Zoombu. Skyscanner opened an office in Singapore in September 2011, which is headquarters for its Asia-Pacific operations. In 2012, a Beijing office was added, as Skyscanner began a partnership with Baidu, China's largest search engine. By 2013, the company employed over 180 people. In February 2013, Skyscanner announced plans to open a United States base in Miami. In October 2013, Sequoia Capital purchased an interest in Skyscanner that valued the company at $800 million. In June 2014, Skyscanner acquired Youbibi, a travel search engine company based in Shenzhen, China. In October 2014, Skyscanner acquired the Budapest-based mobile app developer Distinction. By February 2015, the company employed 600 people, double the employment of 18 months earlier. In January 2016, the company raised $192 million based on a $1.6 billion valuation for the company. In November 2016, a Chinese company Trip.com Group (formerly Ctrip) bought Skyscanner for $1.75 billion. Following the sale to Ctrip, Skyscanner's largest shareholder, SEP, completed its exit from the business. In 2017, Ctrip bought the Trip.com domain and launched Trip.com. The original platform became a subsidiary of Skyscanner. In 2020, after COVID-19 rocked the travel industry, the company announced that it would lay off 300 employees (20% of its staff). It was licely to close close two offices in Budapest, Hungary and Sofia, Bulgaria. In 2022, Skyscanner partnered with Huawei to bring various travel services Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) and Petal Search and Petal Maps.
