PocketBook is a multinational company which produces e-book readers based on E Ink technology (an electronic paper technology) under the PocketBook brand. The company was founded in 2007 in Kyiv, Ukraine, and its headquarters were shifted to Lugano, Switzerland in 2012. These devices enable users to browse, buy, download, and read e-books, newspapers, magazines and other digital media via wireless networking to the PocketBook Store. The devices are assembled by factories such as Foxconn, Wisky and Yitoa and shipped out to more than 40 countries. Models from the same family sometimes use the same model numbers, such as: Touch HD PB631... Touch HD 2 PB631-2... The company's products are sold in 35 countries worldwide – in Central, Eastern, and Western Europe, in Baltic and Commonwealth of Independent States countries, as well as in Australia, Israel, New Zealand, and others. As of December 2013[update], PocketBook claimed it had sold over two million e-reader and tablet devices.
