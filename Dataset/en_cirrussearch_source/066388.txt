Sharon Mills Draper (born August 21, 1948) is an American children's writer, professional educator, and the 1997 National Teacher of the Year. She is a five-time winner of the Coretta Scott King Award for books about the young and adolescent African-American experience. She is known for her Hazelwood and Jericho series, Copper Sun, Double Dutch, Out of My Mind and Romiette and Julio. Draper was born in Cleveland, Ohio to Victor D. Mills and Catherine Gachett Mills. She is the oldest of 3 and has two younger siblings. Growing up, she played the piano and loved to read. By eleven she had read nearly every children's book in her local library and was given a special library card in order to be allowed to check out adult books. Draper earned her Bachelor's Degree, majoring in English, from Pepperdine University and her Master's of Arts degree in English from Miami University of Ohio in 1974. Post-graduation, she began teaching in Cincinnati public schools. During this time she became locally famous for her "Draper Paper," a challenging research paper assigned to graduating seniors. She is married and has four children. Her own writing career began in 1990 when, as a teacher, she was challenged by a ninth-grade student to "write something." She entered a short story entitled "One Small Torch" to a writing contest through Ebony magazine. Upon winning, Draper was awarded five thousand dollars and her story was published. Among those who wrote to congratulate her was Roots author Alex Haley. She credits this letter with helping her realize that she could be a writer. In 2000, she retired from teaching in order to spend more time on her writing. Draper lives in Cincinnati with her husband. Sharon Draper has five Coretta Scott King Book Awards - Author Award Winner: 1998 Forged by Fire, 2007 Copper Sun; Author Honor: 2004 The Battle of Jericho, 2008 November Blues; John Steptoe Award for New Talent: 1995 Tears of a Tiger.

Draper, 1997) ISBN 978-1881786801 Buttered Bones (Sharon M. Draper, 1997) ISBN 978-1881786757 Many of Draper's books for children and young adults contain mature and serious themes, such as death, grief, and abuse. Draper has said that she uses these themes as they are "the realities of life" for many young people. One major theme touched on in Draper's Out of My Mind, which tells the story of a young girl with cerebral palsy, is young people and disabilities. Another major theme in Draper's books, such as Forged by Fire and Romiette and Julio, is race. In Romiette and Julio, an African American girl and Hispanic boy begin dating, despite familial disapproval and threats from a local gang. Zonnenberg states that the story's focus on complex issues such as gang violence and interracial relationships encourages deep discussion by all readers. While Romiette and Julio puts the main characters' races at the forefront of the plot, Price notes that Draper takes the opposite approach in Forged by Fire. Price writes that while many characters in this book are African American, Draper focuses more on character actions. Because Draper centers more on narrative and character development, readers come away with a sense that race and ethnicity make up only one part of an individual's identity. Other novels by Draper that focus on race include Fire from the Rock, Stella by Starlight, and Blended. "Sharon M.
