After just four first-team appearances in all competitions, his loan spell was terminated by the end of the year. In January 2019, Sadiq joined Serie B side Perugia for the remainder of the season. He scored three times in 17 appearances, helping his team to an eight-place finish with a chance to win promotion to Serie A via the playoffs. However, Perugia lost in the preliminary round to Verona after extra time. In early July 2019, Sadiq completed his loan move to Serbian club Partizan that included an option to buy.
