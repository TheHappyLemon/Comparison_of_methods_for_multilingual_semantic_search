He was one of the major representatives of Colombian popular folk music and was lead singer and co-founder, alongside fellow accordionist Israel Romero, of the vallenato group Binomio de Oro de América, which was very popular in Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. Orozco was born in Becerril, Cesar. He was assassinated by gunmen in front of his house in Barranquilla, Atlántico, during his daughter's 15th birthday party (quinceañera). It is believed the assassins were hired by a drug lord whose wife or girlfriend was obsessed with Orozco. It has been alleged that Orozco had a sentimental relationship with a young woman named Maria Angelica Navarro Ogliasti, identified as the girlfriend of Medellin Cartel hitman Jose Reinaldo Fiallo, who was himself murdered on November 1992 on orders of Pablo Escobar.

In 1975 after High School, he recorded two albums with accordion player Emilio Oviedo. The title of her first album was Adelante and The second one was named Con entusiasmo.

Two months later they founded the musical group Binomio de Oro de América, with this group they won three Congos de Oro at the Barranquilla's Carnival, 16 gold records and two platinum records for millionaire sales worldwide.
