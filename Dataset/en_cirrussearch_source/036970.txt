Tony Rominger (born 27 March 1961 in Vejle, Denmark) is a Swiss former professional road racing cyclist who won the Vuelta a España in 1992, 1993 and 1994 and the Giro d'Italia in 1995. He began cycling late, allegedly spurred by competition with his brother. Rominger's strengths were time-trialling, climbing and recuperation. He was a rival to Miguel Indurain in the Tour de France and was placed second in 1993 and won the mountains classification. His three wins in the Vuelta were a record at the time. In 2005, Roberto Heras broke that record but two months later tested positive for the blood-boosting drug EPO and was disqualified. Heras' win has since been reinstated. In 1994 Rominger broke the world hour record twice in a few days. He used Bordeaux velodrome to ride 53.832 km and then 55.291 km, although a track novice. He retired in 1997 after breaking his collarbone at that year's Tour de France. He is the agent of Austrian racing cyclist Matthias Brändle. For his attempt on the Hour Record in 1994, he was coached by Dr Michele Ferrari, who was at the trackside during the ride. 1984 6th Overall Grand Prix Guillaume Tell 1985 10th Grand Prix des Nations 1986 5th Grand Prix des Nations 8th Firenze–Pistoia 1987 1st Giro della Provincia di Reggio Calabria 3rd Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 3rd Overall Giro del Trentino 3rd Milano–Torino 5th Overall Tour Méditerranéen 8th Coppa Placci 9th Grand Prix des Nations 9th Firenze–Pistoia 1988 1st Giro dell'Emilia 1st Firenze–Pistoia 1st Stage 13 Giro d'Italia 2nd Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 2nd Overall Tour de Romandie 1st Prologue 2nd Overall Giro del Trentino 1st Stage 2 2nd Giro del Lazio 3rd Züri-Metzgete 5th Giro di Lombardia 7th Overall Tour Méditerranéen 1st Stage 5 (ITT) 1989 1st Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Overall Tour Méditerranéen 1st Stage 4b (ITT) 1st Giro di Lombardia 1st Firenze–Pistoia 2nd UCI Road World Cup 3rd Clásica de San Sebastián 3rd Milano–Torino 4th Giro dell'Emilia 5th Overall Volta a Catalunya 6th Overall Tour de Romandie 7th Züri-Metzgete 1990 1st Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Stage 2 2nd Overall Tour Méditerranéen 1st Stage 4 2nd Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme 3rd Grand Prix des Nations 4th Overall Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré 1st Stage 3 4th Clásica de San Sebastián 4th Tour du Haut Var 4th Trofeo Baracchi 1991 1st Overall Paris–Nice 1st Stages 1 (TTT), 5 & 7 (ITT) 1st Overall Tour de Romandie 1st Stages 2 & 5b (ITT) 1st Grand Prix des Nations (Trofeo Baracchi) 1st Firenze–Pistoia 2nd Overall Tour Méditerranéen 2nd Milano–Torino 3rd Overall Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré 1st Stage 8 (ITT) 6th Grand Prix des Amériques 1992 1st Overall Vuelta a España 1st Combination classification 1st Stages 19 (ITT) & 20 1st Overall Tour of the Basque Country 1st Stages 2 & 5b (ITT) 1st Giro di Lombardia 1st Firenze–Pistoia 1st Subida al Naranco 2nd UCI Road World Cup 2nd Overall Paris–Nice 1st Prologue & Stage 5 2nd Overall Volta a Catalunya 1st Mountains classification 1st Stage 6 2nd Overall Vuelta Asturias 1st Stage 1a 2nd Overall Escalada a Montjuïc 1st Stage 1b (ITT) 2nd Grand Prix des Nations 3rd Milano–Torino 4th Overall Tour of Galicia 4th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 5th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 1993 1st Overall Vuelta a España 1st Points classification 1st Mountains classification 1st Stages 11, 14 & 19 1st Overall Tour of the Basque Country 1st Stages 1, 4 & 5b (ITT) 1st Subida a Urkiola 1st Polynormande 2nd Overall Tour de France 1st Mountains classification 1st Stages 10, 11 & 19 (ITT) 2nd Overall Critérium International 1st Stage 2 2nd Liège–Bastogne–Liège 5th Telekom Grand Prix (with Olaf Ludwig) 8th Overall Paris–Nice 1994 Hour record: 55.291 km (5 Nov 1994) Hour record: 53.832 km (22 Oct 1994) 1st Overall Vuelta a España 1st Stages 1 (ITT), 6, 8 (ITT), 11, 14 & 20 (ITT) 1st Overall Tour of the Basque Country 1st Stages 3 & 5b (ITT) 1st Overall Paris–Nice 1st Stage 8b (ITT) 1st Overall Escalada a Montjuich 1st Stages 1a & 1b (ITT) 1st Grand Prix Eddy Merckx 1st Grand Prix des Nations 1st Telekom Grand Prix (with Jens Lehmann) 2nd Overall Critérium International 3rd Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 6th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 6th Milano–Torino 1995 1st Overall Giro d'Italia 1st Points classification 1st Intergiro classification 1st Stages 2 (ITT), 4, 10 (ITT) & 17 (ITT) 1st Overall Tour de Romandie 1st Prologue, Stages 3 & 5b (ITT) 1st Telekom Grand Prix (with Andrea Chiurato) 1st Stage 3 Giro del Trentino 3rd Overall Tour of the Basque Country 1st Stage 4 3rd Grand Prix Eddy Merckx 8th Overall Tour de France 1996 1st Overall Vuelta a Burgos 1st Stages 2 & 4 (ITT) 1st À travers Lausanne 2nd Overall Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré UCI Road World Championships 3rd Time trial 9th Road race 3rd Overall Vuelta a España 1st Mountains classification 1st Stages 10 (ITT) & 21 (ITT) 3rd Overall Tour DuPont 4th Overall Euskal Bizikleta 5th Overall Vuelta a Aragón 5th Overall Escalada a Montjuich 5th Time trial, Olympic Games 6th Subida al Naranco 10th Overall Tour de France 1997 2nd Chrono des Herbiers 3rd Overall Circuit de la Sarthe 4th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 5th Subida al Naranco Clemitson, Suze (19 September 2014).
