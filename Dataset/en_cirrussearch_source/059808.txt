Gustav-Adolf Moths (born 21 September 1877 in Hamburg, date of death unknown) was a German rower who competed in the 1900 Summer Olympics. He was the coxswain with the German crew in the coxed four A semi-final, but he did not compete in the final. However the IOC medal database credits the bronze medal to him and not to Max Ammermann, who participated in the final. "Gustav-Adolf Moths". Olympedia. Retrieved 28 December 2020.
