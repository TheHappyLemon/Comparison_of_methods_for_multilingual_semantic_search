Feliciano López Díaz-Guerra (Spanish pronunciation: [feliˈθjano ˈlopeθ ˈði.aθ ˈɣera]; born 20 September 1981) is a Spanish former professional tennis player. He achieved his career-high singles ranking of world No. 12 in March 2015 and doubles ranking of world No. 9 in November 2016. In 2005, López was the first male Spanish tennis player to reach the quarterfinals of Wimbledon since 1972. He repeated the feat in 2008 and 2011. López defeated Tim Henman at the 2007 Wimbledon second round. He reached the quarterfinals of the 2015 US Open, and won his first Grand Slam title at the 2016 French Open when he won the men's doubles title with Marc López. In 2017, at the age of 35, López won the Aegon Championship at The Queen's Club, London, beating Marin Čilić in a third set tiebreak. He distinguished himself by winning his ATP titles, both in singles and doubles, on all surfaces, hard, grass and clay. During the 2018 Wimbledon Championships, López made his 66th consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearance, surpassing the previous record of 65 consecutive appearances held by Roger Federer. At the 2022 Australian Open, his record reached 79 consecutive Grand Slam appearances. As of 2022 Wimbledon, he shares the record for most Grand Slam appearances with Federer at 81. He has made 21 consecutive French Open appearances, also a record. López also holds the record for most losses on the ATP Tour, with 490. On 22 June 2021, he achieved 500 match wins at the 2021 Mallorca Championships, putting him No. 10 on the list of active players with over 500 match wins. On 13 July 2021 at the 2021 Hamburg European Open, he became the fifth player in the world to reach 10,000 aces on the most aces in career list. With his direct entry in the 2021 Indian Wells, he broke the record with his 139th participation in events in the Masters 1000 category. López is left-handed and uses a single-handed backhand. He is known for his strong serve and ability to play balls repeatedly on the baseline, and is also a confident net player and has been known to serve and volley. Unlike most Spanish players, who almost always prefer clay courts due to the popularity of that surface in their country, López is an exceptionally strong grass-court player, with three quarter-final runs at Wimbledon (his strongest Grand Slam showing), as well as 4 titles on grass at the Eastbourne International in 2013 and 2014 and at the Queen's Club Championships in 2017 and 2019. This is due in part to his more traditional playing style, which is more like grass-court legends Pete Sampras and Roger Federer than fellow Spaniards Rafael Nadal and Tommy Robredo. This traditional arsenal includes a big serve and a willingness to come into the net. In 1997, Feliciano López made his pro circuit debut in Mallorca on 29 September, losing in the second round to Dušan Vemić. In 1998, he made his ATP debut at the 1998 Open SEAT, where he lost to Jiří Novák in the first round. He then competed on the Challenger circuit, making the quarter-finals of Spain F7 and Spain F8.

He also reached one other final, losing to Réginald Willems at the Spain F7. In 2000, López competed in only his second ATP tournament at the 2000 Estoril Open, losing to Juan Antonio Marín. His performance was mediocre on the Challenger circuit, and he reached only two quarter-finals. The next year was a better one for López, as he won his second Futures event in France F3, defeating Juan Antonio Marín in the final, and reaching the final in Maia, losing to Jarkko Nieminen.

He then reached the semi-finals of the 2007 Mercedes Cup, losing to eventual champion Rafael Nadal.

López struggled after this, and at one point he suffered eight straight main-draw losses in a row. In the midst of his bad run, he won a title at the Open Castilla y León Challenger event, beating Adrian Mannarino in straight sets. At the inaugural Shanghai Masters, he advanced to his first Master Series semi-final, beating David Ferrer, Jürgen Melzer, and Robin Söderling en route. However, he retired due to a right ankle injury in his semi-final match against Rafael Nadal, trailing 1–6, 0–3. Despite his poor year on the ATP tour, López did play a key role for the Spain Davis Cup team, helping them win the 2009 Davis Cup with doubles wins in the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and finals. López started his 2010 season by playing in the 2010 Medibank International Sydney, where he lost to eventual runner-up Richard Gasquet in the first round.

López then continued his impressive grass-court form into the third Grand Slam of the year, Wimbledon. He saw off both Yūichi Sugita and Ante Pavić in straight sets in the first and second rounds, respectively. He then met John Isner in the third round. It was a match dominated by serve. López fought back from a set down to win 3 sets to 1, securing the first break of serve in the match in the penultimate game.

After a disappointing 2018 in which he failed to progress beyond the quarterfinals in any of the tournaments he played, López went through the first few months with defeats to younger opponents. His year began with a first-round loss to Jordan Thompson at the Australian Open, then continued with a loss to Denis Istomin at Delray Beach in the first round, a defeat by Alex de Minaur at the Acapulco Open, and second-round defeats to Karen Khachanov and Grigor Dimitrov at Indian Wells and Miami, respectively before finishing out the North American hard court tour with a loss to Alexander Bublik in the quarterfinals at Monterrey. The clay court season was also unfruitful with first-round losses in each of the tournaments he entered. This culminated with losses to Thomas Fabbiano in the Monte Carlo qualifying rounds, Fernando Verdasco in Barcelona, Damir Džumhur in Geneva, and Ivo Karlović at Roland Garros. The grass-court season was much more productive, as he made the round of 16 at Surbiton, losing to Ivo Karlović, then made the round of 32 at Stuttgart, losing to Lucas Pouille. He then won both the singles and doubles titles at the Queens Club Championships with a three-set singles win over Gilles Simon and a champion tie-break doubles win (partnering with Andy Murray) over Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury. At the 2021 Australian Open Lopez reached the third round for the ninth time in his career defeating Australian wildcard Li Tu and 31st seed Lorenzo Sonego in five sets. He was the oldest player to win a major match from two sets down since Ken Rosewall at the 1974 Wimbledon Championships. He also was the oldest player to reach the third round of the Australian Open since 1978. Melbourne was the 75th Grand Slam he has played in a row, having not missed one since the 2002 French Open. He lost to seventh seed Andrey Rublev. He lost in the first round at the 2021 Wimbledon Championships to 26th seed Daniel Evans but attained also a new record when he appeared in his 77th consecutive Grand Slam.

At the 2021 US Open he was eliminated in the first round by fellow countryman and qualifier Bernabé Zapata Miralles in a five set match. This was his 78th appearance in a consecutive Slam and 79th overall. As a result, he dropped out of the top 100 to No. 110 on 20 September 2021, his 40th birthday. Lopez played his 139th Masters 1000 tournament at the 2021 Indian Wells Masters. As a result, he now owns the record for the most appearances in the Masters 1000 category. During 2021 Davis Cup Finals, he represented Spanish Davis Cup team in both singles and doubles. He won both his singles matches. In the tie against Russia, aged 40, he won his tie against world number 5, Andrey Rublev, which is only the second time in Open Era history that a player aged 40+ managed to beat a top 5 player. Before Lopez, the only other 40+ player who managed to beat a top 5 ranked player was Ken Rosewall, who, at the age of 42 scored a win against Vitas Gerulaitis at 1977 Sidney Indoors. In January, at 2022 Australian Open, Feliciano lost in the first round in four sets to home favorite John Millman. It was his record 79th consecutive Grand Slam appearance and 80th overall putting him one Major away from Roger Federer’s record of 81 overall appearances. In February, he won the Mexican Open doubles tournament partnering with Stefanos Tsitsipas. He failed to qualify for the 2022 French Open ending his consecutive appearances streak at this Major, also a record of 21, and overall in Majors. At the same tournament in doubles however, he reached the third round partnering Maxime Cressy. With his participation in the 2022 Wimbledon Championships he made his 81st main draw Grand Slam appearance, equaling Roger Federer's record. He was defeated in the first round by the 21st seed Botic van de Zandschulp. Due to the ATP decision that Wimbledon will not be awarded ranking points and therefore players could not defend points from 2021, Feliciano automatically fell out of top 250, regardless of his Wimbledon result. On 1 January, Lopez announced that the 2023 season will be his last after 25 years on the tour. In February, he further stated that he would like to retire at Queen's Club, a tournament he won several times in the past, two times in singles (2017, 2019) and one time in doubles (2019), if they give him a wildcard. After receiving a main draw wildcard for the Mexican Open in Acapulco, in the first round Lopez defeated Christopher Eubanks in straight sets and scored his 504th singles career win. In the round of 16, he lost to the sixth seed Frances Tiafoe. He accepted a wildcard for the 2023 Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, for the 2023 BOSS Open. He also received a wildcard for the qualifying draw at the 2023 Queen's Club Championships. At the 2023 Mallorca Championships, his final tournament of his career, he received wildcards in singles and doubles. In doubles, paired with Stefanos Tsitsipas, they lost in the first round to the No. 1 seeds, Santiago González and Édouard Roger-Vasselin. In singles, Lopez beat Australian Max Purcell in the first round, in straight sets. After the match, according to ATP stats, his new haul of 10,261 untouched serves puts him fourth on the most aces in career list. In the second round he beat another Australian, Jordan Thompson, to reach his 93rd ATP career quarterfinal and his second quarterfinal at this tournament, previously reaching the same stage in 2021. He also became the oldest ATP quarterfinalist since 1995. In the quarterfinals, he lost to German Yannick Hanfmann, which was to be his last professional match. He completed his career with a 506-490 tour-level record, having won more matches on grass (87) than any other Spaniard. López has appeared as a model for the likes of Hugo Boss and Elle, and endorses Braun shavers and L'Oréal products. He has professed to dislike being called a model, however, and states that he wants to be seen only as a tennis player. He has been endorsed by Ellesse tennis clothing since 2016; before that, Joma was his endorser and Nike endorses his shoes. López was born in Toledo and now lives in Madrid.
