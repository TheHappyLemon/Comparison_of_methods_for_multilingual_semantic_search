Sodium superoxide is the inorganic compound with the formula NaO2. This yellow-orange solid is a salt of the superoxide anion. It is an intermediate in the oxidation of sodium by oxygen. NaO2 is prepared by treating sodium peroxide with oxygen at high pressures: Na2O2 + O2 → 2 NaO2 It can also be prepared by careful oxygenation of a solution of sodium in ammonia: Na(in NH3) + O2 → NaO2 It is also produced, along with sodium peroxide, when sodium is stored under inappropriate conditions (e.g. in dirty or partially halogenated solvents)[citation needed]. The product is paramagnetic, as expected for a salt of the O− 2 anion. It hydrolyses readily to give a mixture of sodium hydroxide, oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. It crystallizes in the NaCl motif.
