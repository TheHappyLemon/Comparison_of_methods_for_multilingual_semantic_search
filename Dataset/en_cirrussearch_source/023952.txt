August 1868 is considered to be the official date of establishment, Synelnykove was then nothing more then a train station. It was named in honor of the noble Synelnikov family, who owned these lands until the end of the 18th century. In 1896 the train station was connected to the Kursk-Kharkiv-Sevastopol railways and was officially opened on 15 November 1873. With the development of the railway Synelnykove became an important transport hub. Industry and trade began to develop in the city.
