Marcel Kint (20 September 1914, in Zwevegem – 23 March 2002, in Kortrijk) was a Belgian professional road bicycle racer who won 31 races between 1935 and 1951. His finest year was 1938 when he won the World Cycling Championship, three stages of the Tour de France and the season-long competition equivalent to today's UCI ProTour. He specialized in one-day classic cycle races and won Paris–Roubaix, Gent–Wevelgem, Paris–Brussels. He was the only three-time consecutive winner of La Flèche Wallonne until 2016 when Alejandro Valverde won his third consecutive race and fourth overall. Kints honours would have been much bigger but at his sporting peak, his career was halted for a few years by World War II. The outbreak of the war would make Marcel Kint the longest reigning world champion in the history of cycling. Kint would hold the rainbow jersey until 1946: eight years, and it could have been nine. In the final of the 1946 world championship in Zurich, Kint and Swiss rider Hans Knecht were riding to the finish, when Kint was stopped by fanatical home supporters, causing him to finish second. 1933 1st Junior National Road Race Championships 1934 1st stage 1 Tour of Belgium independents 1935 1st Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen 1st Stage 7 Tour de Luxembourg 1st Bruxelles-Liège 1st Ronde van Vlaanderen independents 1st Overall Tour of Belgium independents Grote Prijs van Zwevegem 1st Jemeppe-Marche-Jemeppe 2nd Overall Circuit Franco-Belge 1936 1st Antwerpen–Gent–Antwerpen 1st Stage 2 Tour of Belgium 4th Overall Paris–Nice 9th Overall Tour de France 1st Stage 19 1937 1st Gent–Ieper 2nd La Flèche Wallonne 2nd Paris–Lille 6th Paris–Brussels 10th Overall Paris–Nice 1938 1st Road race, World Road Championships 1st Paris–Brussels 1st GP d'Espéraza 2nd Liège–Bastogne–Liège 3rd Tour of Flanders 3rd National Road Race Championships 7th Paris–Tours 9th Overall Tour de France 1st Stages 15, 16 & 18 1939 1st Stages 8A & 18B Tour de France 1st National Road Race Championships 1st Antwerpen–Gent–Antwerpen 1st Ransart-Beaumont-Ransart 1st GP Stad Zottegem 2nd Paris–Roubaix 5th Paris–Brussels 5th Bordeaux–Paris 1939 1st Circuit de Belgique 1942 1st Gullegem Koerse 1943 1st La Flèche Wallonne 1st Paris–Roubaix 1st Ronde van Limburg 1st Brussels-Paris 1st Circuit de Belgique 5th Tour of Flanders 8th Paris–Tours 1944 1st La Flèche Wallonne 1st Grand Prix Jules Lowie 1st Grand Prix du Printemps 9th Tour of Flanders 1st Grote Prijs Beeckman-De Caluwé 1945 1st La Flèche Wallonne 1st Omloop der Vlaamse Ardennen Ichtegem 1st Dwars door West-Vlaanderen 2nd Textielprijs Vichte 1946 1st Junior National Road Race Championships Interclubs 2nd Road race, World Road Championships 2nd GP du Locle 9th Tour of Flanders 10th Paris–Roubaix 1947 1st Junior National Road Race Championships Interclubs 1949 1st Gent–Wevelgem 2nd Gullegem Koerse 2nd Textielprijs Vichte 4th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 1950 5th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 8th Overall Roma–Napoli–Roma 10th Paris–Roubaix 1951 1st Elfstedenronde 7th La Flèche Wallonne 9th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 1946 1st Prix Hourlier-Comès (with Rik Van Steenbergen) 1947 1st Six Hours of Zürich (with Rik Van Steenbergen) 1948 1st Six Days of Brussels (with Rik Van Steenbergen) 1st Trophée des Routiers (with Rik Van Steenbergen) 1949 1st Six Days of Brussels (with Rik Van Steenbergen) 2nd Six Days of Ghent (with Rik Van Steenbergen) 3nd Six Days of Paris (with Rik Van Steenbergen) "Le Palmarès de Marcel Kint".
