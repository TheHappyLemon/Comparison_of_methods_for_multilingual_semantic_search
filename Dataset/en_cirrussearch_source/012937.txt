Metso Corporation (natively Metso Oyj) is a Finnish publicly traded company that was established in 2020 when Outotec and Metso Minerals merged. The company is focusing on providing technology and services for mining, aggregates, recycling and metal refining industries. The European Commission accepted Metso's and Outotec's merger on 13 May 2020 and the company started operations on 1 July 2020. The company changed its name from Metso Outotec to Metso in May 2023. Metso's President and CEO Pekka Vauramo [fi] became the company's President and CEO. Mikael Lilius, former Chairman of the Board of Metso, is the Chairman of the Board, and Matti Alahuhta, former Chairman of the Board of Outotec, is the Deputy Chairman of the Board. The company employs a total of more than 15,000 people worldwide in more than 50 countries. In February 2023, Metso Outotec Board of Directors announced a proposal to shareholders on company name change from Metso Outotec Corporation to Metso Corporation. The grounds for the proposal were that the post-merger integration of the two companies had been completed and that the company strategy going forward focused on a strong unified company brand. Shareholder vote on the proposal was scheduled for annual general meeting on 3 May 2023. The name was changed on 4 May 2023. "Key facts". Metso Outotec. Retrieved 11 August 2020. "Metso Oyj".
