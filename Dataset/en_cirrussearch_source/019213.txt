It has about 3,900 inhabitants. It is part of the historical Hlučín Region. The village of Zábřeh is an administrative part of Dolní Benešov. Dolní Benešov is located about 14 kilometres (9 mi) east of Opava and 12 km (7 mi) northwest of Ostrava. It lies in a flat agricultural landscape in the Opava Hilly Land. It is situated near the Opava River, which forms the southern municipal border. There are two large ponds: Jezero and Nezmar. The first written mention of Benešov is from 1312, as an estate of the Benešovice noble family. In 1371, its then owner Margrave John Henry exchanged Benešov for the Drahotuš Castle near Lipník nad Bečvou with the Drahotuš family. This family owned Benešov until the late 16th century. During their rule, the village prospered and developed, and in 1493 it received town privileges by King Vladislaus II. In 1598, Benešov was illegally acquired by the Mošovský family during their re-Catholicization struggles. The town was then owned by the barons of Kalkreut in 1710–1774, by the Henneberk family in 1774–1846, and by the Rothschild family in 1846–1848. During World War II, the village was the base for a working party (E444) of British and Commonwealth prisoners of war, under the administration of Stalag VIIIB/344 at Łambinowice in Poland. In January 1945, as the Soviet armies resumed their offensive and advanced from the east, and the prisoners were marched westward in The Long March. Many of them died from the bitter cold and exhaustion. The lucky ones got far enough to the west to be liberated by the Allied armies.
