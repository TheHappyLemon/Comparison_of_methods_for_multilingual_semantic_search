Björn Nils Olof Skifs (Swedish: [ˈbjœːɳ ˈɧɪfs] ; born 20 April 1947) is a Swedish singer, songwriter, actor, and screenwriter. Björn Skifs formed his first musical group, Slam Creepers, in 1962. Slam Creepers split in 1969 and Skifs went on to form a new band, Blåblus (a farmer's or workman's shirt (blus, blouse) made from blue (blå, blue) fabric - a pun (blues)) in 1972. As the lead singer of Blue Swede (another pun - blue + suede), the band had a No. 1 hit on Billboard Hot 100 in 1974 with a cover of Mark James's "Hooked on a Feeling". Skifs embarked on a solo career after Slam Creepers broke up in 1969 and previously he had recorded the duet Med varann with Anni-Frid Lyngstad for his 1975 album Schiffz!. Skifs appeared as The Arbiter on the original studio album for Chess, released in 1984. A single and video, The Arbiter (I Know the Score), was released in 1985. Skifs also recorded several demos for the album, including One Night in Bangkok, later performed by Murray Head. Skifs did not perform the role on stage (in the original London production the character was played by Tom Jobe). Povel Ramel gave Skifs the Karamelodiktstipendiet award in 1984. Skifs has represented Sweden twice in the Eurovision Song Contest, in the 1978 contest and in the 1981 contest. In 2000, he hosted Melodifestivalen, the Swedish heat of the Eurovision Song Contest, along with nine other presenters. In 2002, he had a major hit with the song "Håll mitt hjärta" (Hold My Heart), which is a Swedish version of Peter Hallström's song Same Ol' Story. It stayed on Svensktoppen from 27 April 2003 until 8 January 2006, for a total of 142 weeks. In April 2020, Skifs performed at the Swedish live-show En kväll tillsammans, broadcast on SVT, which aimed to bring in money to the Swedish COVID-19 risk groups. Skifs performed the song "Håll Mitt Hjärta" at the end of the show. 1973 – "Sally var en reko brud" 1973 – "Hooked on a Feeling" 1973 – "Never My Love" 1973 – "Silly Milly" 1975 – "Michelangelo" 1976 – "Firefly" 1977 – "Lady" 1977 – "Tarantula" 1978 – "Det blir alltid värre framåt natten" 1978 – "Rococo rendez-vous" 1981 – "Fångad i en dröm" 1985 – "Vild och vacker" 1985 – "The Arbiter (I Know the Score)" 1991 – "Om igen" 2010 – "When You Tell the World You're Mine" with Agnes Carlsson 2011 – "Break the Spell" 2012 – "Step Right Up" 1978 – Björns bästa / Björn Skifs' Greatest Hits 1981 – Björns ballader 1989 – Collection 1990 – Björn Skifs 1991 – Songs for you 1997 – 50/50 2004 – Skifs Hits!
