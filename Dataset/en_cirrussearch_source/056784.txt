Tiilikkajärvi National Park (Finnish: Tiilikkajärven kansallispuisto) is a national park in Finland, located both in Rautavaara, North Savonia and Sotkamo, Kainuu. It was established in 1982 and covers 34 square kilometres (13 sq mi). Southern and northern natural features mix in this park forming an ecotone of forest and swamp types. The Tiilikkajärvi lake is a barren 400 ha (1.5 sq mi) lake with beaches all around it, split in the middle by esker capes. Northern bird species brambling and rustic bunting are common in the park's forests. The most common bird species of the bogs is the yellow wagtail. The Eurasian whimbrel also nests on the bogs. The barren Tiilikkajärvi lake is inhabited by the black-throated diver, and its beaches by the little ringed plover. Other species of the area include the lesser black-backed gull, capercaillie, willow grouse, bean goose, Eurasian golden plover, and the Siberian jay. In the summer of 1993, the pine grosbeak nested in the area. The beaver lives in the nearby rivers.
