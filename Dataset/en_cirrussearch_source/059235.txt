The 2002–03 UEFA Champions League was the 11th season of UEFA's premier European club football tournament, the UEFA Champions League, since its rebranding in 1992, and the 48th European Cup tournament overall. The competition was won by Milan, who beat Juventus on penalties in the European Cup's first ever all-Italian final, to win their sixth European title, and its first in nine years. Manchester United's Ruud van Nistelrooy was again the top scorer, scoring 12 goals over the two group stages and knockout stage, in addition to two goals he had scored in the qualifying phase, although his side bowed out in the quarter-finals and missed out on the chance of playing in a final at their own stadium. Real Madrid were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Juventus in the semi-finals. A total of 72 teams participated in the 2002–03 Champions League, from 48 of 52 UEFA associations (Liechtenstein organises no domestic league competition). Two lowest-ranked associations (Andorra and San Marino) were not admitted. Additionally, no teams from Azerbaijan were admitted this year as no official champion was decided in the 2001–02 season. Below is the qualification scheme for the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League: Associations 1–3 each have four teams qualify Associations 4–6 each have three teams qualify Associations 7–15 each have two teams qualify Associations 16–52 each have one team qualify (except Liechtenstein, San Marino, Andorra and Azerbaijan) Countries are allocated places according to their 2001 UEFA league coefficient, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 1996–97 to 2000–01. Since the title holders (Real Madrid) also qualified for the Champions League Third qualifying round through their domestic league, one Third qualifying round spot was vacated. Due to this, as well as due to suspension of Azerbaijan, the following changes to the default access list are made: The champions of association 16 (Scotland) are promoted from the second qualifying round to the third qualifying round. The champions of associations 26, 27 and 28 (Israel, Slovenia and Bulgaria) are promoted from the first qualifying round to the second qualifying round.

Subsequently, they were excluded from the Champions League, while Bundesliga runners-up Sturm Graz were moved from Second to Third qualifying round and Bundesliga 3rd-placed team GAK replaced Sturm in the Second qualifying round. Azerbaijan (AZE): Clubs from Azerbaijan were not admitted to UEFA competitions as the previous season was suspended in mid-April due to ongoing conflict between clubs and AFFA. Several weeks later the championship was resumed and subsequently finished by clubs independently from the federation. Shamkir won the league, but this title is not recognized by both UEFA and AFFA.
