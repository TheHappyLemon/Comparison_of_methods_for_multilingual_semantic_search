Debica is the county's only rail junction, from which lines emerge in three directions – eastwards to Rzeszow, westwards to Tarnow and northwards to Mielec. The west–east line, which goes from Wrocław via Debica, to Przemyśl, is electrified and is regarded as one of the most important rail connections in Poland. The line to Mielec, which goes further northwards to Tarnobrzeg and Sandomierz, is of secondary importance and is not electrified. The county is conveniently located along the longest route in Europe, E40. Also, in Pilzno, the E40 road crosses with Polish national main road number 73, which goes from Kielce to Jasło. GUS.
