Dolní Kounice (Czech pronunciation: [ˈdolɲiː ˈkouɲɪtsɛ]; German: Kanitz) is a town in Brno-Country District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 2,600 inhabitants. Dolní Kounice is located about 16 kilometres (10 mi) southwest of Brno. It lies in the Bobrava Highlands. The highest point is at 335 m (1,099 ft) above sea level. The town is situated in the valley of the Jihlava River. The first written mention of Kounice is from 1183, when the Premonstratensian Rosa coeli convent was built here. It was founded in 1181 and was the oldest convent in Moravia. A church already stood here in 1183. In 1284–1330, a Gothic castle was built by the convent on a hill above the village. Since the 15th century, the village has been named Dolní Kounice. In 1527, the convent was abolished. An attempt was made to restore it in 1702, but a year later it was destroyed by a fire and never restored again. From 1537, the estate was owned by various noble families. In 1571, Dolní Kounice was promoted to a town and obtained coat of arms. During the rule of the Drnovský of Drnovice family in 1588–1622, the castle was rebuilt into a Renaissance fortified residence. During the Thirty Years' War in 1622, the castle was burned down, and was repaired in 1682 in the Baroque style. From 1622 to 1862, Dolní Kounice Castle with the estate was property of the Dietrichstein family, which was its most famous and longest owners. In 1964, Dolní Kounice lost the title a town. The title was returned to it in 1998. Dolní Kounice is known for the Gothic-Renaissance castle and for ruins of the convent. The castle is gradually being repaired and since 2007 has been open to the public. The Church of Saints Peter and Paul on the town square is a neo-Renaissance structure from 1877–1879.
