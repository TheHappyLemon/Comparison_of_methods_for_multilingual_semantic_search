Joe Biden assumed office as President of the United States on January 20, 2021. The president has the authority to nominate members of his Cabinet to the United States Senate for confirmation under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution. Before confirmation and during congressional hearings, a high-level career member of an executive department heads this pre-confirmed cabinet on an acting basis. The Cabinet's creation was part of the transition of power following the 2020 United States presidential election. In addition to the 15 heads of executive departments, there are 10 Cabinet-level officials. Biden altered his cabinet structure, elevating the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and ambassador to the United Nations as Cabinet-level positions. Biden initially removed the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from his Cabinet, but reversed the move in July 2023. Confirmations had occurred at the slowest pace of any presidential cabinet in modern history that resulted from delays in facilitating an orderly transition of power and passing the organizing resolution for governing an evenly split Senate following the 2020–2021 United States Senate runoff elections in Georgia; and the second impeachment of Donald Trump. By March 2021, a pick-up in the first half of the month brought confirmations close to pace. Biden is the first president since Ronald Reagan in 1981 to have all of his original Cabinet secretary nominees confirmed to their posts. This page documents the confirmation process for Cabinet nominees of the Biden administration. They are listed according to the United States order of precedence. All permanent members of the Cabinet of the United States as heads of executive departments require the advice and consent of the United States Senate following appointment by the president before taking office. The vice presidency is exceptional in that the position requires an election to office pursuant to the United States Constitution. The president may also designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as Cabinet-level members of the Cabinet. The Cabinet meets with the president in the Cabinet Room, a room adjacent to the Oval Office. The following have been named as Cabinet appointees by the president of the United States. Below is a list of confirmations for Cabinet positions, Cabinet-level positions, and other significant positions that were approved through the Senate from January 2021 onwards, by a recorded roll-call vote, rather than by a voice vote. After final passage, Austin's waiver to serve as Secretary of Defense was signed into law by President Biden on January 22, 2021. Due to the tied vote in committee, a discharge petition was required to bring Becerra's nomination to the floor, which passed 51–48 on March 11, 2021. Committee votes scheduled for February 24, 2021, were cancelled that day, prior to withdrawal. Burns was elevated to the Cabinet on July 21, 2023. On November 7, 2020, it was announced that Democrat Joe Biden defeated the incumbent president, Donald Trump, in the 2020 presidential election. Joe Biden received 306 electoral votes compared to Trump's 232 electoral votes, with 270 needed to win the presidency. He assumed office on January 20, 2021. Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) was elected vice president of the United States, receiving 306 electoral votes, compared to the incumbent vice president, Mike Pence, who received 232 electoral votes. An elected vice president does not require Senate confirmation, and the vice president does not serve at the president's pleasure. Having assumed office on January 20, 2021, she is the first female vice president of the United States as well as the first African American and Asian American to hold the second-highest office. The following cabinet positions are listed in order of their creation (also used as the basis for the United States presidential line of succession).
