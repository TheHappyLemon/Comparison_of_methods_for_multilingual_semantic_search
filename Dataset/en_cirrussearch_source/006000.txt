The unicolored jay (Aphelocoma unicolor) is an Aphelocoma jay native to cloud forests of northwestern Central America and southern and southeastern Mexico, from central Honduras west to central Guerrero, southern Veracruz and extreme southern San Luis Potosí. It is apparently a basal member of its genus (Rice et al. 2003). At Montebello, Chiapas, it is a cooperative breeder (Webber and Brown 1994), and is not known to perform mating dances. A. u. guerrerensis has an especially large bill and long tail. Its feathers are bluish-purple. A. u. concolor has pale blue plumage. A. u.oaxacae has dark blue plumage. Its wing, tail and tarsus are relatively short. A. u. unicolor A. u. griscomi Rice, Nathan H.; Martínez-Meyer, Enrique & Peterson, A.
