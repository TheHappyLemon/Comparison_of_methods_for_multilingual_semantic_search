It has the pressurised cargo module removed to accommodate Poisk. It was similar to the Progress M-SO1 spacecraft which was used to deliver the Pirs module to the station in 2001. Progress M-MIM2 and Poisk were launched by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The launch occurred at 14:22 GMT on 10 November 2009. At launch, Progress M-MIM2 had a total mass of 7,102 kilograms (15,657 lb), including the 3,670-kilogram (8,090 lb) Poisk module. The spacecraft docked with the zenith port of the International Space Station's Zvezda module on 12 November. Capture occurred at 15:41 GMT, and initial docking was completed successfully at 15:44. At 00:16 GMT on 8 December, Progress M-MIM2 was undocked from Poisk, and at 04:48 GMT its engines ignited to begin a 38-second deorbit burn. It reentered the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean at 05:27, and had broken up by 05:32.
