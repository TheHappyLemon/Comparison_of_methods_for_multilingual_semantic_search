Lithuania competed at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Netherlands. After the disappointing debut in the 1924 Summer Olympics, Lithuania was better prepared for the games in Amsterdam. In 1926 it organized the first national Olympics (Lithuanian: Lietuvos sporto šventė). Lithuania sent 12 athletes to compete in 4 sports: athletics, boxing, cycling, and weightlifting. The best result was achieved by boxer Juozas Vinča, who shared 5th–8th places. Lithuania did not appear in the Olympics again until after the restoration of independence in 1992. Haris Šveminas (credited as H. Schwemminas in the official report) competed in men's 100 m and 200 m events. In 100 metres he finished 5th in 12th heat of the first round and did not advance to the semifinals. He shared 63–71 places among 75 competitors. In 200 metres Šveminas was third in the 9th heat, but that was also not enough to advance. In this event he shared 31–44 places among 59 competitors. Julius Petraitis competed in men's 5,000 m event. He was tenth in 2nd heat and did not advance. Adolfas Akelaitis jumped 160 cm in men's high jump and took the last place. Viktoras Ražaitis competed in men's javelin throw. His result (51.16 metres) secured him 26th place among 28 competitors. Paulina Radziulytė became the first woman to represent Lithuania in the Olympics. She competed in women's 800 metres. She placed last in the 3rd heat and 23rd–24th overall among 25 athletes. She was also registered for 100 metres, but did not enter the competition.

Vinča won the first match against Robert Foquet from France and advanced to the quarterfinals. He was then knocked out by Donald McCorkindale from South Africa and eliminated from further competition. Vinča thus shared 5th–8th places with boxers from Canada, Ireland, and Great Britain. Markevičius lost his first game to Georges Carcagne from France and did not advance in the competition.
