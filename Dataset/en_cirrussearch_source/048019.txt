Ranheim Fotball is a Norwegian football club from Ranheim in Trondheim that currently plays in 1. divisjon, the second tier in the Norwegian football league system. Ranheim is the football department of Ranheim IL, founded on 17 February 1901. In early years, Ranheim played in the Norwegian top flight in the seasons; 1937–38, 1938–39, 1939–40 and 1947–48, as well as in the seasons; 1949–50, 1952–53, 1954–55 and 1955–56. Since 2006, Ranheim has acted as a farm club for Rosenborg, where the goal has been to establish a football team from Trøndelag in the 1. divisjon. Ranheim came close to qualifying in 2007 and 2008. Former manager Per Joar Hansen earned Ranheim a promotion to the 1. divisjon after the 2009 season. They played their first 6 home matches at Abrahallen, and on 10 July 2010, they moved to their new stadium, EXTRA Arena. Ranheim finished 5th in the 2010 1. divisjon and qualified for the promotion play-offs for a place in the Tippeligaen. In the 2017 season, Ranheim gained promotion to the top level for the first time since 1955–56 after beating Sogndal. Over two legs, they first lost 1–0 away and went on to win 1–0 at home. After two scoreless periods of extra time they secured promotion by winning 5–4 on penalties.
