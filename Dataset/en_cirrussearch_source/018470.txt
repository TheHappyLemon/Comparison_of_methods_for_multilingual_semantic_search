In 1566 it was granted Magdeburg rights by the King Sigismund I the Old. Eighteen years later, Stanislaw Herburt built a castle here, the town also had a printing shop, where in 1612 the Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae (The Annals of Jan Długosz) were published. Until the Partitions of Poland (1772), Dobromil was part of Przemyśl Land, Ruthenian Voivodeship. In the course of time, the branch of the Herburt family which resided in the town changed its name into Dobromilski. In 1772, Dobromil was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and until 1918 belonged to Austrian Galicia. After World War I, the town returned to Poland, and in the Second Polish Republic, was the seat of a county in Lwów Voivodeship. In 1921, its population was 5386. Following the Nazi and Soviet Invasion of Poland (September 1939), Dobromil was transferred to the Soviet Union. In June 1941, Soviet NKVD murdered here hundreds of prisoners (see NKVD prisoner massacres). Under German occupation, Dobromil was transferred to Przemyśl County, District of Kraków, General Government. Its Jewish population was murdered in The Holocaust, and on August 8, 1944 the town was seized by the Red Army. Currently, Dobromil belongs to Ukraine. The town has a local office of the Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land.

The raion was abolished in July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Lviv Oblast to seven.
