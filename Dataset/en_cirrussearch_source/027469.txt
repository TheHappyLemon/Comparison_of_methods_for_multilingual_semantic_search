The Sarikol Range (Russian: Сарыкольский хребет; Chinese: 萨雷阔勒岭, 色勒库尔山脉; Tajik: Рашти Куҳи Сариқӯл) is a mountain range in the Pamirs on the border of Tajikistan and the People's Republic of China. The name Sarikol has also been used to describe the local people who are historically known as Sarikolis; the local Sarikoli language and Tashkurgan Town, which was historically known as Sarikol. The range divides Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province and China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and it runs parallel with the Muztagh Range to the east. The range extends 346 kilometres (215 mi) from the Markansu River in the north to the Beyik Pass in the south. Its average elevation is roughly 5,000 metres (16,500 ft) and the highest point in the range is Mount Lyavirdyr at 6,351 m (20,837 ft). On the Tajik part of the range there are 240 glaciers with a total area of 144 km2. The range's drainage basin feeds both the Amu Darya and Tarim River. The range is composed of schist, granite and gneiss.
