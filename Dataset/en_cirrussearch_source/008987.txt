Butigeidis (Budikid; Belarusian: Будзікід; died 1290 or 1291) was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1285 to 1290 or 1291. He assumed power after the death of Daumantas. He is the first known and undisputed member of the Gediminids. He started his rule when the Livonian Order and the Teutonic Knights were finalizing their conquest of the Baltic tribes. In 1289, leading about 8,000 troops, Butigeidis attacked Sambia. In 1289 the Teutonic Knights built a castle in Tilsit and their raids intensified. Lithuanians were forced to abandon Kolainių Castle located on the other bank of the Neman River. Butigeidis was the first to build strong castles along the Neman River. The castle system was further developed after his death and helped to resist the raids until the second half of the 14th century. Butigeidis transferred Vawkavysk to Galicia-Volhynia in exchange for peace. He died in 1290 or 1292, and his brother Butvydas (also known as Pukuveras) inherited the crown.
