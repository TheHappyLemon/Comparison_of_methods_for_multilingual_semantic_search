The 2032 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as UEFA Euro 2032 or simply Euro 2032, will be the 19th UEFA European Championship, the quadrennial international football championship organised by UEFA for the senior men's national teams of its member associations. Italy and Turkey will host the tournament, which is scheduled to take place between June and July 2032. It will be the fourth time that European Championship matches are played in Italy, who previously hosted the 1968 and 1980 tournaments as well as matches of the 2020 tournament in Rome, while it will be the first time that matches are held in Turkey. On 28 April 2022, UEFA announced that three bids, Italy, Turkey and Russia (which was later deemed to be ineligible), had announced their intentions to host the tournament. On 4 October 2023, Turkey officially withdrew from bidding for the 2028 tournament in order to focus on a joint bid with Italy for Euro 2032. Having been unopposed in their bid, the two nations were announced as hosts of Euro 2032 on 10 October 2023 in Nyon, Switzerland. As co-hosts, Italy and Turkey qualified for the tournament automatically. The remaining spots will be determined by a qualifying tournament. Bold indicates champion for that year. Italic indicates host for that year. Italy and Turkey could bring their prior appearances up to respectively 12 and 7 if they qualify for UEFA Euro 2028. On 12 April 2023, both Italian Football Federation and Turkish Football Federation submitted their lists of 10 proposed venues, when they were separate bids. Since the bid became a joint one, each country will instead select five stadiums for the final tournament. The selection of the ten stadiums for five in one country each will be decided in October 2026. "UEFA EURO 2032 – Invitation to bid". UEFA Circular Letter. No. 87/2021.
