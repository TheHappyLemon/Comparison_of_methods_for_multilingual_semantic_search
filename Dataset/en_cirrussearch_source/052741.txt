Construction of the statue began in 1957 in honor of the 400th anniversary of Bashkortostan's entry into the Russian Empire. The statue opened to the public on 7 August 1965 with an official ceremony. At the base of the monument are bronze sculptures of two women who sit on either side of the stela, half turned towards each other. The sculptures are allegories of Russia and Bashkortostan and both hold laurel wreaths as a symbol of peace. The monument is inscribed with the years "1557 - 1957" and the following in Russian and Bashkir: СЛАВА ВЕЛИКОЙ БРАТСКОЙ ДРУЖБЕ РУССКОГО И БАШКИРСКОГО НАРОДОВ РУС ҺӘМ БАШҠОРТ ХАЛЫҠТАРЫНЫҢ БӨЙӨК ТУҒАНЛЫҠ ДУҪЛЫҒЫНА ДАН (English: GLORY TO THE GREAT BROTHERLY FRIENDSHIP OF THE RUSSIAN AND BASHKIR PEOPLES) The 400th anniversary of Bashkiria's accession into the Russian Empire was celebrated in 1957.
