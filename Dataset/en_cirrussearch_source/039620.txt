Sing (Hungarian: Mindenki, meaning "Everybody") is a 2016 Hungarian short film directed and written by Kristóf Deák. Set in 1991, it follows the story of a girl who moves to a new elementary school and becomes a member of the award-winning school choir. In 2017, the film won the Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film at the 89th Academy Awards. The story takes place in Budapest in 1991. Zsófi (Dorka Gáspárfalvi) moves to a new elementary school and becomes friends with Liza (Dorottya Hais). Zsófi joins the award-winning school choir but she is told not to sing out loud because Erika, the teacher, doesn't consider her good enough and the choir is preparing for a competition where they can win a trip to Sweden. Zsófi is visibly hurt, but she obeys the teacher and keeps her request secret from the other children. Liza notices that Zsófi doesn't sing, and Zsófi tells her about the teacher's request. At the next choir rehearsal Liza confronts the teacher, but she is told that it's in the best interest of the choir that only the good singers sing out loud. Erika also tells Liza that she didn't want to publicly shame those who can't sing well, but now she asks all of them to raise their hands. Zsófi is surprised when she realizes that she was far from being the only one who wasn't allowed to sing. Later she tells Liza she has a plan. The day of the competition arrives. Erika's choir is supposed to start singing, and all the children start silently mouthing the lyrics, no one sings. When a frustrated Erika leaves the stage, the children start to sing.
