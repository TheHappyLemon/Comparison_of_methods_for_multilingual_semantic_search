In 2022, McMann was inducted to the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as a Distinguished Member. McMann announced in late 2010 that she had signed a three-fight contract with Strikeforce. She planned to fight at 135 pounds. However, she did not sign on with the promotion due to an extension clause in the contract. McMann was first scheduled to make her professional mixed martial arts debut on November 14, 2010 in Jamaica, but the event was cancelled due to safety problems with the cage. She then had more fights fall apart after opponents backed out, including a scheduled April 30, 2011 fight against Mariah Johnson.

In February 2013, McMann officially joined the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). It was rumored she turned down a fight with then-title holder Ronda Rousey. However, this was false information and no such fight was offered or even presented to McMann at the time. She became the third female to earn a victory in the UFC by defeating Sheila Gaff at UFC 159. McMann was slated to face former Strikeforce champion Sarah Kaufman on August 28, 2013 at UFC Fight Night 27. However, McMann withdrew from the bout for, at the time, undisclosed personal reasons. In January 2015, she disclosed that the reason for withdrawing was due to her father battling aggressive lymphoma. McMann faced Ronda Rousey for the UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship at UFC 170. She lost the fight by TKO after getting knocked down with a knee to the body. This stoppage created controversy, with many sports writers and attendants finding it premature.

McMann faced Marion Reneau on February 24, 2018 at UFC on Fox 28. After dominating the first round, McMann was knocked down and submitted by Reneau in the second round.

McMann was scheduled to face Aspen Ladd on August 13, 2022, at UFC on ESPN 41. However, Ladd was tested positive for COVID-19 and she was forced to withdraw from the event, and they were rescheduled for UFC Fight Night 210 on September 17. At the weigh-ins, Ladd weighed in at 138 pounds, two pounds over the bantamweight non-title fight limit. As a result the bout was scrapped. The cancelled bout against Ladd was counted as her last bout of her contract and she was paid her show money, with McMann now being a free agent and exploring potential possibilities. On December 27, 2022, it was announced that McMann had signed with the Bellator MMA. McMann made her promotional debut against Arlene Blencowe on April 21, 2023 at Bellator 294. She won the bout via unanimous decision. McMann faced Leah McCourt on October 7, 2023 at Bellator 300. She lost the fight via ground and pound TKO in the first round.

She traveled to Sri Lanka with Olympic teammates to help victims of the tsunami rebuild homes for those displaced by the tidal wave. She also helps with youth clubs and speaks to upcoming girls and boys about wrestling. On September 3, 2004, while driving her Jeep in Colorado on the way to Iowa with her fiance, former ASU three-time NCAA All-American wrestler Steven Blackford as her passenger, the vehicle ran off the road and rolled over. He was ejected from the vehicle, and died at the scene. McMann was hospitalized with a broken arm and minor injuries, and later charged with careless driving.

On May 30, 2018, McMann announced on social media that she and her partner Chad Bingham were expecting a child, and that she had put her career in mixed martial arts on hold.
