Kamehameha I established the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1795 after conquering most of the Hawaiian Islands. In 1810, Kaumualiʻi became a vassal of Kamehameha I, who therefore emerged as the sole sovereign of the island chain of Hawaiʻi. His dynasty lasted until 1872, and his Kingdom lasted until 1893, when Queen Liliʻuokalani, of the Kalākaua dynasty, was deposed by the pro-United States led overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. The monarchy was officially ended on January 24, 1895, when Liliʻuokalani formally abdicated in response to an attempt to restore the royal government. On November 23, 1993, the Congress passed Public Law 103-150, also known as the Apology Resolution, acknowledging the American role in the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. President Bill Clinton signed the joint resolution the same day. Biography portal Hawaii portal Politics portal House of Keoua House of Kawānanakoa List of governors of Hawaii Roger S.
