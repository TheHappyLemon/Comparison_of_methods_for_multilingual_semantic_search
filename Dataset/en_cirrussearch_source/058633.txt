Ross Stein is a scientist emeritus at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California, and cofounder and CEO of Temblor, a startup intended to teach seismic hazards and reduce their risk. Stein graduated magna cum laude from Brown University in 1975, received a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1980 and was an Observatory Post-Doctoral Fellow at Columbia University in 1981. Stein appeared in the Emmy award-nominated documentary, Killer Quake (NOVA, 1995); the four-part Great Quakes series (Discovery Channel, 1997–2001); Earthquake Storms (BBC, 2003); and the IMAX film, Forces of Nature (National Geographic Society, 2004), which he helped to write and animate. Forces was awarded best feature film of the 2004 Large Format Cinema Association Film Festival, best film and best educational film of the 2005 Giant Screen Theater Association, and Grand Prize of the 2005 La Géode International Large Format Film Festival.
