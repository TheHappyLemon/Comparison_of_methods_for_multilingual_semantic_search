Randi Criner Miller (born November 3, 1983) is an American wrestler, who competed in the 63Â kg weight class at the 2008 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal. She has now made a transition to mixed martial arts. Miller was scheduled to make her mixed martial arts debut on August 29, 2010, in Tokyo, Japan, against Hiroko Yamanaka. Miller withdrew from the fight because she was worried she was not ready to make her pro debut. Miller's fight with Yamanaka was later announced for Jewels 11th Ring on December 17, 2010, but was officially cancelled again on December 6. Miller made her MMA debut against Mollie Ahlers-Estes at Invicta Fighting Championships 1 on April 28, 2012. She won the fight via TKO in the third round.
