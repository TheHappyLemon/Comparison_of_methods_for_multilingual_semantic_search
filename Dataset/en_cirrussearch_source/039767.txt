The 2017–18 Ligue 1 season, also known as Ligue 1 Conforama for sponsorship reasons, was the 80th season since its establishment. The season started on 4 August 2017 and ended on 19 May 2018. Monaco were the defending champions. On 15 April, Paris Saint-Germain won their seventh Ligue 1 title with five games to spare following a 7–1 victory over Monaco. Twenty teams competed in the league, with three promoted teams from Ligue 2: Strasbourg (Ligue 2 champions, after a nine-year absence), Amiens (Ligue 2 runner-up, their first ever Ligue 1) and Troyes (winner of the relegation play-off against Lorient, with immediate return), replacing the three relegated teams from the 2016–17 Ligue 1 season: Bastia (finished 20th, after five years), Nancy (finished 19th, with immediate return) and Lorient (lost the relegation play-off against Troyes, after 11 years). This season was also the first since the 2010-11 season to not feature a team from the island of Corsica.
