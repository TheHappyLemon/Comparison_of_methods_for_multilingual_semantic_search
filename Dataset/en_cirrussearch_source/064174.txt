AllMusic gave the mixtape 1.5 out of 5 stars and criticized that "The resulting project isn't devoid of quality, but it is devoid of feeling. A sharper pen game and some personal tales might give the project some much-needed personality, but for now, it does little to differentiate Lone." He also picked "Turnin Up" ("A camera-flash masterwork of bouncing synths") and the airy "Crystal Castles" the best tracks of the mixtape. Ian Hassan from SheeshMedia stated: "This entire album is hypnotizing, and I can't wait to hear it at shows. This is one of the more energetic projects to release this year, and I can't wait to see how he continues to innovate his music to new levels."
