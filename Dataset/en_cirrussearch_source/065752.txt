He had a hand in the game-winning goal as his overhead kick was turned into the net by Romelu Lukaku. In the 2021–22 season, Sevilla went on to have one of the strongest defenses in La Liga and across Europe's top leagues, with Diego Carlos' leadership at centre-back being cited as one of the reasons for this.
