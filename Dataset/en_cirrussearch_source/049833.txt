North Macedonia has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 21 times since its official debut in 1998. The country had attempted to participate in 1996, but failed to qualify from the audio-only qualifying round. The current Head of Delegation is Meri Popova. Prior to 2019, North Macedonia's best result was a 12th-place finish with Elena Risteska in 2006. Having qualified from the semi-final round only once in ten of the previous eleven contests (2008‚Äì18), North Macedonia achieved its best result to date in 2019, when Tamara Todevska qualified and finished in seventh place in the final after winning the jury vote. Prior to declaring independence in 1991, as a constituent country of SFR Yugoslavia, the Socialist Republic of Macedonia participated in the Yugoslav pre-selection called among the other Yugoslav federal units. Also, Macedonian composers wrote songs for candidates from other parts of Yugoslavia. However, the Macedonian entries never managed to win, and the SR Macedonia was the only federal state never to send a Yugoslav entry to the Eurovision Song Contest. An exception occurred when Maja Od≈æaklievska won the Yugoslav competition in 1980, but she did not perform in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980 due to the Yugoslavian decision not to participate that year. The country submitted its first entry, "Samo ti" (–°–∞–º–æ —Ç–∏) sung by Kaliopi, for the 1996 edition. However, the country failed to qualify through the non-broadcast pre-selection round. Its efforts to enter the contest were again hindered in 1997, when another new system was introduced where countries with the lowest average scores over the previous four years were excluded from participating. The country made its debut in 1998, with Vlado Janevski's "Ne zori, zoro". The country's best result before 2019 (and the best result with its old name) was in 2006, when Elena Risteska sang "Ninanajna" (–ù–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∞—ò–Ω–∞) in Athens, Greece and came 12th. It is the only country to have qualified from every semi-final from 2004 to 2007 (other countries have qualified for every final but due to them finishing in the top 10 the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-final). Despite never finishing in the top 10, their record of qualifying for every final was broken in 2008, when the jury vote used in the semi-final chose Sweden as a finalist, despite Tamara, Vrƒçak and Adrian having come 10th in the televote. Macedonian Radio Television (MRT), which broadcasts the event, has intermittently used the Skopje Fest to select the national entry since the country's debut, although it made several changes in the national final format, so the 2004, 2005 and 2006 national finals were organised outside the Skopje Fest. For 2019, the country competed for the first time under the name North Macedonia. MRT selected Tamara Todevska as their act of choice, performing the song "Proud". The song managed to qualify through the second semi-final, and reached seventh place in the final, winning the jury vote. This is the first top ten placing as well as the highest placing ever for North Macedonia in the history of the contest. Following two non-qualifications in 2021 and 2022, MRT confirmed its absence in the 2023 contest, citing financial constraints. However, MRT still broadcast the 2023 contest with a view to return in 2024. The broadcaster's intention to return was stated in a budget plan published in September 2023. However, in late October 2023, the programme planning chair of MRT, Smilka Janeska Sarkanjac, clarified that a decision was yet to be made and the plan was still awaiting the approval of the government. North Macedonia ultimately did not appear on the final list of participants. From 1961 until 1991, North Macedonia competed as part of Yugoslavia. To≈°e Proeski in Istanbul (2004) Karolina Goƒçeva in Helsinki (2007) Tamara, Vrƒçak and Adrian in Belgrade (2008) Next Time in Moscow (2009) Vlatko Ilievski in D√ºsseldorf (2011) Esma Red≈æepova and Vlatko Lozanoski in Malm√∂ (2013) Tijana in Copenhagen (2014) Daniel Kajmakoski in Vienna (2015) Kaliopi in Stockholm (2016) Jana Burƒçeska in Kyiv (2017) Eye Cue in Lisbon (2018) Tamara Todevska in Tel Aviv (2019) Vasil in Rotterdam (2021) Andrea in Turin (2022) North Macedonia in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest Presented until 2018 as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R. Macedonia). In order to reduce the number of participating countries at the 1996 event a qualifying round was held among all countries except the hosts. Macedonia failed to progress from this round; entries which failed to progress have subsequently been discounted by the EBU and do not feature as part of the countries' list of appearances. In 2008 and 2009 the top nine countries in each semi-final as determined by televoting qualified automatically, with the tenth place determined based on the votes of the back-up juries among the remaining countries. This resulted in Sweden and Finland advancing to the final instead of Macedonia in 2008 and 2009 respectively. The 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
