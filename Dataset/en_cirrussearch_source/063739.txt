Thinopyrum junceum, commonly named sand couch-grass, is a species of grass in the family Poaceae. It is found in Europe and temperate Asia, and grows from rhizomes. They have a self-supporting growth form and simple, broad leaves. Individuals can grow to 52 cm tall. A relative of wheat, Thinopyrum junceum is salt-tolerant. A hybridization of the two creates a salt-tolerant wheat variety. "Thinopyrum junceum (L.) Á.Löve | Plants of the World Online | Kew Science". Plants of the World Online. Retrieved 2022-07-12.
