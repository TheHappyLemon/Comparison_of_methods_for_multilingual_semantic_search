Douala International Airport (French: Aéroport international Douala) (IATA: DLA, ICAO: FKKD) is an international airport located in Douala, the largest city in Cameroon and the capital of Cameroon's Littoral Region. With its 4 terminals and an average of 1.5 million passengers and 50,000 tonnes of freight per year it is the country's busiest airport. The airport is managed and partly owned (34%) by the company Aeroport du Cameroon (ADC) which also manages all other 13 airports on Cameroonian soil. Douala Airport has a single runway, 12/30, with a length of 2,880 m (9,448 ft). Between 1 and 21 March 2016, the runway was closed for upgrade works; all airlines switched operations to Yaoundé Airport during that period. This formed part of a renovation plan of 20 billion CFA (US$36,363,636 million), financed by the French Agency of Development, which targeted a two-stage renovation: first the airport's runway, and then its terminals and interior.
