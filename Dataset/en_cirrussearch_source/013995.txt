The Sacred Heart Cathedral (Latvian: Rēzeknes Vissvētākās Jēzus Sirds Romas katoļu katedrāle), the cathedral of the Diocese of Rezekne-Aglona, is located in Rēzekne, Latvia. On the site occupied by the church, there existed a wooden temple built in 1685 by Franciszek Jan Bieliński [pl]. The church burned down in 1887 during a storm and the following year the works for the new and present neo-Romanesque style church began. Construction was completed in 1902 under the guidance of Florian Viganovskis, dedicated in 1904, and consecrated in 1914. The church was elevated to a cathedral status on December 2, 1995 with the Ad aptius consulendum bula of Pope John Paul II, when the Diocese of Rezekne-Aglona was created.
