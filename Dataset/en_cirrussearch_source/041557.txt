Rostov Arena (Russian: «Ростов Арена») is an association football stadium in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. It was one of the venues for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. It also hosts FC Rostov of the Russian Premier League, replacing Olimp – 2. It has a capacity of 45,000 spectators. In June 2013, during the groundbreaking for the stadium, five shells from WWII were found, almost perfectly preserved. In August 2013, work began on the sandy alluvium foundation for the stadium. Work on the foundation was completed in May 2014. Construction commenced on the stadium substructure in October 2015. In December the construction site began to bring in heavy equipment and construction materials. In January 2015, crews began driving piles. In March 2015, the stadium project was revised, reducing the cost of construction to 3 billion rubles. In the summer of 2015 pile driving was completed and superstructure construction began. In December 2015, work began on the installation of the metal roof frame. In July 2016 work on the concrete stadium bowl began.
