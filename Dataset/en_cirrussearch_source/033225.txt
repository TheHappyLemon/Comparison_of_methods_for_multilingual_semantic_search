Vladimir Andreyevich Savon (Ukrainian: Володи́мир Андрійович Саво́н; 26 September 1940 – 1 June 2005) was a Ukrainian chess player. He was awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE in 1973. Savon shared the Ukrainian Chess Championship in 1969 and won the USSR Championship in 1971. He competed in the 1972 Chess Olympiad. Born in Chernihiv, he learned how to play at the age of 13. Savon competed in the Soviet championship eleven times, from 1961 (at age 21) to the last championship in 1991. His best result was his first place in the 1971 championship with an undefeated 15/21. Only an international master, he finished 1.5 points ahead of former world champions Mikhail Tal and Vasily Smyslov. Future world champion Anatoly Karpov finished another half point back. Taimanov and Bernard Cafferty, in their book on the Soviet championships, described Savon's win "the least plausible result for decades". One possible factor was the distraction of Fischer's Candidates matches. It was claimed that Fischer's 6–0 wins against Larsen and Taimanov had hypnotised the top Soviet players, who were now following Petrosian's similar demise in the Candidates match that was to finish only days after this tournament. Savon's next-best result in the Soviet championship came the following year, when he tied for 3rd–5th and qualified for the Interzonal. He did, however, achieve other good results in international competition; at Debrecen in 1970 (1st= with Bilek), at Sukhumi 1972 (2nd after Tal), at Vilnius 1975 (1st=), at Portorož 1977 (2nd= with Hort, after Larsen) and at Kyiv 1978 (2nd=). FIDE awarded Savon the International Master title in 1967, and the International Grandmaster title in 1973. In the latter year, he finished eighth out of 18 at the Petropolis Interzonal. He shared the title of Ukrainian Champion with Gennady Kuzmin in 1969. In 1980 while at a chess tournament at Dnepropetrovsk, Savon suffered a serious head injury. It has led to a significant decline in his playing strength. He died in Kharkiv at the age of 65. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
