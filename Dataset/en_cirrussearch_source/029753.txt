Daniel Teklehaimanot Girmazion (Tigrinya: ዳንኤል ተክለሃይማኖት ግርማጽዮን, Tigrinya pronunciation: [tɐklɐhaymanot]; born 10 November 1988) is a professional road racing cyclist from Eritrea, who last rode for UCI Professional Continental team Cofidis. Daniel was a member of the UCI's World Cycling Centre training program before signing for the new Australian cycling team GreenEDGE in 2012. Whilst at the World Cycling Centre he was diagnosed with tachycardia, which was corrected by surgery in early 2009. He returned to riding in May of that year and went on to finish sixth overall in that year's Tour de l'Avenir. In 2010 he rode as a trainee for Cervélo TestTeam. The same year, he won the African Championships in the road race, individual time trial and team time trial, at both senior and under-23 levels. On the 2010–11 UCI Africa Tour, he won the Tour du Rwanda and the Kwita Izina Cycling Tour. He participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics being the first Eritrean competing in a sport other than athletics; he finished the road race in the 73rd position. In 2012, he became the first Eritrean to ride in the Vuelta a España, one of the 3 grand tours; he finished the race 146th overall. Daniel joined MTN–Qhubeka for the 2014 season, on a two-year contract. In 2015, at the Critérium du Dauphiné, he won the first World Tour jersey in MTN–Qhubeka's history by taking the mountains competition. He was named in the start list for the 2015 Tour de France. In July of the year, Daniel also became the first rider from an African team to wear the polka dot jersey at the Tour de France. In 2016, he again won the mountains classification at the Critérium du Dauphiné. He was named in the start list for the 2017 Giro d'Italia where he briefly held the Mountains Classification jersey. His final race with Dimension Data was the 2017 Tour of Guangxi. 2007 8th Road race, All-Africa Games 9th Road race, African Road Championships 2008 (1 pro win) 1st Road race, National Road Championships African Road Championships 5th Time trial 8th Road race 5th Overall Tour Ivoirien de la Paix 2009 2nd Overall Tour of Eritrea 1st Stages 1 & 3 6th Overall Tour de l'Avenir 2010 (2) African Road Championships 1st Road race 1st Time trial 1st Team time trial 1st Overall Tour du Rwanda 1st Stage 2 1st Stage 2 Coupe des nations Ville Saguenay 2011 (3) African Road Championships 1st Time trial 1st Team time trial National Road Championships 1st Time trial 2nd Road race 1st Overall Kwita Izina Cycling Tour 1st Stages 1, 2 & 3 1st Stage 5 Tour d'Algérie 5th Overall La Tropicale Amissa Bongo 1st Stage 4 2012 (3) African Road Championships 1st Time trial 1st Team time trial National Road Championships 1st Road race 1st Time trial 2013 (2) African Road Championships 1st Time trial 1st Team time trial 1st Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia 2014 4th Overall Mzansi Tour 2015 (1) African Road Championships 1st Team time trial 2nd Time trial 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Mountains classification, Critérium du Dauphiné Tour de France Held after Stages 6–9 2016 (2) National Road Championships 1st Road race 1st Time trial 1st Mountains classification, Critérium du Dauphiné 3rd Time trial, African Road Championships 2017 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships 7th Overall Tour of Austria Giro d'Italia Held after Stages 2–3 2018 (1) 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 2019 9th Overall La Tropicale Amissa Bongo "Teklehaimanot moves to MTN-Qhubeka".
