San Jose de Buenavista, officially the Municipality of San Jose de Buenavista (Kinaray-a: Banwa kang San Jose de Buenavista; Hiligaynon: Banwa sang San Jose de Buenavista; Tagalog: Bayan ng San Jose de Buenavista), is a 1st class municipality and capital of the province of Antique, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 65,140 people, making it the most populous municipality in the province of Antique. It is often called simply San Jose. The municipality hosted the 2017 Palarong Pambansa. The Spaniards arrived in Antique in 1581. With them came Augustinian friars who Christianized the inhabitants. Its original name was Tubigon, being still a part of the municipality of Hamtic. In 1733, it was renamed San José and in 1790 it acquired its municipality through land grants issued by Philippine Governor General Félix Berenguer de Marquina. Later, it became a parish with its first parish priest, Father Manuel Ibáñez. Some two hundred years ago, the site now occupied by San José de Buenavista was a dense jungle and a favorite landing place for pirates to raid the area. In 1802, by popular demand, San José de Buenavista became the capital of the province of Antique and Agustín Sumandi was appointed as its first Gobernadorcillo, a sort of local governor during the Spanish Colonial Era. On November 24, 1898, San Jose de Buenavista was captured by Philippine Revolutionary Expeditionary Forces led by Gen. Leandro Fullon from Cavite during the Battle of Antique after a 2-day struggle. The rest of the Antique province under Spanish authority surrendered to the revolutionary forces. In 1954, by the virtue of Executive Order No. 3 of the President of the Philippines, the southern portion of San Jose de Buenavista was formed into an independent municipality under the name of Hamtic. The boundary was described to be "From a point on the south bank of the mouth of Malandog River running northeasterly in a straight imaginary line to a point on the northeast side of the San Jose-Hamtic provincial road ten meters west of the intersection of this northeast side of said road with the northwest side of the Sibalom-Piapi-Malandog provincial road; thence following approximately the same direction in an imaginary line that is parallel to, and ten meters distant from the said Sibalom-Piapi-Malandog provincial road until it touches the present boundary between San Jose and Sibalom."

In the 19th Congress of the Philippines, house bills were filed by various representatives which seeks San Jose de Buenavista including other capital towns of provinces with no current component cities, independent component cities or highly urbanized cities to automatically convert into cities.
