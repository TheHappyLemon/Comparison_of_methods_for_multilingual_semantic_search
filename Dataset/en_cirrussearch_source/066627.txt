The Ukrainian Air Assault Forces (Ukrainian: Десантно-штурмові війська України, romanized: Desantno-shturmovi viiska Ukrainy, abbreviated as DShV or AAFU), known until 2017 as the Ukrainian Airmobile Forces are the airborne forces of Ukraine. After the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, several Ukraine-based units from the Soviet Airborne Forces were absorbed into the newly-created Ukrainian Ground Forces, where they remained until 2016, when they separated to become one of five branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Air Assault Forces are in constant combat readiness. They are the high-mobility branch of the military, responsible for air assaults and military parachuting operations. Before the Russo-Ukrainian War they were also the main forces sent by Ukraine to peacekeeping missions around the world. They are considered the elite of Ukraine's armed forces. The Ukrainian Airmobile Forces were created in 1992 as part of the Ukrainian Ground Forces, from units of the Soviet Airborne Forces (VDV) stationed on Ukrainian territory after the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 25 December 1991. Part of the Soviet 98th Guards Airborne Division became the basis for the Ukrainian 1st Airmobile Division, which became known as the most capable division in the Ukrainian ground forces during the 1990s. In the 15 years after their creation, Ukrainian paratroopers have served in peacekeeping missions to the Balkans, in Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ethiopia, Georgia and DR Congo. In 2007, the 13th Separate Airmobile Battalion served as part of Polish–Ukrainian Peace Force Battalion, a peacekeeping unit with Kosovo Force. In August 2014 the 95th Air Assault Brigade conducted a raid behind the separatist lines. The 95th Brigade, which had been reinforced with armor assets and attachments, launched a surprise attack on separatist lines, broke through into their rear areas, fought for 450 kilometers, and destroyed or captured numerous Russian tanks and artillery pieces before returning to Ukrainian lines and established a corridor in which the Ukrainian army units and civilians trapped at the border could retreat. It was one of the longest armored raids in military history. In 2016, the Ukrainian Airmobile Forces became an independent branch of the Armed Forces. Previously, they were part of Ground Forces. On 21 November 2017 (Ukraine's Paratroopers' Day) President Petro Poroshenko stated that 469 Ukrainian paratroopers had been killed in the (ongoing) Russo-Ukrainian War. On 21 November 2018 he adjusted this to 487 killed. Air Assault Forces Day was celebrated on 2 August in Ukraine, as it was in the Soviet Union, until 2017, when it changed to 21 November 2017. President Poroshenko said "It is logical to celebrate your professional holiday on November 21. The usual August 2 is the date of the first jump of paratroopers in the Moscow Military District. How is it about us? Moscow is not Kyiv. Ukraine is not Russia." He added that "The start of the new Paratroop Day is part of the Ukrainianization of the historical and political calendar – the replacement of the Soviet-Russian imposed upon us." On 21 November 2017 the Air Assault Forces received its new insignia – the dome of a parachute "as a symbol of airborne units around the world" and the wings of Archangel Michael and "the flaming sword with which he hits the enemies". The color of the Ukrainian paratroopers was changed to maroon, and from 2017 the UkrAAF wear the maroon berets common to many Western airborne units. On 23 May 2018, President Poroshenko signed legislation that renamed the Airmobile Forces as the Air Assault Forces. Beginning Thursday, 24 February 2022, the day Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the UkrAAF have been participants of some of the land combat actions of the current conflict, fighting alongside their brethen from the Ground Forces, Territorial Defense and the National Guard. As of February 20th, 2024, the air assault forces suffered a total of 3,104 soldiers killed in action, according to publicly available information. In 2014, the staffing of an airmobile brigade was brought up to 1,200 servicemen. Each brigade was given at least one artillery battalion from the 25th and 55th artillery brigades and a tank battalion. Currently, the total staffing of the brigades ranges from 1,000 to 2,200 personnel, depending on the deployment. Most of the brigades operate in 1-2 battalion tactical groups, in each of which, in addition to infantry battalions, there are up to two field artillery battalions and at least one tank company equipped with BTRs and BMP IFVs. In 2001 the Airmobile Force consisted of: 77 Airmobile 25 Airborne 46 Airmobile 71 Jaeger 79 Air Assault 80 Air Assault 81 Airmobile 82 Air Assault 95 Air Assault Air Assault Forces Command, in Zhytomyr 135th Headquarters and HQ Battalion, in Zhytomyr VII Airborne Corps Corps HQ and HQ Battalion 25th Airborne Brigade, in Hvardiiske 46th Airmobile Brigade, in Poltava 71st Jaeger Brigade (Airmobile), in Kremenchuk 77th Airmobile Brigade, in Zhytomyr 79th Air Assault Brigade, in Mykolaiv 80th Air Assault Brigade, in Lviv 81st Airmobile Brigade, in Druzhkivka 82nd Air Assault Brigade, in Chernivtsi 95th Air Assault Brigade, in Zhytomyr 148th Field Artillery Brigade, in Zhytomyr Other combat and service support elements (under formation stage) 78th Assault Regiment "Herts" 23rd Tank Battalion 132nd Intelligence Battalion, in Zhytomyr As of January 2024 the support forces of the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces are: 71st Psychological Support Center, in Zhytomyr 102nd Materiel Storage Unit, in Zhytomyr 124th Topographic Unit, in Zhytomyr 33rd Combat Engineer Battalion 170th Logistic Battalion 199th Training and Education Center, in Zhytomyr 232nd Combined Supply Unit 347th Signals Unit, in Zhytomyr PM, semi-automatic pistol (9×18mm) Fort-14 [ru; uk] AKS-74, para assault rifle (AK-74 with folding skeleton buttstock) (5.45×39mm) AKS-74U, short-barreled para assault rifle carbine with folding skeleton buttstock(5.45×39mm) AKMS, para assault rifle with a downward-folding metal stock similar to that of the German MP40 (7.62×39mm) AK-TK [ru] – AK-74 modernization Fort-221 – TAR-21 licensed copy RPKS-74, the light weight para machinegun (5.45×39mm) PKM, general purpose machine gun (7.62×54mmR) Dragunov SVDS sniper rifle (7.62×54mmR) GP-25 and GP-30, the under-barrel 40 mm grenade launchers for fragmentation and gas grenades which are attached to AKS-74 of some paratroopers to increase firepower for combating enemy foot troops AGS-17 "Plamya" (Flame), automatic grenade launcher – may be replaced in the future by a much lighter UAG-40.
