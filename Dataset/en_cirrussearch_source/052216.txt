At the 1896 Summer Olympics, six cycling events were contested at the Neo Phaliron Velodrome. They were organized and prepared by the Sub-Committee for Cycling. Events were held on 8 April, 11 April, 12 April and 13 April 1896. Nineteen cyclists, all men, from five nations competed. These medals were retroactively assigned by the International Olympic Committee; at the time, winners were given a silver medal and subsequent places received no award. Every nation won at least a silver medal, with three winning golds. A total of 19 cyclists from five nations competed at the Athens Games:  Austria (1)  France (2)  Germany (5)  Great Britain (2)  Greece (9)(*) (*) NOTE: Including one cyclist (Nikos Loverdos) from Smyrna who competed for Greece.
