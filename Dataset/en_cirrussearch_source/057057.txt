Che, Cha or Chu (Ч ч; italics: Ч ч) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the voiceless postalveolar affricate /tʃ/, like ⟨tch⟩ in "switch" or ⟨ch⟩ in "choice". In English, it is romanized most often as ⟨ch⟩ but sometimes as ⟨tch⟩, like in French. In German, it can be transcribed as ⟨tsch⟩. In linguistics,[clarification needed] it is transcribed as ⟨č⟩ so "Tchaikovsky" (Чайковский in Russian) may be transcribed as Chaykovskiy or Čajkovskij. The letter Che (Ч ч) resembles an upside-down lowercase Latin H, as well as resembling the digit 4, especially in digital or open-ended form. The name of Che in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was чрьвь (črĭvĭ), meaning "worm". In the Cyrillic numeral system, Che had a value of 90. In all Slavic languages that use the Cyrillic alphabet, except Russian, Che represents the voiceless postalveolar affricate /tʃ/. In Russian, Che usually represents the voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate /t͡ɕ/, like the Mandarin pronunciation of j in pinyin. However, in a few words, it is pronounced as /tʂ/, like in Russian: лучше. Ч/ч is also pronounced as /tʂ/ in Serbian, as the Serbian letter Ћ/ћ is used for the /t͡ɕ/ sound. In Russian, in a few words, it represents /ʂ/ (like English ⟨sh⟩ /ʃ/ in "shape"): Russian: что, чтобы, нарочно. The 1955 version of Hanyu pinyin contained the Che for the sound [tɕ] (for which later the letter j was used), apparently because of its similarity to the Bopomofo letterㄐ.[citation needed] The Latin Zhuang alphabet used a modified Hindu-Arabic numeral 4, strongly resembling Che, from 1957 to 1986 to represent the fourth (falling) tone. In 1986, it was replaced by the Latin letter X. 4 : 4 - Number that very closely resembles Che, especially in digital or open ended form C c : Latin letter C - the same sound in Malay, Indonesian, Italian Č č : Latin letter C with caron Ç ç : Latin letter C with cedilla - an Albanian, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, Turkish, and Turkmen letter Ĉ ĉ : Latin letter C with circumflex, used in Esperanto language Tx : Digraph Tx, used in Basque and Catalan.
