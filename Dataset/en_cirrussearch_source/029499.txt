84 (eighty-four) is the natural number following 83 and preceding 85. 84 is a semiperfect number, being thrice a perfect number, and the sum of the sixth pair of twin primes (41+43){\displaystyle (41+43)}. It is the number of four-digit perfect powers in decimal. It is the third (or second) dodecahedral number, and the sum of the first seven triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36), which makes it the sixth tetrahedral number. The twenty-second unique prime in decimal, with notably different digits than its preceding (and known following) terms in the same sequence, contains a total of 84 digits. A hepteract is a seven-dimensional hypercube with 84 penteract 5-faces. 84 is the limit superior of the largest finite subgroup of the mapping class group of a genus g{\displaystyle g} surface divided by g{\displaystyle g}.[citation needed] Under Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem, a smooth connected Riemann surface X{\displaystyle X} of genus g>1{\displaystyle g>1} will contain an automorphism group Aut(X)=G{\displaystyle \mathrm {Aut} (X)=G} whose order is classically bound to |G|≤84 (g−1){\displaystyle |G|\leq 84{\text{ }}(g-1)}. 84 is the thirtieth and largest n{\displaystyle n} for which the cyclotomic field Q(ζn){\displaystyle \mathrm {Q} (\zeta _{n})} has class number 1{\displaystyle 1} (or unique factorization), preceding 60 (that is the composite index of 84), and 48. There are 84 zero divisors in the 16-dimensional sedenions S{\displaystyle \mathbb {S} }.
