Shumsk (Ukrainian: Шумськ, Polish: Szumsk, Yiddish: שומסק, romanized: Shimsk) is a city in Kremenets Raion, Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Shumsk urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population is 5,300 (2022 estimate). Until 18 July 2020, Shumsk was the administrative center of Shumsk Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ternopil Oblast to three. The area of Shumsk Raion was merged into Kremenets Raion. The name "Shumske" was officially used starting in 1944 when Shumske lost its city status but became the center of a newly formed district due to the division of the former Kremenets County in Volyn Voivodeship of Poland. On September 17, 1939, as part of Western Ukraine, Shumske was annexed by the Soviet Union's forces following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The name "Shumske" never really took hold, and people continued to use the ancient name "Shumsk," which was restored by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in 1999 in honor of Shumske's 850th anniversary.
