Maestro (/ˈmaɪstroʊ/; from the Italian maestro [maˈestro; maˈɛstro], meaning "master" or "teacher," plural: maestros or maestri) is an honorific title of respect, sometimes abbreviated Mo. The term is most commonly used in the context of Western classical music and opera, in line with the ubiquitous use of Italian musical terms. The word maestro is most often used in addressing or referring to conductors. Less frequently, one might refer to respected composers, performers, impresarios, musicologists, and music teachers. In the world of Italian opera, the title is also used to designate a number of positions within the orchestra and company that have specific duties during rehearsal and performance. These include: Maestro sostituto or maestro collaboratore: musicians who act as répétiteurs and assistant conductors during performances. Maestro concertatore, the keyboard continuo player, who prepares singers and leads rehearsals. Maestro direttore: the leader of the first violins of the orchestra (see concertmaster), who may also have administrative duties such as hiring and paying musicians Maestro suggeritore: the prompter Pandit Ustad "Online Etymology Dictionary".
