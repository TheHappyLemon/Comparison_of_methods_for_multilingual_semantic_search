Keiino (/Ààke…™no ä/ KAY-noh, Norwegian: [k√¶…™ÀànoÀê]; often stylised as KEiiNO) is a Norwegian band consisting of S√°mi rapper Fred Buljo and singers Alexandra Rotan and Tom Hugo. The group was created in late 2018 in order to participate in Melodi Grand Prix 2019; they won the competition and were thus selected to represent Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, where they finished in sixth place. The group was established in the late summer of 2018 when Tom Hugo and his husband, Alex Olsson, began writing "Spirit in the Sky", a song inspired by historical struggles for equality. They later joined S√°mi rapper and joiker Fred-Ren√© Buljo and singer Alexandra Rotan. The group name Keiino was inspired by the name of Buljo's home town Kautokeino (Northern Sami: Guovdageaidnu). The last part -geaidnu translates to the 'way' or 'road', which Buljo said "represents the road that brought us together" in an interview with TV 2. In an interview with the Kven-minority-centered media Ruijan Kaiku, Fred Buljo discussed his Kven/Finnish ancestry, and that they had worked with a Finnish producer, and thus landed on the name keino, the Kven variant of North Sami geaidnu 'way'. Alexandra Rotan explained that they each had their own career before Keiino, but it was Keiino that showed them the way to success. As a result of winning Melodi Grand Prix 2019, the group represented Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 with the song "Spirit in the Sky". In the second semi-final held on 16 May 2019, they qualified to the final. At the finals, their entry received the highest points from the televoting with a total of 291 points, although combined with their lesser score from the jury groups they finished in sixth place, with 331 points. On 8 May 2020, the group released their debut studio album, Okta. The album peaked at number 30 on the Norwegian chart. Okta was re-issued twice, first as a Norway-only deluxe CD in October 2021, and later as Okta (Guokte) on 24 February 2022. On 11 January 2021, it was announced that Keiino would participate in the Melodi Grand Prix 2021 final with the pre-qualified song "Monument". The song was released at midnight on 15 January 2021 with the group's debut performance of the song during the first heat of Melodi Grand Prix 2021 on 16 January 2021. The song reached the top four in the final on 20 February 2021, eventually reaching the gold duel, but lost to Tix's "Fallen Angel". Keiino embarked on an Australian tour in early 2022, which included performances at the Australian national final and the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. During the tour, Rotan was admitted to hospital due to an infected koala scratch. They took part in Melodi Grand Prix 2024 with the song "Damdiggida". Advancing from their semi-final, they ultimately finished in second place to G√•te's "Ulveham". "Shallow" did not enter the Swedish Singellista Chart, but peaked at number 12 on the Swedish Heatseeker Chart. Ertesv√•g, Oda Rugges√¶ter (2 March 2019). "Dette er √•rets MGP-artister".
