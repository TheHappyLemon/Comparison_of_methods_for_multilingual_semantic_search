He was forced by the Nazi administration to divorce his wife in 1940 and she was allowed to stay in the Aryan side of Warsaw while he was sent off to a ghetto. He continued to teach physics and chemistry at Juliusz Zweibaum's courses (Zweibaum conducted an underground medical training school) and continued to work until July 1942. He escaped before the ghetto residents were to be killed and hid in his wife's home. He was revealed by a caretaker's son and shot by the Gestapo on March 27, 1944 in front of his wife. He was buried in the Powązki Cemetery. Centnerszwer, research was in the field of chemical kinetics, corrosion, and equilibrium in multiphase systems. He published over 100 research papers. In 1928 he was awarded the title of Officier d'Academie Francaise and in 1929, received the Latvian Order of Three Stars. Roland, Charles G (1989).
