Newman is a surname of Germanic Anglo-Saxon origins. Newman is the modern English form of the name used in Great Britain and among people of British ancestry around the world (as is 'Numan') , while Neumann (with variant spellings) is used in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, and to some degree in Netherlands and Belgium. Both have their its origins in the pre-7th-century (Old English) word neowe meaning "new", with mann, meaning man. Its first recorded uses were Godwin Nieweman in Oxfordshire, England, in 1169, and in Germany, Herman Nyeman of Barth in 1325. It was mostly likely originally used as a nickname for a recent arrival or settler. Related surnames include Neuman, Naumann(s), Numan, Nauman, and Neiman.
