Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo was held in three categories: artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics and trampolining. All gymnastics events were staged at the Olympic Gymnastic Centre, Tokyo in 2021. The programme for 2020 remained unchanged from 2016, despite an application from the FIG for the admission of a new parkour based event. The application had proved contentious with specialist parkour or freerunning organisations lobbying for the sport not to be included, and to be recognized as an entirely separate sport from gymnastics. Originally planned as a temporary venue, in 2016, the Tokyo 2020 authorities confirmed the Olympic Gymnastic Centre would become a permanent venue, functioning as a convention centre after the Games. Before its refurbishment, the venue was also expected to host the Boccia event at the 2020 Summer Paralympics. There was one unbroken tie in artistic gymnastics: bronze in the women's floor final. The qualification pathway for the 2020 Summer Olympics was significantly overhauled and modified from 2016. The men's and women's team events in artistic gymnastics were reduced from five members per team to four, while further allocations were available for up to two specialists. In a further move to link several FIG competitions to the Olympic Games, qualification places will now be available based on an aggregate of scores achieved over the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series, and the various continental artistic gymnastics championships. Japan, as the host country, receives a guaranteed spot, in case it were not to earn one by the regular qualifying methods.  Albania (1)  Argentina (1)  Armenia (1)  Australia (11)  Austria (1)  Azerbaijan (8)  Belarus (11)  Belgium (4)  Brazil (12)  Bulgaria (8)  Canada (7)  Cape Verde (1)  Cayman Islands (1)  Chile (2)  China (21)  Colombia (1)  Costa Rica (1)  Croatia (2)  Cuba (1)  Cyprus (1)  Czech Republic (1)  Egypt (11)  France (9)  Georgia (1)  Germany (8)  Great Britain (10)  Greece (1)  Hong Kong (1)  Hungary (2)  India (1)  Ireland (2)  Israel (10)  Italy (14)  Jamaica (1)  Japan (22) (host)  Kazakhstan (2)  Lithuania (1)  Malaysia (2)  Mexico (4)  Netherlands (6)  New Zealand (3)  Nigeria (1)  Norway (2)  Peru (1)  Philippines (1)  Poland (1)  Portugal (2)  Romania (3)  ROC (23)  Singapore (1)  Slovakia (1)  Slovenia (1)  South Africa (2)  South Korea (7)  Spain (9)  Sri Lanka (1)  Sweden (2)  Switzerland (5)  Chinese Taipei (5)  Turkey (5)  Ukraine (13)  United States (20)  Uzbekistan (8)  Vietnam (2)   *   Host nation (Japan) Men Women Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games Gymnastics at the 2018 Commonwealth Games Gymnastics at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics Gymnastics at the 2019 African Games Gymnastics at the 2019 European Games Gymnastics at the 2019 Pan American Games Gymnastics at the 2019 Summer Universiade International Gymnastics Federation present parkour for Olympic inclusion at Tokyo 2020, from insidethegames.biz Tokyo 2020 Gymnastic Centre will no longer be a temporary venue, from insidethegames.biz Gymnastics Qualification schedule for the Games of the XXXII Olympiad "Schedule - Gymnastics Tokyo 2020 Olympics".
