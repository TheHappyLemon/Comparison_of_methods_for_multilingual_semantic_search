The Supreme Commander–in–Chief (Supreme Commander) is the supreme commander of the armed forces of a state (or coalition of states), usually in wartime and sometimes in peacetime. The Supreme Commander–in–Chief is also vested with extraordinary power in relation to all civilian institutions and persons on the territory of a given state and the theater of military operations (theater of war). As a rule, the head of state is the Supreme Commander–in–Chief. For the first time, the corresponding English term was used by the king of England, Scotland and Ireland, Charles I (1625–1649). In some states of the British Commonwealth, this position is replaced by the Governor–General. The All–Russian Emperor, according to Article 14 of the Basic Laws of the Russian Empire, was the "sovereign leader" of the Russian Armed Forces, he possessed the supreme command over all land and naval armed forces of the Russian state and the exclusive right to issue decrees and orders "to everything generally related to the organization of the armed forces and defense of the Russian State", as well as the establishment of restrictions on the right of residence and the acquisition of real estate in the localities that make up the fortress areas and strongholds for the army and navy. The emperor declared areas of martial law or exceptional status (Article 15). At the same time, the legislation of the Russian Empire allowed the existence of this position as separate from the position of the head of state. Thus, the provision on field command and control of troops in wartime provided that "The supreme command over all land and naval forces intended for military operations shall be entrusted to the Supreme Commander–in–Chief, if the sovereign does not deign to lead the troops personally" (Article 6), such was appointed "by direct the election of the sovereign "(that is, independently by the Emperor, and not by anyone's recommendation) by the highest order and decree of the Senate. The Supreme Commander–in–Chief was defined as "the supreme commander of all land and naval armed forces intended for military action" (Article 17), was responsible only to the Emperor and was subordinate only to him (Article 20). In the theater of operations, his orders had the same force as the Imperial commands (Article 17). The Commander–in–Chief of the Russian Armed Forces could, "if military circumstances have it", conclude and terminate an armistice with the enemy, immediately informing the Emperor about it, but if the armistice or its termination does not seem "urgently necessary", then he should have obtained the Emperor's consent before his conclusion and termination (Article 25), but he could not enter into peace negotiations without a special order from the Emperor (Article 26). For the first time in Russian history, this position was replaced on July 20, 1914. Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich Junior was appointed to it.
