Orio al Serio International Airport, also styled as Milan Bergamo Airport for commercial purposes, (IATA: BGY, ICAO: LIME) is the third-busiest international airport in Italy. The airport is also officially called Il Caravaggio International Airport after the Baroque painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, who originally hailed from the nearby town of Caravaggio. The airport is located in Orio al Serio, 3.7 km (2.3 mi) southeast of Bergamo and 45 km (28 mi) northeast of Milan. The airport is part of the airport network of the Milan metropolitan area, alongside Malpensa Airport and Linate Airport. The airport served almost 13 million passengers in 2018 and is one of Ryanair's three main operating bases, along with Dublin Airport and London Stansted Airport. The airport is managed by SACBO, a company partially owned by SEA – Aeroporti di Milano, the operator of Linate and Malpensa airports. SEA, the company that runs the latter two airports, also holds a 31% stake in SACBO. The airport has one passenger terminal and two jet-bridge gates.[citation needed] The terminal is split into two zones, A (Gates A1-A15) and B (Gates B1-B5). Gates A13 and B5 are equipped with boarding bridges, the remaining gates are remote gates In March 2021, DHL Aviation announced plans to relocate their hub from Bergamo to Milan Malpensa Airport where DHL opened new logistics facilities. In early 2022, DHL confirmed the end of all operations at Bergamo.

On 5 August 2016, during the night, Boeing 737-476 (SF) registered HA-FAX, operated by ASL Airlines Hungary, overshot while landing on runway 28 in Bergamo and came to a stop on a parking lot and on a secondary highway lane that is around the airport, 300 m from the runway end. No one was injured, but some cars were destroyed and the plane sustained substantial damages. The plane was removed from the street the same day. The air traffic remained unvaried without delays. The A4 is one of the main road networks that links the airport. There are several public transportation links to and from downtown Milan, including express coaches. There are further connections to/from Bergamo city center, Arezzo, Bologna, Brescia, Monza, Turin, Malpensa Airport, and Milan Trade Exhibition Center, Parma, Torino, and Verona.
