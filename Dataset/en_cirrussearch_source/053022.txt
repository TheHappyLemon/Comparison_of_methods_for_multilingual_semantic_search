The International Day of Families is observed on 15 May every year. The Day was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in 1993 with resolution A/RES/47/237 and reflects the importance the international community attaches to families. The International Day provides an opportunity to promote awareness of issues relating to families and to increase knowledge of the social, economic and demographic processes affecting families. Every year, the UN secretary-general announces a theme for the International Day of Families. 2023 - "Family Demographic Trends" 2022 - "Families and Urbanization" 2021 - "Families and New Technologies" 2020 - "Families in Development: Copenhagen & Beijing + 25” 2019 - "Families and Climate Action: Focus on SDG 13" 2018 - "Families and inclusive societies" 2017 - "Families, education and well-being" 2016 - "Families, healthy lives and sustainable future" 2015 - "Men in charge?
