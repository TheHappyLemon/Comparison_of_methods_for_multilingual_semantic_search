In the 19th century, Dzintari became popular with Russian aristocrats. Dzintari is one of the most historical neighborhoods in Jūrmala. In 1879, a well-house was built, but it burnt down few years later. In 1878, an outdoor stage for concerts was built, later known as Edinburgh Well-house Concert Hall.
