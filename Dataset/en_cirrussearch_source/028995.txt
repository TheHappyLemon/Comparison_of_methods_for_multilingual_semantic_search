Princess Charlotte of Wales (Charlotte Elizabeth Diana; born 2 May 2015) is a member of the British royal family. She is the second child and only daughter of William, Prince of Wales, and Catherine, Princess of Wales. A granddaughter of Charles III, she is third in the line of succession to the British throne. Princess Charlotte was born on 2 May 2015 in St Mary's Hospital, London, at 08:34 BST, during the reign of her paternal great-grandmother Elizabeth II, as the second child of Prince William and Catherine, then known as Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Her birth was marked by gun salutes and illuminating London landmarks pink. On 4 May her name was announced as Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, honouring her grandfather Charles, her great-grandmother, and her grandmother Diana. Charlotte was christened on 5 July by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham. The family lived at Anmer Hall in Norfolk during Charlotte's infancy, before relocating to Kensington Palace in 2017. Charlotte started at Willcocks Nursery School in January 2018. She joined her elder brother Prince George at Thomas's School in Battersea in September 2019, where she was known as Charlotte Cambridge. In 2022, the family relocated to Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Home Park, after which she and her siblings began attending Lambrook, an independent preparatory school in Berkshire. On 8 September 2022, Elizabeth II died and was succeeded by Charlotte's grandfather as Charles III. Accordingly, Charlotte became third in line to the throne. Charlotte and her siblings occasionally accompany their parents on royal engagements, tours, and diplomatic visits. Despite the efforts of her parents to shelter their children from public view, photographs and public appearances of Charlotte continue to cause media frenzies. Shopping statistics and polls among parents show that Charlotte is a major children's style icon. Brand Finance previously estimated that she will be worth more than £3 billion to the British economy throughout her lifetime. In August 2023, Reader's Digest valued her at $4.6 billion or £3.6 billion. Charlotte is a British princess with the official style and title "Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Wales". Before her father was created Prince of Wales on 9 September 2022, Charlotte was styled "Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge". Charlotte is third in the line of succession to the British throne, behind her father and elder brother. Because of the implementation of the Perth Agreement, which replaced male-preference primogeniture with absolute primogeniture, she did not move down the line of succession upon the birth of her younger brother, Prince Louis, in April 2018, making her the first British princess in history to rank above a brother in the line of succession.
