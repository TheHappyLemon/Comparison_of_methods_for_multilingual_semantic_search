The FIS Ski Jumping World Cup is the world's highest level of ski jumping and the FIS Ski Flying World Cup as the subdivisional part of the competition. It was founded by Torbjørn Yggeseth for the 1979/80 season and organized by the International Ski Federation. Women began competing during the 2011/12 season. The rounds are hosted primarily in Europe, with regular stops in Japan and rarely in North America. These have been hosted in 20 countries around the world for both men and women: Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. Summer Grand Prix is the top level summer competition on plastic. The lower competitive circuits include the Continental Cup, the Inter-Continental Cup, the FIS Cup, the FIS Race and the Alpen Cup. The Olympic Winter Games, the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships and the FIS Ski Flying World Championships do not count towards the World Cup. However, the 1984 Olympic Games, the 1982 Nordic World Ski Championships and the 1992, 1994, 1996 and 1998 Ski Flying World Championships were counted towards the World Cup. The maps display all 64 locations around the globe that have hosted World Cup events for men (57) and women (20) at least one time in the history of the competition. Râșnov in 2020 was the latest new host. Four Hills Tournament (1979– ) Nordic Tour (1997–2010); Raw Air (2017– ) Swiss Tour (1980–1992) Bohemia Tour (1981–1994) Nordic Tour (1997–2010) FIS Team Tour (Oberstdorf included, 2009–2013) Each season consists of 25–30 competitions, usually two competitions on the same hill during a weekend. One competition consists of a qualifying round; first round, with 50 competitors; and second round, with 30. Qualifying round for the main event was introduced in 1990 to limit the number of competitors. The top 30 in the first round advance to the second round, which is held in reverse order, so the best jumper in the first round jumps last. The aggregate score in the first and second rounds determine the competition results. The top 30 are awarded World Cup points. The winner gets 100 points while number 30 receives 1 point. At team events only top 8 receive points. The table below shows the three highest ranked jumpers each year. *This additional title was awarded from 1996 to 2000 for the best individual normal and large hill results only. The winner received a small Crystal Globe. This title was distinct from the overall WC, which included ski flying.
