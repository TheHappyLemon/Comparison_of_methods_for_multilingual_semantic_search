She played Seth Rogen's love interest in 2009's Funny People, directed by Judd Apatow. She appeared in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and Derrick Comedy's Mystery Team, which debuted at 2009 Sundance. She appeared in a CollegeHumor short alongside Jason Bateman and Will Arnett. She played April Ludgate in Parks and Recreation from 2009 to 2015. She received wide praise for her deadpan performance and was considered one of the show's breakout characters. On March 12, 2010, Plaza performed at A Night of 140 Tweets: A Celebrity Tweetathon for Haiti, produced by Rob Huebel, Paul Scheer, Ben Stiller, and Mike Rosenstein, at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Los Angeles.

Her performance was critically acclaimed. She won the award for Breakthrough Performance (Female) at the 2012 Young Hollywood Awards. During a 2012 filming of an episode of Parks and Recreation at the White House, she met Vice President Joe Biden and stole his notes about her from his desk. In 2013, she had the leading female role as Sacagawea in the Drunk History episode "Nashville" during a segment on Lewis and Clark's expedition. In 2013, she also had the starring role in the CBS Film The To Do List. In an impromptu attempt to promote the film, Plaza ran onto the stage at the 2013 MTV Movie Awards and grabbed Will Ferrell's award for Comedic Genius, inspired by Kanye West's interruption of Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, with a drink in hand while the film's name was written across her chest. She was ejected from the studio lot where the ceremony was held. At the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, Plaza's film Life After Beth, which was written and directed by her husband Jeff Baena, premiered. Plaza also voiced Grumpy Cat in the Lifetime Network's original movie Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever (2014). In 2016, Plaza starred in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates alongside Zac Efron, Anna Kendrick and Adam DeVine. Her role as the rebellious Tatiana earned her critical praise. Then, she was a guest star on Harmonquest, as a gnome named "Hawaiian Coffee" and portrayed Aaron Burr in the "Hamilton" episode of Drunk History. She also provided a guest voice for the SpongeBob SquarePants episode "Mall Girl Pearl" with Betty White. In 2016, she portrayed Cat Adams, a contract killer, first in Season 11 of the CBS television series Criminal Minds, and then again in Season 12 and 15. In 2017, Plaza both starred in and produced two films, The Little Hours and Ingrid Goes West. The latter premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and later earned the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. Plaza starred as the social media obsessed fan of a celebrity played by Elizabeth Olsen. Variety film critic Peter Debruge praised Plaza's performance writing, "Plaza's tortured performance captures all of this, which is saying something for an actress whose blasé persona hinges on the fact that she can't be bothered: Nobody plays ambivalence better, and yet, Plaza allows herself to seem vulnerable here." In 2018, she starred in the indie comedy An Evening with Beverly Luff Linn. Plaza starred as both Amahl Farouk / Shadow King and Lenny Busker in the FX series Legion from 2017 to 2019. In both 2019 and 2020, Plaza hosted the Independent Spirit Awards.

In 2021, Plaza wrote a children's book, The Legend of the Christmas Witch, along with co-author Dan Murphy and illustrator Julia Iredale. Plaza produced and starred in the film Emily the Criminal, which premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival. She also appears in the film Spin Me Round, which premiered at the South by Southwest film festival in 2022. In January 2022, it was announced that Plaza would star in the second season of the HBO series The White Lotus.

For her role, she received a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards. On August 25, 2022, Little Demon premiered on FXX. The series stars Plaza (who is also an executive producer), alongside Danny DeVito and Lucy DeVito. On October 16, 2022, Plaza was given the Artist of Distinction Award at the Newport Beach Film Festival. In November 2022, Plaza was cast as witch Rio Vidal in the Disney+ series Agatha: Darkhold Diaries, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In 2023, Plaza received backlash for her participation in an ad for the dairy industry that mocked plant-based milk. On July 26 it was announced that she would be making her stage debut off-Broadway in the revival of John Patrick Shanley's Danny and the Deep Blue Sea opposite Christopher Abbott. Although the show received mixed reviews, Plaza was credited for making a strong first attempt on stage. She claimed to be nervous to take the stage, although she had done so more than 15 years earlier. In 2024, Plaza and her Parks and Recreation costar Nick Offerman reunited in a Mountain Dew ad that aired during the Super Bowl LVIII broadcast. In 2016, Plaza stated that she and Michael Cera were in a relationship for "around 18 months" after they starred together in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and considered getting married before the relationship ended. She has been in a relationship with writer and director Jeff Baena since 2011. By May 2021, Plaza and Baena were married. In 2016, she came out as bisexual and stated "Girls are into me—that's no secret. Hey, I'm into them, too. I fall in love with girls and guys. I can't help it." Plaza had a stroke when she was 20 years old that caused temporary paralysis and temporary expressive aphasia. Several years later, she had a transient ischemic attack while on the set of Parks and Recreation.

But she has an unusual kind of beauty (Anglo-Irish, Latina) that the camera loves to explore, and when she does make the hyperspace jump to sincerity and initiative, the results are compelling.
