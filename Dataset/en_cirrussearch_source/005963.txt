The team formed in 1967 as the basketball section of Beşiktaş J.K., which was founded in 1903. The team competes in the Turkish Basketball Super League and in the EuroCup. The club's men's basketball section started out in the year 1967 and since then, Beşiktaş has played in the first Turkish Basketball Super League, in every season, except in the 1988–89 season, due to their relegation to the Turkish Basketball First League after the 1987–88 season. The club won the Turkish Basketball Super League, under the management of Ateş Çubukçu [tr] and Tom Davis, in the 1974–75 season. In October 2010, Beşiktaş announced the biggest transfer in the history of the club's basketball department, with the signing of the former NBA Most Valuable Player, Allen Iverson. Iverson signed a 2-year $4 million net income contract. In July 2011, NBA All-Star Deron Williams of the Brooklyn Nets, announced he would play for Beşiktaş, due to the 2011 NBA lockout. His $5 million net income contract included a clause that would enable him to return to the NBA during the regular season, if an agreement was made between the owners and players association. When the lockout finished, Williams was replaced by Carlos Arroyo. Arroyo led the team to the Turkish Cup title in February 2012. In April 2012, the team won the 3rd-tier level EuroChallenge Final against Elan Chalon.
