It is 189 km from the capital city, Tallinn, and 125 km from the second largest city, Tartu. Mõisaküla arose on the fens of Abja manor (mõis), after which it is named. It was a large railway hub in the 1920s and 1930s, when two narrow-gauge lines came through Mõisaküla, serving all of Estonia until the 1970s when the Soviets closed both lines. It became a town on 1 May 1938. A Lutheran church was established in 1934, but was burned and destroyed in 1983; restoration of the church started in 2005 and the church reopened in 2014.
