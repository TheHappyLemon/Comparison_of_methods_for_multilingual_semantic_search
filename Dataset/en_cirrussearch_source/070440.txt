Boyarsky supports the policies pursued by Presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev. In particular, he attributes to Putin the opening of the country's borders in the early 1990s: K. Larina: It was not Putin who opened the borders, sorry. M. Boyarsky: Then who did it? K. Larina: Borders? I believe our borders were open after 1990. M. Boyarsky: So consider that from that time on he already began to influence this... K. Larina: Vladimir Putin? M. Boyarsky: Vladimir Vladimirovich, yes. And now it has become possible to study in any country... — Interview on the radio station Echo of Moscow, program Dithyramb with Ksenia Larina, 2008 By his own admission, Boyarsky is a conservative, a supporter of the monarchy, and an opponent of communist views. ...I am completely for Putin, for his successor, for the country to develop as they intended. This is very important for me, I am simply shocked by the percentages that the communist Zyuganov has. It’s just a mystery to me how much you can step on a rake. That is why I could not afford not to go and vote for Medvedev. I am categorically against any communist proposals. Then there will be no Gazprom, no anything else, no skating rinks, no sports. There will be khrushchevkas, there will be bombed churches, it will be equal for everyone. Zyuganov will take most of it for himself, out of nomenklatura habit. Therefore, I am categorically against this. <…> This party should have been banned a long time ago. — Interview on the radio station Echo of Moscow, program Dithyramb with Ksenia Larina, 2008 In 2001, Boyarsky signed a letter in defense of the NTV channel. In 2003, Boyarsky supported Valentina Matviyenko during the election campaign for governor of St. Petersburg.

On 6 February 2012, Boyarsky was officially registered as a trusted representative of the presidential candidate and then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
