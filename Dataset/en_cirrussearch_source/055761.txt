Guillaume Séron (born 19 April 1877) was a Belgian athlete who competed in water polo. Séron competed for the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club, and the team was selected to represent Belgium at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. The team won a silver medal after losing in the final against the Osborne Swimming club, which represented Great Britain, but this came after the Belgium team had beaten two French sides in the previous rounds.
