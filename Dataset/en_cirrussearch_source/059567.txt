Hermann Joseph Barrelet de Ricou (25 September 1879 – 24 April 1964) was a Swiss-born French rower. He won gold medals in single sculls at the 1900 Summer Olympics and 1901 European Championships. Barrelet continued to compete in single sculls into his thirties, but had better achievements in team events, winning European titles in the men's eight (1909) and double sculls (1913, with Anatol Peresselenzeff).
