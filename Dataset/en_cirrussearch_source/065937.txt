Poltava Governorate was an administrative-territorial unit (guberniya) of the Russian Empire. It included the territory of left-bank Ukraine and was officially created in 1802 from the disbanded Little Russia Governorate, which was split between Chernigov and Poltava Governorates with its capital in Poltava. It was administered by 15 uezds (povits): Gadyachsky Uyezd (Gadyach – Гадячъ) (Hadiach) Zenkovsky Uyezd (Zenkov – Зеньковъ) (Zinkiv) Zolotonoshsky Uyezd (Zolotonosha – Золотоноша) Kobelyaksky Uyezd (Kobeliaky – Кобеляки) Konstantinogradsky Uyezd (Konstantinograd – Константиноградъ) (modern Krasnohrad) Kremenchugsky Uyezd (Kremenchug – Кременчугъ) (Kremenchuk) Lokhvitsky Uyezd (Lokhvytsia – Лохвица) (Lokhvytsia) Lubensky Uyezd (Lubny – Лубны) Mirgorodsky Uyezd (Mirgorod – Миргородъ) (Myrhorod) Pereyaslavsky Uyezd (Pereiaslav – Переяславъ) Piryatinsky Uyezd (Pyriatyn – Пирятинъ) (Pyriatyn) Poltavsky Uyezd (Poltava – Полтава) Priluksky Uyezd (Pryluky – Прилуки) (Pryluky) Romensky Uyezd (Romny – Ромны) Khorolsky Uyezd (Khorol – Хороль) Most of these ended up in the modern Poltava Oblast of Ukraine, although some: Zolotonosha, Krasnohrad, Pereiaslav and Romny are now part of Cherkasy, Kharkiv, Kyiv and Sumy Oblasts respectively. The Poltava Governorate covered a total area of 49,365 km2, and had a population of 2,778,151 according to the 1897 Russian Empire census.
