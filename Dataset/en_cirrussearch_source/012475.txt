These results caused her to drop out of the top 20. Kicking off her clay-court season in Stuttgart, Pavlyuchenkova finally gained some momentum by making her first ever quarterfinal at the tournament, beating Madison Keys and second seed Garbiñe Muguruza, the latter by via retirement. There, she succumbed to Anett Kontaveit in three sets. She then lost her openers in Madrid and Rome, in the hands of Samantha Stosur and Keys, respectively. As a result, she fell out of the top 30 for the first time since 2015. Pavlyuchenkova then soared into her first final of the year at the Internationaux de Strasbourg. Seeded third, she saw off the likes of Tatjana Maria, Natalia Vikhlyantseva, Zarina Diyas and top seed Ashleigh Barty en route. In the final, she came out on top in a three-set marathon final, with all sets going to a tiebreak, against fifth-seeded veteran Dominika Cibulková. Pavlyuchenkova called that match, which ended 6–7, 7–6, 7–6, after 215 minutes, "the most dramatic I ever played". At the French Open, she was eliminated in the second round by Stosur in straight sets. Pavlyuchenkova did not enjoy much success on grass, netting just one win across three tournaments on the surface, which includes an opening-round loss in Wimbledon to Hsieh Su-wei as well. The following month, at the Rogers Cup, she fell in the second round to Simona Halep and in Cincinnati the following week, in the same round to Angelique Kerber. She was then upset by Rebecca Peterson in the first round of the US Open in three sets. She then lost in the second round of the Pan Pacific Open to Caroline Garcia despite having two match points. She then recorded her best result in four months by making the last eight in Wuhan, scoring wins over Anastasija Sevastova, Kiki Bertens and Petra Kvitová. There, she lost to Barty in three sets. The following week at the China Open, she succumbed in the first round to Sloane Stephens in an intense battle in three sets. She ended the season with back-to-back quarterfinal appearances, in Linz and Moscow, falling on both occasions to Russians Ekaterina Alexandrova and Daria Kasatkina, respectively. Pavlyuchenkova's results in 2018 saw her finish the year at world No. 42, her worst season finish in ten years and her first outside the top 30 since 2012. Pavlyuchenkova began the 2019 season with early exits at the Shenzhen Open and the Hobart International, losing to a pair of youngsters in Veronika Kudermetova and Vera Lapko, respectively. Unseeded at the Australian Open, she began her campaign with a victory over Monica Puig. She then came from a set down to upset ninth seed Kiki Bertens, before defeating Aliaksandra Sasnovich to reach the round of 16. There, she came from a set and a break down to upset fifth seed Sloane Stephens and thus, earned herself a berth in her fifth Grand Slam quarterfinal, where she faced first-time Grand Slam quarterfinalist Danielle Collins. Despite having won the opening set comfortably, Pavlyuchenkova was upset by the American player in the end. Pavlyuchenkova followed up that result with a quarterfinal showing in St. Petersburg where she lost to eventual champion Bertens, in three sets. Pavlyuchenkova then went on a three-match losing streak as she lost her openers in Dubai, Indian Wells and Miami. Seeded third in Monterrey, Pavlyuchenkova sauntered into the last eight with wins over Anna Blinkova and Ivana Jorović with a combined loss of just three games but there, she was eliminated by eventual runner-up Victoria Azarenka in straight sets. On Fed Cup duty against Italy for a place in World Group II, Pavlyuchenkova won her singles matches over Jasmine Paolini and Martina Trevisan with the Russian team eventually winning the tie 4–0. She then lost in the second round at Stuttgart to Anett Kontaveit in straight sets, in a rematch of their quarterfinal clash here a year ago. Pavlyuchenkova's form mid-season did not improve as she suffered a five-match losing streak after Stuttgart, which includes losses at the French Open and Wimbledon, resulting in her ranking falling out of the top 40 to as low as No. 46, her lowest ranking in more than 10 years. At the Rogers Cup, she scored her first win in more than three months, and her third over a top-ten player in 2019, when she defeated ninth seed Aryna Sabalenka in the first round but then lost to Jeļena Ostapenko. After falling to Zarina Diyas in qualifying at Cincinnati, Pavlyuchenkova scored her first win at the US Open since 2016 by beating Pauline Parmentier in the opening round but then lost to Bertens in straight sets. Pavlyuchenkova started off the Asian swing by recording by her best result of the year by making the final of the Pan Pacific Open, her second at the tournament, defeating the likes of Dayana Yastremska, Bertens, Misaki Doi and Angelique Kerber en route, where she finished runner-up to Naomi Osaka. She was, however, unable to back up this result, falling early in her next three tournaments, with back-to-back defeats in the hands of Sofia Kenin in Wuhan and Beijing, and to Viktória Kužmová in Linz. She then bounced back by reaching her second final of the season at the Kremlin Cup, also her third at the tournament, by seeing off seventh seed Maria Sakkari, qualifier Varvara Gracheva, Kudermetova and Karolína Muchová en route. Against third seed Belinda Bencic in the final, despite having won the first set, Pavlyuchenkova succumbed to the Swiss in the end. Nevertheless, her turnaround in the back end of the year which saw her win ten of her 15 matches after the US Open ensured her a top-30 season finish, at world No. 30. Pavlyuchenkova began the 2020 season with early losses, once again. After losing against Kvitová from a set up in the opening round in Brisbane, she scored her first win of the year, in Adelaide over Anett Kontaveit in straight sets. She faced world No. 1, Ashleigh Barty, in the next round and lost despite having led by a set, again. Seeded 30th at the Australian Open, she recorded straight-set wins over Nina Stojanović and Taylor Townsend in her first two matches. She then caused a huge upset by defeating second seed Karolína Plíšková in the third round, her first win in seven career meetings over the former world No. 1. She then came from a set down to defeat 2016 champion and 17th seeded Angelique Kerber to advance to the quarterfinals for the second year in a row, also her sixth Grand Slam quarterfinal in total. There, she was defeated by eventual runner-up, Garbiñe Muguruza, in straight sets. Pavlyuchenkova played one more tournament before the tour was suspended in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making the second round at the Dubai Championships after upsetting fourth seed and defending champion Belinda Bencic but there, she lost to Kontaveit. Returning to competition after the lifting of the suspension in August, at the Prague Open, a sixth-seeded Pavlyuchenkova dropped her opening match to Arantxa Rus. She then chose to skip the US Open due to safety concerns over the ongoing pandemic, which saw her streak of 48 consecutive Grand Slam tournament appearances, dating back to the 2008 French Open, come to an end. The next month, Pavlyuchenkova competed at the Italian Open where she beat Zhang Shuai in her opening match but then lost to fourth seed Elina Svitolina, in straight sets. She then reached the second round in Strasbourg where she lost to Jil Teichmann. At her final tournament of the season, the French Open, Pavlyuchenkova made the second round after upsetting former champion and 28th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova, in three sets. There, however, she fell to Kateřina Siniaková in straight sets. She then finished the year ranked world No. 38, her third non-top 30 finish since 2009. Pavlyuchenkova started her 2021 season in Abu Dhabi where she was beaten at the first hurdle by Ons Jabeur. She then scored straight-set wins over Misaki Doi and Anastasija Sevastova to reach the third round at the Yarra Valley Classic, losing to eventual finalist Garbiñe Muguruza. At the Australian Open, she lost in the first round to third seed and eventual champion Naomi Osaka. After that, Pavlyuchenkova competed at the Phillip Island Trophy and defeated Ajla Tomljanović in her opening match but then lost to eventual champion Daria Kasatkina in three sets. After a dry spell of two wins across four tournaments, Pavlyuchenkova rebounded at the Madrid Open by sealing her best result since the tour restart last August with a run to the semifinals, defeating Madison Keys, Karolína Plíšková, Jennifer Brady and Karolína Muchová. There, she was defeated by eventual champion Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets. It was Pavlyuchenkova's best showing at a WTA 1000 event since reaching the same stage at the Cincinnati Open in 2010, and her best at a Mandatory tournament since being a semifinalist at the 2009 Indian Wells Open, over 12 years ago. At the French Open, Pavlyuchenkova was seeded 31st and moved into the second week for the first time since 2011 after seeing off Christina McHale and Tomljanović in the first two rounds, before following up with an upset win over third seed Sabalenka in three sets. She would progress further by coming back from a set down to beat 15th seed Victoria Azarenka to return to the last eight there for the first time since 2011, thus making it her seventh Grand Slam quarterfinal showing overall. There, 10 years removed from her first quarterfinal at a Grand Slam tournament (where she then lost to defending champion and eventual runner-up Francesca Schiavone from a set and a break up), Pavlyuchenkova came back from a set down to prevail over 21st seed and doubles partner Elena Rybakina, winning 9–7 in the third set, thus advancing to the last four of a Grand Slam for the first time in her career. In the semifinals, Pavlyuchenkova recorded her first straight-set win in four matches by beating fellow Grand Slam semifinal debutante Tamara Zidanšek to reach her first Grand Slam final, doing so on her 52nd overall appearance in the main draw of Grand Slams, a new record. In the championship match, Pavlyuchenkova lost to fellow Grand Slam debutante Barbora Krejčíková in three sets, making it her first runner-up finish on clay. Her run in Paris this fortnight, however, put her back in the top 20 rankings, for the first time since 2018. In June, at the grass-court warm-up event in Eastbourne, eighth seed Pavlyuchenkova lost in the first round to eventual champion Jeļena Ostapenko in straight sets. Seeded 16th at Wimbledon, Pavlyuchenkova recorded back-to-back wins there for the first time since 2016, defeating Ana Bogdan and Kristýna Plíšková, before falling in the third round to 19th seed Karolína Muchová. In her second appearance at the Summer Olympics, Pavlyuchenkova was the 13th seed in the singles tournament and advanced to her maiden Olympic quarterfinal, doing so with an Olympic record of seven games surrendered, as she saw off Sara Errani, Anna-Lena Friedsam, and Sara Sorribes Tormo. She was later defeated by the eventual gold medalist, for the second Olympics in a row, when she succumbed to ninth seed Belinda Bencic in three sets. In mixed doubles, Pavlyuchenkova tasted greater success. Partnering Andrey Rublev, the first-time pairing sailed to the final, and took home the gold medal over compatriots Aslan Karatsev and Elena Vesnina after saving a match point. Pavlyuchenkova entered the Canadian Open as the 10th seed and recorded a straight-set win over Caroline Garcia in the first round, but failed to move on past the second round after losing to Jessica Pegula in three sets. At the US Open, Pavlyuchenkova recorded her best result there in 10 years by making it to the second week here for the first time since 2011, with wins over Alison Riske, Anna Karolina Schmiedlova and Varvara Gracheva. In the fourth round, she lost to fourth seed Karolína Plíšková in straight sets. The subsequent four tournament appearances of Pavlyuchenkova saw her net just one quarterfinal result, with a run to the last eight on home soil, in Moscow, where she lost to Markéta Vondroušová, besides taking a loss in the hands of youngster Leylah Fernandez in the third round of Indian Wells, despite having led by a set and a break in the latter. She finished her year by helping her nation claim its first Billie Jean King Cup in more than a decade, where the Russian Tennis Federation beat Switzerland in the final. On 8 November, Pavlyuchenkova surpassed her prior 10-year-old career-high ranking of world No. 13 when she hit the No. 11 ranking, and subsequently concluded 2021 ranked the same, her career-best year-end ranking to date. She began 2022 season at the Australian Open, having missed the warm-up tournaments after contracting COVID-19 on arrival. She defeated Anna Bondár and Samantha Stosur to reach the third round, beating Stosur in her last career singles match. However, she was beaten by Sorana Cîrstea in three sets. She was scheduled to compete at the St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy, but withdrew due to a knee injury. Pavlyuchenkova later announced that she would be ruled out of action for ten weeks due to her knee injury, and would be back in late April in time for the clay-court season. At the Italian Open, partnering Veronika Kudermetova, she won her second WTA 1000 doubles title, after the one in Madrid in 2013, defeating Madrid champions Gabriela Dabrowski and Giuliana Olmos. Pavlyuchenkova subsequently ended her season, after withdrawing from the French Open to continue nursing the knee injury. Having been defending her runner-up result from 12 months ago, her ranking dove nearly four-fold, from world No. 21 to No. 83 after the tournament's conclusion – making it the first time she is ranked outside the top 50, since she debuted here more than 13 years ago, on 3 November 2008. In singles, she entered the 2023 Australian Open with a protected ranking. In doubles, she partnered Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina and reached the third round defeating fifth seeded pair of Ukrainian Lyudmyla Kichenok and Latvian Jeļena Ostapenko en route. Using also protected ranking at the 2023 Italian Open she won her first round match against wildcard Sara Errani but lost to top seed Iga Świątek in the second round by a double bagel in a little over an hour match. Ranked No. 333, she reached the fourth round at the 2023 French Open defeating compatriot 24th seed Anastasia Potapova and becoming the second-lowest ranked player to reach the last 16 at this major in the Open Era following Serena Williams, who was ranked No. 451 when she made that stage in 2018. Next she defeated 28th seed Elise Mertens to reach her eighth major quarterfinal and her third at the French Open. She became only the third player ranked outside the WTA top 250 to reach a major quarterfinal, after Martina Hingis at the 2006 Australian Open and Kaia Kanepi at the 2017 US Open. As of 2021, her clothing sponsor was Lacoste, and her racquet sponsor is Wilson. She endorsed the Wilson Burn range of racquets. In February 2022, she condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying "personal ambitions or political motives cannot justify violence". She did not compete in the 2022 Wimbledon Championships due to the All England Club's decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In July 2023, she was among the Russian and Belarusian players that were not allowed to enter the Czech Republic ahead of the 2023 Prague Open. They competed as neutrals, without any national flag or symbol, but the Czech government passed a resolution banning all Russian and Belarusian athletes from entering the country due to the war in Ukraine.
