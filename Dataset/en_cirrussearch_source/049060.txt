SOR Libchavy (Sdružení Opravárenství a Rozvoje) is a Czech manufacturer of buses for urban, intercity and tourist traffic and trolleybuses. It was established in Libchavy in 1991. Until 1990, the company produced and repaired agricultural machinery. Then privatization took place and the new company was registered on 6 December 1991. The manufacturer was established with business intent to focus on the design, production, sale and service of buses. The company management decided to develop a 7.5 m long bus which would combine SOR's own body and chassis with engine-gearbox assembly from prominent world manufacturers. The production of buses was introduced by Jaroslav Trnka, the former director of Karosa Vysoké Mýto, and his team. Design works were initiated at the end of 1992 and already at the end of 1993, the first buses with Perkins motor and Voith gearbox were sold in 1994 to Kadaň. The company produced a wide range of different-sized buses (8.5 m, 9.5 m, 10.5 m, 12 m, 13.5 m and 18 m long). SOR Libchavy is currently producing about 750 vehicles per year and is the second largest manufacturer of buses in the Czech Republic, behind Iveco-Karosa. About one third is delivered abroad. The company has offices in the Baltics, Slovakia, Poland, Romania and Russia. Their buses run for example in the Czech capital Prague, or Slovak capital Bratislava.
