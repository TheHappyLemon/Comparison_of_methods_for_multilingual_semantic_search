Matías Nicolás Viña Susperreguy (born 9 November 1997) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a left-back or left wing-back for Campeonato Brasileiro Série A club Flamengo and the Uruguay national team. Viña was signed by Nacional in 2015 when he was 17 years old. He joined the Fourth Division and had the opportunity to practice with the professional team. One year later, Viña achieved his first minutes with the club's reserve team, having played eight games in the Third Division. On 31 January 2020, Viña left the club to join Série A side Palmeiras, where he won the treble consisting of the Campeonato Paulista, Copa Libertadores and Copa do Brasil. In August 2021, he signed for A.S. Roma. On 30 January 2023, Viña joined Premier League club AFC Bournemouth on loan until the end of the season, with an option to buy for €15 million. On 15 April, he scored his first goal for the club following his first ever start, coming in a 3–2 away win at Tottenham Hotspur. He returned to Roma after Bournemouth opted not to make the transfer permanent and joined fellow Italian club Sassuolo on loan. On 25 January 2024, Viña signed a four-year contract with Brazilian Série A club Flamengo, for a reported fee of €9 million. Making his debut in 2016 for the Uruguay under-20 team in a friendly against Chile, Viña played in both the 2017 South American U-20 Championship, coming first, and in the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup, finishing in fourth place. He played 27 games for the youth selection, scoring four times. Viña made his senior international debut for Uruguay on 6 September 2019, coming on from the bench in a friendly against Costa Rica.
