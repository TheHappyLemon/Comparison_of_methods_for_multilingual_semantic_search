The Republic of Cameroon is divided into ten regions. In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, President Paul Biya signed decrees abolishing "provinces" and replacing them with "regions". Hence, all of the country's ten provinces are now known as regions. Most of these provinces were designated in the 1960s alongside Centre-South Province (split into Centre and South in 1983). At the same time, Adamawa and Far North Provinces were split from North Province. See summary of administrative history in Zeitlyn 2018.
