Jacques Doucet (19 February 1853 in Paris – 30 October 1929 in Neuilly-sur-Seine) was a French sailor who competed in the 1900 Summer Olympics. He was the crew member of the French boat Favorite 1, which won two silver medals in the races of the 2 to 3 ton class. He also participated in the Open class, but did not finish the race. A memoir by the French painter Charles Picart Le Doux suggests that Doucet did not survive World War I.
