Cyrille C. Verbrugge (9 November 1866 – 4 May 1929) was a Belgian fencer who gained recognition for his achievements during the early 20th century. He particularly shone during the 1906 Intercalated Games, where he secured two gold medals. These Games, held in Athens, were considered at the time to be part of the Olympic tradition, although they are no longer recognized as such by the International Olympic Committee today. In addition to his 1906 accolades, Verbrugge also participated in the 1900 Paris Olympics, marking the start of his Olympic journey. His prowess in fencing led him to victories in the masters events at these early Olympic Games. In the 1906 Intercalated Games, Verbrugge won the gold medal in the Sabre, Masters, Individual, Men category, outclassing the only other competitor, Ioannis Raisis from Greece. Moreover, he clinched another gold in the masters épée event, where Raisis secured a third-place finish. It's noteworthy that the Sabre and Épée for fencing masters, or teaching professionals, were only featured in the Olympics during 1900 and 19063.
