Romain Ghanem Paul Saïss (Arabic: رومان غانم بول سايس; born 26 March 1990) is a professional footballer who plays as a centre-back or defensive midfielder for Saudi Pro League club Al-Shabab, on loan from Qatar Stars League club Al Sadd. Born in France, he captains the Morocco national team. Saïss began his career with Valence, then played for Le Havre and Clermont of Ligue 2, and Angers of Ligue 1 before joining Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2016. He made 206 appearances and scored 15 goals, before moving to Beşiktaş in 2021. Romain Saïss holds French and Moroccan nationalities. He represents Morocco at international level. A full international since 2012, he has earned over 80 caps for Morocco, becoming the team's captain in 2019. He has represented the nation at four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments and two FIFA World Cups, helping the team come fourth at the 2022 edition of the latter. Saïss began his senior career with Valence in the Championnat de France Amateur 2 (fifth-tier), and supplemented his €500 monthly salary with washing up at his parents' restaurant. At 21, he signed his first professional contract with Clermont in Ligue 2. In June 2013, Saïss moved across Ligue 2 to Le Havre on a two year deal. When it ended, he joined Ligue 1 side Angers on a two-year contract. On 30 August 2016, Saïss moved to England, joining EFL Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers for an undisclosed fee on a four-year deal. He made his debut on 17 September in a 2–0 win at Newcastle United. In the game, he was subjected to racial abuse by opponent Jonjo Shelvey, who was given a five-match ban and £100,000 fine by The FA in December. He scored his first goal for the club on 30 September 2017 in a 4–0 win against Burton Albion. Following Wolves' promotion to the Premier League in 2018, Saïss made his debut Premier League appearance as a substitute in a 1–1 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford on 22 September 2018. His first start in the Premier League came in a 2–1 defeat away to Cardiff City at the Cardiff City Stadium on 30 November. He scored his first Premier League goal in a 1–1 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage on 26 December 2018. On 21 February 2019 he agreed a new contract until the summer of 2021. On 25 July 2019 Saïss made his debut appearance in UEFA European club football competition as a late substitute in Wolves's 2–0 home win against Crusaders in the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League Second Qualifying Round and on 24 October he scored his first goal in such a competition when he scored the opening goal of a 2–1 away win at Slovan Bratislava in the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League group stage. Saïss triggered an automatic one-year extension to his contract on 18 March 2021, by making 20 starts in the Premier League during the 2020–21 season, tying him to the club until June 2022. He was described as the Moroccan Maldini by head coach Bruno Lage on 15 December that year, after his display in the away Premier League tie at Brighton & Hove Albion, where he scored the only goal in a much longed-for win (Wolves's first-ever win at Brighton in the top-flight in seven attempts dating back to 1979). He made his 100th appearance in the Premier League in 2–0 win away to Tottenham Hotspur on 13 February 2022. His 200th competitive appearance in all competitions for Wolves was on 5 March 2022 in a home fixture against Crystal Palace. On 31 May 2022, Saïss announced that he would leave Wolves at the end of his contract on 1 July, having played 206 games for the club over six seasons, and scoring 15 goals, nine of them in the Premier League. On 14 June 2022, Saïss moved to Turkey, signing a two-year contract with Süper Lig club Beşiktaş. He made his debut on 6 August as the season began with a 1–0 home win over Kayserispor. On 24 July 2023, Saïss signed a two-year contract with Qatar Stars League club Al Sadd, for a reported fee of €2.5 million, which could rise to €2.8 million with add-ons. On 5 September 2023, after making just 3 appearances for Al Sadd, the Qatari side sent Saïss on a season-long loan to Saudi Pro League club Al-Shabab. Saïss, who was born and raised in France to a Moroccan father and a French mother, chose to represent the Morocco national team. He made his debut in a 1–0 friendly loss to Togo in November 2012. Saïss was in the Moroccan squad that reached the quarter-finals of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon. He scored his first international goal in their 3–1 group win over Togo. In June 2018, he was named in Morocco's 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, and featured in group games against Iran and Spain.[citation needed] After the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, in which Morocco made the last 16, Saïss became the captain of the Atlas Lions. On 10 November 2022, Saïss was named in Morocco's 26-man squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. He scored the opening goal of a 2–0 group stage victory over Belgium on 27 November, Morocco's first goal of the tournament. The goal had previously been awarded to Abdelhamid Sabiri, but Saïss was later credited for the goal by FIFA. In the semi-final against France – the first ever played by an African nation – he was substituted after 21 minutes due to injury as Morocco lost 2–0. On 28 December 2023, Saïss was amongst the 27 players selected by coach Walid Regragui to represent Morocco in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations. Saïss's father is Moroccan and his mother is French, both restaurant owners. He is a Muslim and observes fasting in the month of Ramadan.
