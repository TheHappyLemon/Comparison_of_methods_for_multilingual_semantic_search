The COVID-19 pandemic in Lithuania was a part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Lithuania in February 2020. On 18 March 2020, the first domestic case was confirmed, the first infected being an immediate family member of a known case. The first cases of community spread were found in the country on 19 March and the first related death occurred on 20 March 2020. The Lithuanian government initially declared a quarantine from 16 March to 30 March, but it was extended several times and was set to end on 16 June. On 17 June, the quarantine was lifted. Starting from 21 October and lasting until 4 November, the government implemented color-based zones throughout Lithuania, with green meaning fewer or light restrictions and red meaning tight and heavy restrictions. But due to the rising numbers, the government announced a national lockdown on 4 November. The lockdown was set to last until 29 November, but was later lengthened until 1 July 2021. On 17 September, the last municipality with no coronavirus cases, Birštonas, confirmed its first case. All 60 municipalities have since recorded at least one confirmed case of infection. The vaccination program began on 27 December 2020, as in the rest of the European Union. The first to receive the vaccine were healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients, followed by the elderly and other senior age groups with medical conditions. Lithuania vaccinated one-third of its population on 22 May 2021. As of 1 July 2022, 72.59% of Lithuania's population has received at least one dose, while 69.77% have received at least two, while 34.74% of the population has received a booster dose.

These municipalities do not have any additional restrictions. Yellow zones are municipalities with a moderate risk of coronavirus, where either 1) the infection rate is less than 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days and positive tests make 4 or more percent of all tests, or 2) where the rate is 25 to 150 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days and positive tests make up less than 4 percent of all tests. These municipalities would be encouraged to prepare for a possible virus spread and could be given additional restrictions on an individual basis by the government. Red zones are municipalities with a high risk of coronavirus, where either 1) the infection rate is more than 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days and positive tests make up 4 or more percent of all tests, and cases that are not related to known hotspots and outbreaks make up more than 30 percent of all confirmed cases per week or, 2) where the rate is more than 150 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days and unrelated cases make up 30 or more percent of all cases.

These municipalities could be considered to be put under lockdown, which includes lower public transport capacity, limit on public gatherings, mandatory masks in public and indoors, limit on retail and entertainment client capacity, prohibition on hospital and social care visits, recommendation to halt from religious gatherings, and would also require public sector and recommend private sector to work remotely. Due to the rising number of new cases, on 4 November the Lithuanian government decided to put the country under a nationwide lockdown, that sees stricter rules than the set-out red zone rules. The lockdown was set to last until 29 November but later enlengthened with more restrictions to 1 February 2021, and the risk zone system will not be in effect until after the nationwide restrictions are lifted.
