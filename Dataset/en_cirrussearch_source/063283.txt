The EuroBasket 2022 was the 41st edition of the EuroBasket championship organized by FIBA Europe. It was the first since it was agreed it would take place every four years, with a similar system of qualification as for the FIBA Basketball World Cup. It was originally scheduled to take place between 2 and 19 September 2021, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics to 2021, it was postponed to September 2022. Like the previous two editions, the tournament was co-hosted by four countries. Games in the group stage were held in the Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, and Italy. The knock-out phase was played in Berlin, Germany. The tournament featured three All-NBA First Team members, Nikola Jokić (Serbia), Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece) and Luka Dončić (Slovenia), making it one of the most anticipated tournaments in EuroBasket history. Spain won the final against France, achieving its fourth EuroBasket title in the last six tournaments. Germany secured the bronze medal on home soil after defeating Poland. For EuroBasket 2015 and 2017, FIBA Europe opened three bidding options for hosting: to host a preliminary group, to host the final round, or to host the entire tournament. In the end, each of these two tournaments was hosted in four cities in four countries. It was hosted by four nations for the third time. Seven countries submitted separate candidacies to host Eurobasket 2022:  Czech Republic (Prague)  Estonia (Tallinn)  Georgia (Tbilisi)  Germany (Cologne, group stage, and Berlin, final)  Hungary (Budapest)  Italy (Milan)  Slovenia (Ljubljana) Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany and Italy were selected as host countries on 15 July 2019 at the Central Board in Munich, Germany. The qualification started in November 2017, with nine teams participating in the pre-qualifiers, including the five eliminated teams from the 2019 World Cup European Pre-Qualifiers. The co-hosts (Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany and Italy) participated in qualifiers, despite having already qualified to the EuroBasket 2022. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia was expelled from the tournament and replaced by Montenegro. The official logo was unveiled on 16 December 2019. The draw took place on 29 April 2021 in Berlin, Germany. Each of the four hosts was granted the right to select a partner federation for commercial and marketing criteria. These teams would automatically be placed into the same group as their chosen partner country. The 24 qualified teams were seeded according to the FIBA Men's World Ranking. Russia was replaced by Montenegro. The following 44 referees were selected for the tournament.

During the game between Turkey and Georgia in Group A, Furkan Korkmaz and Duda Sanadze were ejected after a scuffle. Korkmaz was reportedly attacked when leaving the arena by Georgian players. The following day, the Turkish federation threatened to leave the tournament. After the game, the Turkish federation also submitted a complaint because the game clock ran for 22 seconds while the game was paused; this complaint was initially dismissed by FIBA. On 5 September, FIBA opened an investigation and ten days later, on 15 September, announced to have opened "disciplinary proceedings for engaging in unsportsmanlike conduct" against four players.
