Mark Hartigan (born October 15, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre, who played in the National Hockey League with the Atlanta Thrashers, Columbus Blue Jackets, Anaheim Ducks and the Detroit Red Wings. He currently resides in Fort McMurray, Alberta. Hartigan was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Atlanta Thrashers in 2002, after three seasons of NCAA hockey at St. Cloud State University. He first played for Atlanta and the Columbus Blue Jackets at the NHL level, and also saw extensive time with their respective AHL franchises, the Chicago Wolves and Syracuse Crunch. Hartigan was traded to the Anaheim Ducks along with Joe Motzko in exchange for Zenon Konopka and Curtis Glencross, on January 26, 2007. He played in only 6 regular season games and one playoff game during the Ducks' successful run for the Stanley Cup in 2007, therefore his name was not put on the cup. He was, however, awarded a Stanley Cup ring by the team. On July 16, 2007, Hartigan was signed as a free agent by the Detroit Red Wings, playing 23 regular season games (3G, 1A), and 4 playoff games. Detroit won the Stanley Cup in 2008. However Hartigan did not play enough games, and again his name was not put on the Stanley Cup. He was, however, again given a Stanley Cup ring by the team. Hartigan played the last four seasons of his career in Europe, before announcing his retirement after his final season with Linköpings HC in the Swedish Elitserien.
