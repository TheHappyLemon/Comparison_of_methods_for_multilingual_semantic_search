After a landslide destroyed their original settlement, these settlers established a village in The Bottom. The original name of the village was De Botte, old Dutch for "The Bowl", referring to its geographical position in a valley surrounded by the various mountains. "The Bottom" is an English corruption of this name. After the Dutch settlers, Irish, English, and Scottish settlers followed, along with enslaved Africans, and the main language of the island's villages became English. By the 1860s, The Bottom was one of 7 main districts, with St. John's, Windwardside, Booby Hill, Mary's Point (Palmetto Point), Hell's Gate, and Middle Island. The Bottom district had its own elected head, as did the other districts. In 1865, the population of The Bottom was 616 inhabitants.
