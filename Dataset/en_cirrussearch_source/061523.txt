She was also assigned to compete at the 2020 World Championships, but these were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the pandemic continuing to limit international events, Ryabova competed at the 2020 Rostelecom Cup, placing ninth. In December, she left coaches Evgeni Plushenko and Alexander Volkov, citing being "no longer satisfied with the training conditions." She returned to her previous coaches, her parents, Alexei Ryabov and Ekaterina Bandurina.

Days after the Olympics concluded, Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine, as a result of which the International Skating Union banned all Russian and Belarusian skaters from competing at the 2022 World Championships. However, Ryabova was still allowed to compete since she represented Azerbaijan. Ryabova placed ninth in the short program. Eleventh in the free skate, she remained ninth overall.
