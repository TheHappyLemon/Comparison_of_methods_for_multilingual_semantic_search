Abruka Lighthouse (Estonian: Abruka tagumine tuletorn) is a lighthouse located on the island of Abruka, in the region of Saaremaa in western Estonia. The first lighthouse in Abruka was built in 1897, a 28-metre-high (92 ft) wooden structure, which had a form of a trellised wooden candelabrum. The current lighthouse was built in 1931, replacing the former wooden structure; the current lighthouse was designed by engineer Ferdinand Adoff, and constructed by Arronet and Boustedt. The lighthouse is 36 metres high, but only 2 metres in diameter, with its cylindrical reinforced concrete structure painted white with three black bands.
