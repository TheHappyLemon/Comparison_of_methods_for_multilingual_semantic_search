Meerane (German: [meˈʁaːnə] ) is a town in the Zwickau district of Saxony, Germany. It lies midway between the towns of Altenburg and Zwickau, west of Chemnitz. As of 31 December 2015, there were 14,851 inhabitants. The population has declined from a peak of over 26,000 in the 1940s. Meerane was once important for the manufacture of woollen and mixed cloths; associated industries such as dyeworks, tanneries and machine factories were also located there. The first documented mention of the settlement was in reference to the death of Vladislav II, who died in 1174 after a stay of four months at 'Burg Mare'. The Sorbian word "Mer" means "border", and the placename most likely refers to the borderlands between Slavic and Germanic speaking peoples at that time. In 1546 there were 193 inhabitants, in 1583 120 property holders and in 1750 100 houses in the town and 159 houses in the vicinity.
