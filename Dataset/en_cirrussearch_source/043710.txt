Alessandro Florenzi Cavaliere OMRI (born 11 March 1991) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a full-back for Serie A club AC Milan. Florenzi started his professional club career with Roma in 2011, but spent the 2011–12 season on loan with Crotone. Florenzi was appointed as Roma's new captain following the departure of Daniele De Rossi in 2019. He later had spells on loan with Spanish side Valencia, and French side Paris Saint-Germain, winning the Trophée des Champions and the Coupe de France with the latter club during the 2020–21 season. At international level he was a member of the Italy national under-21 football team that finished second in the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, and also represented the Italy senior side at UEFA Euro 2016 and UEFA Euro 2020, winning the latter tournament.

On 16 September 2017, he made his return in Roma's 3–0 home victory over Hellas Verona. On 30 January 2020, Florenzi was loaned to Valencia CF until 30 June 2020. On 11 September 2020, Florenzi joined Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain on a season-long loan with an option to buy. He was given the number 24 shirt. Two days later, he made his debut for PSG in a 0–1 loss against Marseille. On 2 October 2020, Florenzi scored his first goal at the Parisian club, in a match against Angers that ended in a 6–1 victory. On 19 May 2021, Florenzi started for PSG in their 2–0 win over Monaco in the 2021 Coupe de France Final. His loan ended on 30 June 2021. On 21 August 2021, AC Milan announced the signing of Florenzi from Roma on an initial loan deal, with the option to make the transfer permanent. Florenzi signed for the team until 30 June 2022. On First of October, Florenzi underwent surgery to his partially torn medial meniscus in his left knee. He was back on the pitch almost after 2 months against Fiorentina. He scored his first goal for Milan on 22 December against Empoli in eventual 4–2 win, it was also his first goal from a free-kick in Serie A. On 6 April 2022, he underwent a surgery on his left knee to repair the internal meniscus. On 8 May against Verona, he played his first match since the injury, coming on as a substitute and scoring the third in 3–1 win for Milan. In total, Florenzi played 30 matches for Milan this season, scoring 2 goals, contributing to the club's 19th Scudetto; it was Florenzi's first Serie A title. On 1 July 2022, AC Milan announced the signing of Florenzi from Roma on a permanent basis. The defender has signed a contract with the club lasting until 30 June 2025. He suffered a hamstring injury in early September 2022, and was successfully operated by surgeon Lasse Lempainen in Turku, Finland. On 14 November 2012, Florenzi made his debut for the senior team under coach Cesare Prandelli in a friendly match against France. Florenzi was part of the Italy under-21 squad for the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Israel, as the Azzurrini reached the final, losing to Spain 4–2. Florenzi's only goal of the tournament came in the 4–0, group stage, victory over the host nation. On 15 October 2013, Florenzi scored his first senior goal on his competitive debut in a World Cup qualifying match against Armenia that ended in a 2–2 draw at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples. Florenzi was not included in the 30-man preliminary squad named by Cesare Prandelli for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. On 30 August 2014, new Italy head coach Antonio Conte named Florenzi in his first squad for the upcoming European qualifying matches. On 31 May 2016, he was named to Conte's 23-man Italy squad for UEFA Euro 2016. In June 2021, he was included in Italy's squad for UEFA Euro 2020 by manager Roberto Mancini. On 11 July, Florenzi won the European Championship with Italy following a 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory over England at Wembley Stadium in the final, after a 1–1 draw in extra-time; he made a substitute appearance during the final, replacing Emerson Palmieri late in the second half of extra-time. Florenzi is a tenacious, tactically intelligent and well-rounded player who is extremely versatile. Although initially he was usually deployed as a central midfielder, in the "mezzala" role, he is a box-to-box player capable of playing anywhere in midfield, and he has recently also been deployed as a winger, and even as an attacking full-back or wing-back on either flank throughout his career, although he favours the right side. Florenzi is a quick, energetic and hard-working player who is effective at aiding his team both offensively and defensively due to his pace and stamina; when used in more offensive midfield roles, he has also demonstrated an aptitude for making offensive runs. He is gifted with good technical skills, distribution, and crossing ability, and despite his small stature, he is effective in the air; he is also a good striker of the ball, and an accurate set-piece taker. Florenzi has cited Cesc Fàbregas as his role model.
