Luis Jan Piers Advíncula Castrillón (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈlwis aðˈβiŋkula]; born 2 March 1990) is a Peruvian professional footballer who plays for Argentine Primera División club Boca Juniors and the Peru national team as a right-back. A quick and offensive right-back, he can play as a right winger. Advíncula started his career in the lower divisions of Juan Aurich and made his professional debut for the club in 2009. He was transferred in January 2010 to Sporting Cristal, where he made ninety-one appearances between 2010-2012. On 17 April 2012, the Houston Dynamo from the United States submitted a bid for Advíncula, but the deal fell apart at the last minute. On 19 July 2012, his move to SC Tavriya Simferopol from Ukraine was confirmed, but he returned to Sporting Cristal after only one month because the club did not meet the quota for Advíncula. On 5 January 2013, Advíncula signed a four-year contract with German club TSG 1899 Hoffenheim of the Bundesliga. Advíncula joined brazilian club Ponte Preta on a six-month loan on 10 July 2013, being recommended to the club by manager Paulo César Carpegiani. Although he was expected to be the starting right-back for the Macaca after the departure of Cicinho, the Peruvian player only managed to make four appearances for the club, as he was usually the third-choice on the right side of the defence, behind Artur and Régis. He fell out of favor with manager Jorginho, calling the player "technically weak". He was released from the club on 29 October. On 19 August 2014, he joined Vitória de Setúbal on a one-year loan. On 29 July 2018, Advíncula returned to Europe, this time to La Liga's Rayo Vallecano on loan for one year. A year later, after a good season at Rayo Vallecano, it was said that club had decided to redeem the players buying option, especially after a very well played Copa America with Peru. However, because Rayo was relegated from La Liga in the season he was at the club, it was said that he would be sold from Rayo after they had redeemed him. After playing play-offs, on 20 June 2021, Rayo was promoted to the first division of La Liga with Advíncula as a substitute In July 2021, Advinicula was transferred to Boca Juniors, after the club reached an agreement with Rayo. He scored Boca’s only goal in the 2023 Copa Libertadores final that they ended up losing 2-1 after extra time. Advíncula has been capped for the U-20 Peruvian national team where he played in the South American U-20 in 2009. His senior team debut was on 4 September 2010, in a friendly against Canada. His second match was against Jamaica in another friendly match on 7 September of that same year. He was also summoned by coach Sergio Markarian to play the Copa America 2011 in Argentina. Advíncula also took part in the starting eleven in the second leg of the intercontinental play-off against New Zealand on 15 November 2017. He played a crucial part in the outcome of the 2–0 victory over New Zealand, helping Peru qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Peru's first World Cup since 1982. In May 2018, he was named in Peru’s final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. He played all three group matches as his side were knocked out of the tournament. On 9 September 2018, he scored his first international goal in a 2–1 friendly loss to Germany. On 13 June 2022, after missing a penalty in the decisive World Cup playoff match against Australia as his opponents made the finals he retired from international football aged just 32.
