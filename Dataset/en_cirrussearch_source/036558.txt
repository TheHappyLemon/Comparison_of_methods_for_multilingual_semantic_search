The 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup football tournament was the seventh FIFA Confederations Cup. It was held in Germany between 15 June and 29 June 2005, as a prelude to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The tournament was won by 2002 FIFA World Cup winners Brazil, who defeated Argentina 4–1 in the final at the Waldstadion in Frankfurt. The final was a rematch of the Copa América final also won by Brazil. It was Brazil's second win at the Confederations Cup. Originally, Kaiserslautern's Fritz-Walter-Stadion was also intended as a venue. However, on 27 May 2004, city authorities withdrew from the bidding process, citing added costs to complete the stadium on time as the reason for the withdrawal. All five venues were reused for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The official match ball for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup was the Adidas Pelias 2.

Since both competitions award their winners a place in the Confederations Cup, the runners-up in the Copa América 2004 were called to play. "Argentina seal sixth FIFA Confederations Cup berth".
