Nokia's Series 80 (formerly Crystal) was a short-lived mobile software platform for their enterprise and professional level smartphones, introduced in 2000. It uses the Symbian OS. Common physical properties of this Symbian OS user interface platform are a screen resolution of 640×200 pixels and a full QWERTY keyboard. Series 80 used the large size of the Communicator screens to good effect, but software had to be developed specifically for it, for a relatively small market. The final Series 80 device was the Nokia 9300i, announced in 2005 and shipped in 2006. Nokia used S60 3rd Edition instead of the Series 80 platform on its final "Communicator" branded device, the Nokia E90 Communicator, released in 2007.
