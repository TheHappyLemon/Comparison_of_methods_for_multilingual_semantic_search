Masami Ihara (井原 正巳, Ihara Masami, born September 18, 1967) is a Japanese former footballer and manager. He is the currently head coach of J1 League club of Kashiwa Reysol. A defender, Ihara was captain of the Japan national team for more than a decade in the 1990s, together with striker Kazuyoshi Miura and Brazilian-born midfielder Ruy Ramos. Ihara's long standing record of 122 national team appearances was surpassed by Yasuhito Endo on October 16, 2012. Ihara was rarely out of the spotlight in the emerging J1 League throughout the 1990s. He spent most of his career with Yokohama F. Marinos and formed a key defensive partnership with the flamboyant Tsuyoshi Kitazawa at club level. After graduating from University of Tsukuba, he joined Nissan Motors (later Yokohama Marinos) and rapidly rose through the Marinos youth ranks to become a key player. The long-serving Ihara was so important to his club that he was nicknamed Mister Marinos by many Japanese fans. He formed the backbone of the club and also helped to bring on talented youngsters like Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi and Shunsuke Nakamura. After leaving Marinos, Ihara also spent a season with Júbilo Iwata (2000) and his last two seasons with Urawa Reds (2001–2002). He retired in 2002. He played 341 games and scored 7 goals in the league. He was selected Best Eleven for six years in a row (1991–92 to 1997). He also was selected as part of the 30th Anniversary J.League Best Eleven. On January 27, 1988, when Ihara was a University of Tsukuba student, he debuted for Japan national team against United Arab Emirates. After his debut, he became a regular player playing the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification and at the 1990 Asian Games. In 1992, Japan won the AFC Asian Cup for the first time. However, at 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification, Japan failed to won for qualify to 1994 FIFA World Cup. After that, Ihara became a captain for Japan and played at 1995 King Fahd Cup and 1996 AFC Asian Cup. In 1997, at 1998 World Cup qualification, Japan achieved qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup for the first time. During the 1998 World Cup in France, the veteran sweeper's experience was crucial to Japan's survival in their very first World Cup appearance, forming a flat back three defence with strong centre-back Yutaka Akita as well as speedy fullbacks Eisuke Nakanishi (or strong centre-back Norio Omura). Young Marinos goalkeeper, Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi was Japan's first choice goalkeeper at the time. After 1998 World Cup, he played at 1999 Copa América. This competition was his last game for Japan. He played 122 games and scored 5 goals for Japan until 1999. In 2006, Ihara became the assistant coach for the Japan U-23 national team and spent two years. He then became the assistant coach for club Kashiwa Reysol in 2009, being the caretaker on two occasions. After a horrible three years of being at the bottom half of the table in the J2 League, Avispa Fukuoka then hired Ihara as their coach, replacing the former Marijan Pušnik. Under Ihara, then club went on to win 24 games out of 42 and collected a total of 82 points, ending their regular season in third place. Avispa then went on to the playoffs, where they beat V-Varen Nagasaki 1–0, and then drew 1–1 against Cerezo Osaka. Avispa eventually ended up getting promoted to the J1 League as they were the higher-seeded team. Ihara's first match in charge of Avispa in the 2016 J1 League was a 2–1 away loss against Sagan Tosu. The first win in the league was on their eighth match in a 1–0 away win in Tokyo against FC Tokyo. He resigned at the end of the 2018 season.
