His great-grandfather, Raoul Ulliel (1889–1943), was a bronzesmith who distinguished himself in combat during World War I. His paternal grandmother was of Italian and Spanish descent. He had a scar on his left cheek as a result of a doberman attacking him with its claws when he attempted to ride the dog like a horse at the age of six.

Ulliel began acting while he was still at school, at eleven years old, when a friend of a friend of his mother was working at an agency and was looking for young actors. She asked Ulliel if he wanted to give it a try and he said "yes", but just for fun. It was only after he turned seventeen that he really decided to continue working in this industry. He left the University of Saint-Denis after two years because he was getting more offers as an actor, but he still dreamed about writing and directing his own film, stating in a 2011 interview for Anthem Magazine; "I wake up every morning with this idea stuck in my mind that I want to write and direct my own film one day. As I work more and more on different sets, I see how hard it is to be a director. It's insane the amount of work and confidence that goes into it. I’m so respectful of filmmakers and I admire what they do. I hope that one day I'll find the right subject and the confidence to try it. I'm still young." He made his acting debut with a small part in one episode of Une femme en blanc, a 1997 miniseries for French television starring Sandrine Bonnaire.

On 18 February 2022, Canal Plus confirmed to France's Le HuffPost that actor Niels Schneider will replace Ulliel in the miniseries. Ulliel and Schneider were friends and co-stars in the films One Nation, One King (2018) and Sibyl (2019). In 2003, at the age of 19, Ulliel walked the runway for the first and only time for Hedi Slimane's Dior Homme Autumn/Winter 2003 fashion show entitled "Luster".

In 2015, Ulliel signed The Calais Appeal, which asked the French government for an emergency plan to end the undignified living conditions that migrants and refugees were facing in the Calais Jungle. In August 2018, he signed a petition supporting Aquarius, the humanitarian ship chartered by the European sea rescue organization SOS Méditerranée and carried out in partnership with Doctors Without Borders, demanding the ship to be allowed to return to the sea and continue to rescue people in mortal danger in international waters after being prevented from saving refugees and turned back from the rescue zone off the coast of Libya in June 2018. In November 2018, he signed French magazine L'Express's petition against homophobic attacks. In 2020, he was one of the signatories of the tribune "Académie des Césars : nous n'avons aucune voix au chapitre" ("César Academy: we have no voice in the matter"), published on 10 February 2020 on the website of the French newspaper Le Monde asking for an in-depth reform of the César Awards Academy to remedy its "elitist and closed" functioning. In March 2021, he signed the petition of France's Society of Film Directors (SRF) entitled "Un jour sans fin" ("An Endless Day"), asking President Emmanuel Macron to reopen theaters in France following a decision to close them in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

While supporting the Monte-Carlo Gala for Planetary Health in September 2021, he said: "We are facing an unprecedented ecological crisis. Never before has our planet and life on earth been so threatened. [...] I want to be part of those fighting to leave a healthy planet for our future generations. Let's see this as a hopeful wake-up call. It is still within our reach, but not for long - we have entered this highly decisive period. Today, there are no more important concerns or priorities to address." On 18 January 2022 at around 4:00 pm, Ulliel was critically injured while skiing at the La Rosière resort in Savoie, France, when he collided with another skier at an intersection between two blue/intermediate slopes after turning left, presumably to join his friends on an adjoining slope, and suffered serious brain trauma. Ulliel was airlifted by helicopter to the trauma unit of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes in nearby La Tronche, where he died the following day around 4:00 p.m. at the age of 37. According to French magazine Paris Match, Ulliel arrived brain dead at the hospital. Ulliel's parents along with his last partner, Gäelle Pietri, decided to donate his organs, saving the lives of six people. An investigation indicated that both skiers fell to the ground after the collision, and that Ulliel was motionless and unconscious when rescuers arrived. The director of the La Rosière resort, Jean Regaldo, told France's BFM TV that Ulliel was not wearing a helmet when rescuers arrived. Helmets are not required on French ski slopes. Regaldo also said weather conditions were "perfect" at the time of the accident and that there were no rocks in the area of the collision, which he described as easily accessible. The other skier, a Lithuanian man in his forties, was wearing a helmet and was not injured. He told the investigators that the collision was not too violent. Upon hearing the Lithuanian skier and other eyewitnesses of the accident, the public prosecutor of Albertville, Anne Gaches, stated that wearing a helmet "would not necessarily have changed things", and that "it was not noted excessive speed, inappropriate behavior or fault of one of the two skiers". Following their testimonies, the prosecutor also declared that the two skiers were moving side by side when they collided. "For the moment, it is difficult to say whether it was the shock or the fall that led to Mr. Ulliel's death", she said. Gaches also stated that no autopsy would be performed on Ulliel's body. The resort offered psychological support for both the Lithuanian skier, who was very shocked, and for Ulliel's friends and relatives. Ulliel was on vacation at the resort with his friends. On 27 January 2022, a memorial service for Ulliel was held at the Church of St. Eustache in Paris. It was attended by nearly a thousand people, including his family, friends and co-stars such as Audrey Tautou, Marion Cotillard, Louis Garrel, Jérémie Rénier (who also acted as a pallbearer), Isabelle Huppert, Vincent Lindon, Niels Schneider, Nathalie Baye, Léa Seydoux and Vincent Cassel. He was buried in a private ceremony at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. The La Rosière resort also paid tribute to Ulliel by stopping the ski lifts for one minute at 3:58 pm, which was the time of his accident on 18 January. On 18 January 2023, a year after the accident, Albertville's public prosecutor, Anne Gaches, announced to French radio station RTL that the investigation on the accident had been officially closed with no further action several months before. Justice has officially cleared the Lithuanian skier of all responsibilities and he will not be subjected to any prosecution. Among those who paid tribute to Ulliel following his death were France's president Emmanuel Macron, who described Ulliel as "an icon of French elegance who dazzled the cameras", France's Prime Minister Jean Castex, and France's Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot, as well as peers and collaborators such as Xavier Dolan, Martin Scorsese, Marion Cotillard, Isabelle Huppert, Juliette Binoche, Chanel, Disney, Cannes Film Festival director Thierry Fremaux, Cannes Film Festival president Pierre Lescure, Jean Dujardin, Peter Webber, Pierre Niney, Louis Garrel, André Téchiné, and Bertrand Bonello. On 25 February 2022, the 47th César Awards ceremony opened with a tribute video to Ulliel featuring his last scene in the 2016 film It's Only the End of the World, and a message on the screen that read "this ceremony is dedicated to Gaspard Ulliel". Later in the evening, Xavier Dolan, who directed Ulliel in It's Only the End of the World, paid a tribute to him in the form of a letter addressed to Ulliel's mother, which he finished by saying "Because a mother's love is stronger than anything. I believe it. Stronger than life. Stronger than art itself. And certainly stronger than death." Dolan's speech was followed by the ceremony's "In Memoriam" segment, which also began with a tribute to Ulliel featuring scenes from the films A Very Long Engagement and Saint Laurent. On 27 February 2022, Ulliel was honored in the "In Memoriam" segment from the 28th SAG Awards ceremony, which featured his last scene in A Very Long Engagement. Despite not being mentioned during the Oscars' In Memoriam segment on 27 March 2022, Ulliel was included in the online memorial from the official website of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences among other artists who had died recently. On 13 April 2022, that week's episode of the Marvel Studios miniseries Moon Knight, which featured Ulliel guest starring in the role of Anton Mogart, was dedicated to his memory with a tribute in the end credits. Marvel Studios also shared a tribute to Ulliel on their social media. Ulliel's last partner, Gaëlle Pietri, wrote a book paying tribute to him titled Le Temps de te dire adieu ("Time to Say Goodbye"), published on 26 April 2023. Following Ulliel's death, politicians and ski professionals urged for helmets to be made obligatory on the French slopes. Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains in Haute-Savoie, stated that they must impose helmet-wearing to reduce the risk of serious accidents and also reexamine on a case-by-case basis the dangerousness of different pistes and potentially reclassify their colors. When asked if helmets should be made compulsory for skiing in France – like they are in other European countries – during a press conference on 20 January 2022, government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said that it was "not the moment to begin a debate around the subject." It was reported that 97% of children under the age 12 do wear a helmet in France, but the National Mountain Safety Observation System noted that this percentage decreases as people get older. The Canadian Medical Association Journal estimates that wearing a helmet reduces the risk of head injury by 35%. Ulliel's death caused a rise in the number of ski helmet sales in France. On 19 February 2022, Ulliel's ex-girlfriend, Gaëlle Pietri, announced that the family wanted to honor his memory by contributing to the French non-governmental organization Tara Ocean Foundation, which has the mission of raising awareness about the impact of climate change and the current ecological crisis on the oceans. Pietri said: "Gaspard was a diver, sensitive to climate issues and concerned about the protection of underwater biodiversity, he would have liked the momentum generated by his death to go to the defense of these causes that were close to his heart." A special page was opened on the foundation's website in memory of Ulliel to support this cause.
