Group B of the 2010 FIFA World Cup began on 12 June and ended on 22 June 2010. The group consisted of Argentina, Nigeria, South Korea and Greece. It was the third time that Argentina and Nigeria had been drawn together in the same World Cup group, after 1994 (when Greece were also in the same group) and 2002. Argentina had also been paired with South Korea in 1986. Argentina won all three of their matches, conceding just one goal, and progressed as group winners. South Korea joined them in the knockout stage by virtue of their victory over Greece in the opening match and a draw with Nigeria in the last. That point was the only one Nigeria won, having also lost to Greece in their second match.

South Korea advanced to play Uruguay (winners of Group A) in the round of 16. All times local (UTC+2) In the seventh minute, Ki Sung-yong's free kick near the left corner was inadvertently flicked on by Kostas Katsouranis, before Lee Jung-soo rushed to the back post to open the scoring. The Koreans' lead was doubled through captain Park Ji-sung, who tackled Loukas Vyntra and sprinted all the way to fire a low shot into the corner of the net as they kept their 2–0 win until the final whistle. 12 June 2010 13:30 Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Port Elizabeth Attendance: 31,513 Referee: Michael Hester (New Zealand) On six minutes, an unmarked Gabriel Heinze dived forward to head home Juan Sebastián Verón's corner kick and put Argentina 1–0 up. Lionel Messi had numerous chances for Argentina following that, but on each occasion, Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama was able to keep the margin down to one. Enyeama's saves earned him the man of the match award. Post-match, Argentina coach Diego Maradona said he was confident his side would perform well in the future. 12 June 2010 16:00 Ellis Park Stadium, Johannesburg Attendance: 55,686 Referee: Wolfgang Stark (Germany) Argentina took the lead when Lionel Messi's free kick from the left was turned into the Korean goal by Korean player Park Chu-young. A free kick was awarded on the left, and Messi's cross was headed in by Gonzalo Higuaín. In first half injury time, Korea cut the deficit when Lee Chung-yong tackled Martín Demichelis to score. Two goals from Argentina in the second half sealed a 4–1 win. Messi's shot was first saved by goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong; his second shot hit the post before Higuaín shot the ball into an unguarded net. Higuaín completed his hat-trick by heading in a cross from substitute Sergio Agüero. 17 June 2010 13:30 Soccer City, Johannesburg Attendance: 82,174 Referee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium) 17 June 2010 16:00 Free State Stadium, Bloemfontein Attendance: 31,593 Referee: Óscar Ruiz (Colombia) 22 June 2010 20:30 Moses Mabhida Stadium, Durban Attendance: 61,874 Referee: Olegário Benquerença (Portugal) 22 June 2010 20:30 Peter Mokaba Stadium, Polokwane Attendance: 38,891 Referee: Ravshan Irmatov (Uzbekistan) Argentina at the FIFA World Cup Greece at the FIFA World Cup Nigeria at the FIFA World Cup South Korea at the FIFA World Cup "Match Schedule 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa" (PDF).
