Jos√© Luis Gay√† Pe√±a (Catalan pronunciation: [d íoÀàze lwis Àà…°aja Ààpe…≤a]; born 25 May 1995) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a left-back for La Liga club Valencia, whom he captains, and the Spain national team. An academy graduate of Valencia, he made his senior debut in 2012 and went on to play more than 300 competitive matches for the club, winning the Copa del Rey in 2019. Gay√† appeared in his first full match with the Spain national team in 2018, being selected for Euro 2020. Born in Pedreguer, Alicante, Valencian Community, Gay√† was a product of Valencia CF's youth system, where he started playing as a striker ‚Äì scoring over 60 goals in one year ‚Äì before switching to left-back. He made his senior debut with the reserves when he was not even 17, playing 21 minutes in a 1‚Äì0 away win against Andorra CF in the Segunda Divisi√≥n B in what would be his only appearance of the season. On 30 October 2012, Gay√† appeared in his first official game with the main squad, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2‚Äì0 away victory over UE Llagostera in the round of 32 of the Copa del Rey. He made his first appearance in the UEFA Europa League on 12 December of the following year, in a 1‚Äì1 group stage home draw with FC Kuban Krasnodar. Gay√† played his first game in La Liga with the Che on 27 April 2014, starting and featuring the full 90 minutes in a 0‚Äì1 home loss against eventual champions Atl√©tico Madrid. On 3 August, he scored the first goal in a 3‚Äì1 defeat of S.L. Benfica in that year's Emirates Cup. Gay√† was made a starter by new manager Nuno Esp√≠rito Santo in the 2014‚Äì15 campaign. He scored his first goal as a professional and in the Spanish top flight on 25 September 2014, grabbing his team's second in the 3‚Äì0 home victory against C√≥rdoba CF. His second came in the domestic cup on 7 January of the following year, helping to a 2‚Äì1 win over RCD Espanyol also at the Mestalla Stadium. On 8 May 2015, he renewed his contract with the club, signing until 2020 with a ‚Ç¨50 million buyout clause. In May 2018, Gay√† agreed to a further extension until 2023 with his release clause increasing to ‚Ç¨100 million. That October, having been part of the side that kept a clean sheet against Manchester United in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, ESPN FC put him into their Champions League Best XI. He finished the season with his first honour, assisting Kevin Gameiro's opener in a 2‚Äì1 defeat of FC Barcelona in the 2019 Copa del Rey final. In March 2020, Gay√† and teammates Ezequiel Garay and Eliaquim Mangala tested positive for COVID-19 virus during the coronavirus pandemic in Spain. That August, due to the economic effects of the pandemic, the entire squad was put up for sale except him. Having previously filled in as captain in the absence of Dani Parejo, he took the role permanently as the midfielder was shipped to Villarreal CF. Gay√† skippered Valencia in the 2022 Copa del Rey final, in which he scored in the penalty shootout that the team lost to Real Betis. He was suspended for the first four matches of the following league season for criticising the referee's decisions in a game against CA Osasuna; his appeal was rejected at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. On 19 October that year, he extended his contract to last until 2027. Gay√† earned 34 caps for Spain across all youth levels. On 26 May 2015, he was called to the full side for a friendly with Costa Rica and a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Belarus, but did not make his debut on either occasion. Gay√† played his first match on 11 September 2018, featuring the entire 6‚Äì0 home rout of Croatia in the UEFA Nations League. On 3 September 2020, for the same competition, he scored the equalising goal in the 97th minute of a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Germany. On 24 May 2021, Gay√† was included in Luis Enrique's 24-man squad for Euro 2020. His input for the semi-finalists consisted of 77 minutes in the 5‚Äì3 extra time victory over Croatia in Copenhagen. Gay√† was called up for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. In the pre-tournament training camp in Jordan, he suffered a right ankle sprain, and was replaced by Alejandro Balde.
