Meteor-M No.1 was the first of the Russian Meteor-M series of polar-orbiting weather satellites. It was launched on a Soyuz-2.1b rocket with a Fregat upper stage on 17 September 2009. Meteor-M No.1 was the designated replacement for Meteor-3M No.1, and had a design life of 5 years. In November 2014, Russian officials announced the termination of the mission after a failure of the onboard attitude control system. Since its termination, the satellite has been heard on radio by amateur radio operators, even transmitting pictures of the Earth. Spaceflight portal Meteor Administrator.
