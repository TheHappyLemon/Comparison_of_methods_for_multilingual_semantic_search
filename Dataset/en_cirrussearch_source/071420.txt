AnimeFest is an annual four-day anime convention held during August at the Loews Arlington Hotel in Arlington, Texas. The convention typically offers autograph sessions, cosplay contests, and a masquerade. In 2012, the convention moved from the Hyatt Regency Dallas to the Sheraton Dallas Downtown Hotel. A-Kon also used the same hotel in 2012. AnimeFest in 2017 had issues with its autograph lines. AnimeFest 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. AnimeFest 2021 was initially cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and an online event held in its place. The convention would later hold an event in December 2021. "AnimeFest 2016 Information".
