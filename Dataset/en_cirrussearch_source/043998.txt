They compete in the Serbian First League, the second tier of the national league system. The club was founded as FK Radnik on 12 June 1961.

The club was immediately registered with the Čačak Football Subassociation and started competing in the local leagues. They would change their name to FK Metalac in 1965. The club made its first notable achievement by qualifying for the Yugoslav Cup in 1974, but lost away to Borac Travnik in the opening round.

The club subsequently won the Serbian League Morava in 2002 and would go on to play in the Second League until 2004. After spending three seasons in the third tier, the club became the Serbian League West champions in 2007, gaining promotion to the Serbian First League.
