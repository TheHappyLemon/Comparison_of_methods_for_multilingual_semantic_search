Poltava Oblast (Ukrainian: Полта́вська о́бласть, romanized: Poltavska oblast), also referred to as Poltavshchyna (Ukrainian: Полта́вщина), is an oblast (province) of central Ukraine. The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Poltava. Most of its territory was part of the southern regions of the Cossack Hetmanate. Population: 1,352,283 (2022 estimate). Three other important cities in the oblast are Horishni Plavni, Kremenchuk, and Lubny. The Poltava Oblast was established on 22 September 1937 according to the resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. It was based mostly on rayons (districts) that were part of Kharkiv Oblast and only few from Kyiv Oblast. The region somewhat corresponds to the earlier Poltava Governorate (1802-1925). During the Nazi Germany occupation in 1941-43, most of the region belonged to Kiew Generalbezirke (general district), while the rest was part of the German military rear area. After withdrawal of German forces, the region was reinstated almost to the same borders. In 1950s it lost some of its territories to Kyiv Oblast and the newly created Cherkasy Oblast as well as some were submerged under the Kremenchuk Reservoir in 1959. In 2020 as part of all Ukrainian administrative reform, Poltava Oblast decreased number of its raions by increasing them in size. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the town of Myrhorod was bombed. However as of August 2023, there has been no ground fighting and the province remains completely under Ukrainian control. Poltava Oblast is situated in the central part of Ukraine. Located on the left bank of the Dnieper, the Poltava region was part of the Cossack Hetmanate. It has an area of 28,800 km2. The oblast borders upon Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Cherkasy and Kyiv oblasts. The oblast does not contain any notable landforms apart from the Dnieper river, the land is gently undulating. The following historic-cultural sites were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine.

These are: Kremenchuk Raion (Кременчуцький район), the center is in the city of Kremenchuk; Lubny Raion (Лубенський район), the center is in the city of Lubny; Myrhorod Raion (Миргородський район), the center is in the city of Myrhorod; Poltava Raion (Полтавський район), the center is in the city of Poltava. Note: Asterisks (*) Though the administrative center of the raion is housed in the city that it is named after, cities do not answer to the raion authorities only towns do; instead they are directly subordinated to the oblast government and therefore are not counted as part of raion statistics. Most of Ukraine's oblasts are named after their capital cities, officially referred to as "oblast centers" (Ukrainian: обласний центр, translit. oblasnyi tsentr). The name of each oblast is a relative adjective, formed by adding a feminine suffix to the name of respective center city: Poltava is the center of the Poltavs'ka oblast' (Poltava Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix "-shchyna", as is the case with the Poltava Oblast, Poltavshchyna.
