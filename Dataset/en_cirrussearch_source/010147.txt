Sven Tumba (born Sven Olof Gunnar Johansson; 28 August 1931 – 1 October 2011) was one of the most prominent Swedish ice hockey players of the 1950s and 1960s. He also represented Sweden in football as well as golf and became Swedish champion in waterskiing. Johansson first became known as "Tumba" in the 1950s since there were other players with the same last name, and he grew up in the Swedish town of Tumba. In October 1960 he married his wife Mona, and five years later he, along with Mona, legally changed his family name to Tumba. Johansson was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1997. After his retirement from ice hockey, he became an accomplished golfer, a golf course designer, creator and organizer of golf exhibitions and tournaments, as well as an ambassador for the game of golf, even officially introducing the game of golf to the former Soviet Union. Tumba debuted for Swedish club Djurgårdens IF in the 1950–51 Division I season. Tumba played for the Djurgårdens IF until 1966, winning eight Swedish Championships. He was leading the league top goal scorer three years. In 1957, Tumba was the first European player to attend an NHL training camp, with the Boston Bruins. He reportedly received a $50,000 contract offer from the Bruins after scoring a goal against the New York Rangers in a preseason exhibition game as well as making five appearances for the Rangers Quebec Aces minor league team. However, Tumba turned down the offer as he would no longer have been eligible to play amateur hockey for the Swedish national team. In 1967–68, Tumba played on season with Malmö FF in the Swedish second division. Tumba had a lengthy international career, playing for Sweden at 14 IIHF World Championships, four Winter Olympics, named best forward at the 1957 and 1962 World Championships and top scorer at the 1964 Winter Olympics. He also captained the national team. As of 2010[update], Tumba holds the Swedish scoring record of 186 goals (in 245 games) for the Swedish national team. Djurgården has retired number 5 in his honor. In 1997, he was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame and was in 1999 awarded the "Best Swedish Ice-hockey Player of All Times", outvoting prominent players such as Peter Forsberg and Mats Sundin.

He was in the starting eleven for Djurgården's first European match, the first leg of the 1955–56 European Cup first round against Gwardia Warsaw. In 1959, he won the Swedish championship with Djurgården, becoming the internal top-scorer with 11 goals. He also represented the Sweden national team, where played one game for the national team against Norway on 16 September 1956. Djurgårdens IF: Allsvenskan: 1959 After a successful career in ice hockey and football, Tumba dedicated himself to golf as a player, golf course designer and ambassador of the sport. Tumba is widely recognized as an important, maybe the most important, person for introducing golf as a widely spread sport in Sweden. Having been introduced to the game of golf for the very first time, being over the age of 30, he reached a scratch handicap in 1970, at 39 years of age, when he, representing Stockholm Golf Club, also won the Scandinavian International Amateur Match-play Championship (one of three major amateur tournaments in Scandinavia at the time) and was selected, as one of the four best amateur players in the country, to the Swedish national team at the 1970 Eisenhower Trophy in Madrid, Spain. He turned professional the following year and in 1974, he qualified, as one of the two best professionals in the country, to represent Sweden at the 1974 World Cup in Caracas, Venezuela. However, concerning golf in Sweden, he is not firstly remembered for his record as a player, but for his contributions to popularizing the game and putting Sweden on the map of the world of golf. He toured around in Sweden as the main attraction in inaugurations and anniversaries at golf clubs, showing his popular golf clinic, playing exhibition matches and drawing attention in media and among people, who not formerly did know about the game. His successful efforts to organize exhibitions in Sweden with Arnold Palmer in 1968 and Jack Nicklaus in 1969, was followed by the professional invitation tournament Volvo Open, which took place in Sweden in 1970 and 1971. In 1973 the Scandinavian Enterprise Open tournament was established, with Tumba as its founder, and it soon became one of the richest ones on the European Tour. During the period of time for Tumbas golf career, the number of members in Swedish golf clubs increased 50 times, from around 12,000 at the beginning of the 1960s to approximately 600,000 in the middle of the 1990s. Golf awards In 1978, Tumba was, by the Swedish Golf Federation, awarded the Golden Club, the highest award for contributions to Swedish golf, as the first recipient. In 1985 he received The Merit Sign in Gold by the Swedish PGA. On the 100th anniversary of the Swedish Golf Federation in 2004, he was named the most influential person in the history of golf in that country, ahead of people such as all-time women's golf great Annika Sörenstam. In 2006, Tumba was awarded the Erik Runfelt medal, at the time the highest award from the Swedish Golf Federation. On 4 June 2022, Tumba was the seventh person to be inducted in the newly founded Swedish Golf Hall of Fame. Golf projects 1967: Tumba Golf Center, the first indoor driving range in Sweden.

Tumba was the son of engineer Torsten Johansson and his German-born wife Greta, née Kruse. He was survived by his wife Mona (née Nessim, b. 1941) and their four sons, Tommie, born 1962, Johan, born 1964, Stefan, born 1970 and Daniel, born 1982. Both Tommie and Johan became golf professionals. Johan previously played on the European Tour and finished tied 13th in the 1989 Scandinavian Enterprise Open and later became a successful professional long driving competitor. For most of his retirement, Sven Tumba and his wife lived in West Palm Beach, Florida, returning to Sweden summers. He died on 1 October 2011 after being on the Danderyd Hospital for three months due to an infection in the hip. At the time of his death, he was both a Swedish and an American citizen, but not registered as living in Sweden. He had the ambition to become that before his death, but quickly became too weak to manage necessary formality. He was subsequently honored prior to the Swedish hockey league Elitserien games that were played that day, with a one-minute silence. His body was buried at the Engelbrekt Church in Östermalm, Stockholm, on 20 October 2011. Approximately 500 friends and relatives arrived at the church to leave flowers and honour Sven Tumba. Tumba wrote numerous books: Tumba säger allt! (Tumba Says It All!), Tumbas ishockeyskola (Tumba's Ice Hockey School) (translated into three languages), as well as Mitt rika liv eller Den nakna sanningen (My Rich Life or the Naked Truth).
