Felicianova Manor is a Neo-Gothic manor house in Cibla Parish, Cibla Municipality in the historical region of Latgale, in Latvia. The origin of Felicianova's name is not clearly known, but there are two versions. According to first version Angel Dionizi the eldest son of Ignatius ruled Zabolotjes Manor and Ignatius second son Andrew - Eversmuiža Manor (1769), but Ignatius' brother, Felicians, was probably a temporary owner of the land of the expelled landlord Jan Bugvecki and had only begun to establish Felicianova's ( nova - new) half manor, or folverku, but already in 1786 Ozupine Manor owner is Zaremba. According to second version Felicia ( Felicia nova ) - female name, but no such name is known in this manor. Felicianova is a relatively new manor. In 1784 it was not yet in the general description of manors.

The Felicianov mill, too, has not yet existed, it is mentioned under Morozovka village and belonged to Eversmuiža. Ozupine then owned Mary Zaremba, from which the Plen family could buy land and build a significant estate, mainly due to industrial companies. Agriculture was less important. Of the 21 villages, eight became the property of Felicianov. At the time of the "souls" audit of 1858, the manor was already there. It remained the sole property of the Plen family until 1944.
