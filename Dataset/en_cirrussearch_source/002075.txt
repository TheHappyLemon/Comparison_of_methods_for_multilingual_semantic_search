30 (thirty) is the natural number following 29 and preceding 31. 30 is an even, composite, pronic number. With 2, 3, and 5 as its prime factors, it is a regular number and the first sphenic number, the smallest of the form 2×3×r{\displaystyle 2\times 3\times r}, where r is a prime greater than 3. It has an aliquot sum of 42, which is the second sphenic number. It is also: A semiperfect number, since adding some subsets of its divisors (e.g., 5, 10 and 15) equals 30. A primorial. A Harshad number in decimal. Divisible by the number of prime numbers (10) below it. The largest number such that all coprimes smaller than itself, except for 1, are prime. The sum of the first four squares, making it a square pyramidal number. The number of vertices in the Tutte–Coxeter graph. The measure of the central angle and exterior angle of a dodecagon, which is the petrie polygon of the 24-cell.

The number of edges of a dodecahedron and icosahedron, of vertices of an icosidodecahedron, and of faces of a rhombic triacontahedron. The sum of the number of elements of a 5-cell: 5 vertices, 10 edges, 10 faces, and 5 cells. The Coxeter number of E8. Furthermore, In a group G, such that |G|=pn×m{\displaystyle |G|=p^{n}\times m}, where p does not divide m, and has a subgroup of order pn{\displaystyle p^{n}}, 30 is the only number less than 60 that is neither a prime nor of the aforementioned form. Therefore, 30 is the only candidate for the order of a simple group less than 60, in which one needs other methods to specifically reject to eventually deduce said order.[citation needed] The SI prefix for 1030 is Quetta- (Q), and for 10−30 (i.e., the reciprocal of 1030) quecto (q). These numbers are the largest and smallest number to receive an SI prefix to date. Look up thirty in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. The atomic number of zinc is 30.

It was also the age when David became King (2 Samuel 5:4) and Ezekiel and John the Baptist began their own ministries, (based on Ezekiel 1:1 and John the Baptist's age in comparison to Jesus.) Age 30 is when Jewish priests traditionally start their service (according to Numbers 4:3). One of the rallying cries of the 1960s student/youth protest movement was the slogan, "Don't trust anyone over thirty".
