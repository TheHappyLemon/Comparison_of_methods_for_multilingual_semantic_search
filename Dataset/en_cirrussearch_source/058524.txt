The Duchy of Bohemia was established in 870 and raised to the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198. Several Bohemian monarchs ruled as non-hereditary kings beforehand, first gaining the title in 1085. From 1004 to 1806, Bohemia was part of the Holy Roman Empire, and its ruler was an elector. During 1526–1804 the Kingdom of Bohemia, together with the other lands of the Bohemian Crown, was ruled under a personal union as part of the Habsburg monarchy. From 1804 to 1918, Bohemia was part of the Austrian Empire, which itself was part of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary from 1867 to 1918. Following the dissolution of the monarchy, the Bohemian lands, now also referred to as Czech lands, became part of Czechoslovakia, and they have formed today's Czech Republic since 1993. praotec Čech (Pater Boemus) Lech Krok Libuše, female ruler Přemysl the Ploughman, husband of Libuše Valasca, female and contested ruler against Přemysl Nezamysl Mnata Vojen Vnislav Křesomysl Neklan Hostivít Family tree of Bohemian monarchs Category:Monarchs of Bohemia Category:Bohemian royal houses Category:Nobility from medieval Bohemia List of rulers of Czechs List of Bohemian consorts Coronation of the Bohemian monarch Bohemian crown jewels Most frequently cited year of birth; other cited years are 908 or 911. VI as duke of Carinthia. Between 1112 and 1123 Znojmo was part of Brno. According to a bold hypothesis by historian Jaroslav Zástěra, the Premyslid dynasty was a possible direct descendant of the ruling family of Great Moravia, being Borivoj a son of Rastislav of Moravia.

According to legend. See page of the duke for details. The intermission of other feudal lords of different branches could be seen as regencies, as it would happen, for example, in the 15-century Duchy of Austria, where Duke Frederick V exerted regency for his minor cousin, Ladislaus the Posthumous. However, these intermissions could be also similar, for example, to Kievan Rus', where rulers apparently "jumped" from place to place. Albeit this, nothing is proved. The note referring to the regencies could apply here as well. The reason Conrad did not receive his duchy right after his father's death could be related to a possible minority that stopped him for assuming his power sooner. The regency referred in previous notes may be proven here: in 1126, when his father died, he was too young to assume power. The rulers appointed by Sobeslaus I in the period 1126–40 could be functioning as regents.
