The Azerbaijan Grand Prix (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan Qran Prisi) is a Formula One motor racing event that was held for the first time in 2017. It is held on the Baku City Circuit, a street circuit in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. The event is due to take place at the Baku City Circuit until at least 2026. The first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in Azerbaijan was the 2016 European Grand Prix, which took place at the Baku City Circuit. A year later, in 2017, the same venue hosted the first Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The race was held on 25 June and was one of five races to be held on a street circuit during the 2017 Formula One season, along with the Singapore, Monaco, Australian and Canadian Grands Prix. The first Azerbaijan Grand Prix winner was Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull, grabbing his first win of the 2017 campaign during Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix took place on 29 April as the 4th round of the season and was won by Lewis Hamilton. The 2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix was held on 28 April as the 4th round of the season and was won by Valtteri Bottas. In March 2020, the 2020 race was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, before being cancelled later in the year. The 2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix featured as the 6th round of the season, and the race was won by Sergio Pérez. The 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix was won by Max Verstappen. The 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix became the first Grand Prix to implement a new format featuring a new qualifying session called "sprint shootout" which determined the grid for one of the six sprints in the 2023 season. Sergio Pérez became the first driver to win the Azerbaijan Grand Prix twice, following his win in 2021, securing a victory in the race and also in the sprint.
