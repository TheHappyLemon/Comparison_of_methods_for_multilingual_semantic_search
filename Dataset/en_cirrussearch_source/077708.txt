.lt is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Lithuania. Following the University of Oslo's request to the Norwegian government that a Lithuanian Internet ccTLD be established, .lt was launched on June 3 1992. Domain name registration was initially limited to the academic community, state institutions and companies, with the first second-level domains—mii.lt, ktu.lt, and vu.lt—being registered in 1993. In 1994 administration of the .lt ccTLD was transferred from Oslo University to the Kaunas University of Technology. ".lt domeno statistika". DOMREG.lt. 2022-12-17.
