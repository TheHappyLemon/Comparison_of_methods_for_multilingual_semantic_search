The Tokyo Marathon (東京マラソン, Tōkyō Marason) is an annual marathon sporting event in Tokyo, Japan. It is a World Athletics Platinum Label marathon and one of the six World Marathon Majors. The latest edition of the race took place on 3 March 2024. It is sponsored by Tokyo Metro. The first Tokyo Marathon was held on 18 February 2007. However, years prior to 2007, Tokyo Marathon consisted of two marathons: the Tokyo International Marathon which took place on even years, and Tokyo-New York Friendship International Marathon which took place on odd years. In the inaugural year, 1981, both marathons took place. However, because it was not possible to support two marathons a month apart in the same city, from 1982, the alternating format went into effect.[citation needed] The 2007 marathon was also a representative selection race of the 2007 World Championships in Athletics in Osaka. The total number of participants was set at 30,000. Of that, 25,000 people signed up for the marathon, and 5,000 signed up for the 10K run. Masakazu Fujiwara became the race's first Japanese male winner at the fourth edition. In February 2014, Dickson Chumba won in a record time of 2:05:42. This was only the second time a runner ran below 2h06 in Japan, after Tsegaye Kebede in Fukuoka Marathon (December 6, 2009). His runner-up, Tadese Tola did also run below 2:06, in a time of 2:05:57. In January 2020, rock musician Hyde released the song "Believing in Myself" as a single inspired by the event. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, only elite runners were invited to the 2020 Tokyo Marathon. All other participants were given a deferral to 2021. The 2021 Tokyo Marathon was postponed to 17 October 2021 due to the pandemic. It was then postponed again to 6 March 2022; the event was still referred to as the 2021 Tokyo Marathon, and there was no 2022 Tokyo Marathon. Additionally, all overseas runners were barred from competing, with their entries automatically transferred to 2023.
