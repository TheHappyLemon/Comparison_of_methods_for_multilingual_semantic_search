The Detroit Falcons were a Basketball Association of America (forerunner of the National Basketball Association) team based in Detroit. It played in the inaugural 1946–47 season and folded soon after the season ended, leaving Detroit without a professional basketball team until a decade later, when the Fort Wayne Pistons moved there. The Falcons played only in the inaugural season of the BAA and finished 4th in the Western Division with a 20–40 record, 18+1⁄2 games out of first place. Stan Miasek was the team's star, scoring 895 points (14.9 points per game) and making the BAA's First-Team that year. Head coaches Glenn M.
