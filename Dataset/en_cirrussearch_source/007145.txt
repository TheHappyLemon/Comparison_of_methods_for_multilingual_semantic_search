The GMG (Granatmaschinengewehr or "grenade machine gun") is an automatic grenade launcher developed by Heckler & Koch for the German Army. It is also often referred to as GMW or GraMaWa (Granatmaschinenwaffe). The GMG fires 40 mm grenades at a rate of about 340 rounds per minute. It is belt-fed, and can be loaded from either side, making it easy to mount on most platforms. With a variety of day and night sights available, the GMG can be used for most medium range infantry support situations. The weapon is 1.09 m long and has a 415 mm rifled barrel; the ammunition box has dimensions of 470 × 160 × 250 mm. The gun cycles on a recoil-operated blow-back basis. It weighs 29 kg; the tripod is an additional 11 kg. The HK GMG was tested in the Yuma desert in Arizona in 1997 in order to compete for future United States contracts.  Belgium: Mounted on the army's Jankel FOX Rapid Reaction Vehicles  Canada: 304 ordered.
