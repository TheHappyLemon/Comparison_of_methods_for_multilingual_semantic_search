The national team's first ever ice hockey match was a 10–0 loss on 19 January 2017, to Jakarta Dragons at the Bintaro Jaya Xchange Ice Skating Rink in Bintaro, Tangerang. Many of the Indonesian national team's players that partook in the match came from the Batavia Demons, a team that won the 2016 City Cup international ice hockey tournament (B Division invitational with some import player from Taiwan) which was held in Singapore. Indonesia made its debut in the international tournament at the 2017 Asian Winter Games in Sapporo, Japan. Their first tournament match was supposed to be against Iran, but their opposition was disqualified due to eligibility issues. Iran still played their scheduled match against Indonesia on 17 February 2017, resulting a 10–3 win for the former. However, the game was considered as an exhibition game and its results had no bearing in the standings of the tournament. Indonesia later lost 13–2 to Malaysia in their first Asian Winter Games.
