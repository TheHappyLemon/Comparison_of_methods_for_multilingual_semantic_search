Weißenberg was founded in 1228 at the Via Regia by Ottokar I of Bohemia and it used to be called Wizenburg, referring to the city's white castle. In 1625, the town was able to buy its freedom from its noble masters for 8,500 thalers, but Weißenberg still had to accept a knightly patron. Today's district of Wurschen is engraved on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, since the Battle of Bautzen (1813) on May 20 and 21. In the 18th century, Weißenberg was still mentioned as a largely Sorbian-inhabited market town, with all residents also speaking German. In the 1880s Arnošt Muka determined a population of 1242, including 300 Sorbs (24%). In 1893 the regular Sorbian services in the Weißenberg church were abolished. 1956, Ernst Tschernik counted a Sorbian-speaking population of only 5.8%, a total of 81 speakers. Today, the Sorbian community in Weißenberg is a big minority. On April 17, 1945, the battlefield of World War II came to Weißenberg for the first time, when Soviet artillery shelled the town's train station. The following day Weißenberg was occupied by Soviet troops. From 1952 to 1990, Weißenberg was part of the Bezirk Dresden of East Germany.
