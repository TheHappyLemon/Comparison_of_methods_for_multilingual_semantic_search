İstanbul Başakşehir Futbol Kulübü (Turkish pronunciation: [isˈtɑnbuɫ bɑʃɑkʃeˈhiɾ futˈboɫ kulyˈby]), or due to sponsorship reasons Rams Başakşehir is a Turkish professional football club based in the Başakşehir district of Istanbul. The club is better known simply as Başakşehir (Turkish pronunciation: [bɑʃɑkʃeˈhiɾ]). The club was founded in 1990 as İstanbul Büyükşehir Belediyespor (Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Sports Club). They first reached the highest level in Turkish Football in 2007–08.

The club played in the TFF Second League until 1996, but after the 2006–07 season they were promoted to the Süper Lig. Finishing 12th in the 2007–08 season enabled them to remain in the Süper Lig for the 2007–08 season. In the 2009–10 season, the club finished the season in 6th place.
