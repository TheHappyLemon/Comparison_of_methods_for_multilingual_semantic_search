Hatice Sultan (Ottoman Turkish: خدیجه سلطان; died 1538) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Selim I and Hafsa Sultan. She was the sister of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Hatice married Bostancıbaşı Iskender Pasha in 1509. He was Sultan Bayezid II's loyal servant. He later became the commander of the Ottoman fleet during Bayezid's reign. In a crucial event in 1512, while in this role, Iskender provided substantial assistance to Selim by implementing a blockade on the Bosphorus. This action effectively prevented Selim's chief rival, Prince Ahmed, from crossing from Üsküdar to Istanbul. The two together had three sons, Mehmedşah Bey, Kara Osmanşah Bey and Suleiman Bey, and a daughter Nefise Sultan. He was executed in 1515. Hatice then married Çoban Mustafa Pasha. Mustafa held a junior governor position under Bayezid's reign. His swift rise saw promotions to governor-generalships, first in Anatolia in 1516 and then immediately in Rumelia in 1517. Mustafa's political acumen and loyalty likely caught Selim's attention, leading to the honor of marrying Hatice in 1517. She died in 1538 and was buried in the courtyard of Yavuz Selim Mosque in Istanbul. After her death, her son Kara Osman commissioned a mosque and a school in her name in Aksaray. It had long been believed that Hatice was married to Grand Vizier Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha. However, in the late 2000s, research conducted by the historian Ebru Turan revealed that this claim was not based on solid evidence, and that in fact no such marriage ever took place between them. As a result, historians now agree that Ibrahim married another woman, Muhsine Hatun, and not Hatice. In the 2003 TV miniseries Hürrem Sultan, Hatice Sultan is portrayed by Turkish actress Ayten Soykök. In the 2011 TV series Muhteşem Yüzyıl, Hatice Sultan is played by Turkish-German actress Selma Ergeç. Also known as Hanım Sultan, Hanım Hatun, Sultanzade Sultan and Şahzade. Bostan, M.
