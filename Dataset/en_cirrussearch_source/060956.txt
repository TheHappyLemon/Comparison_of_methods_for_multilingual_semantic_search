Boiarka or Boyarka (Ukrainian: Боярка) is a city in Fastiv Raion of Kyiv Oblast (region) of Ukraine, about 20 km SW from Kyiv. It hosts the administration of Boiarka urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 34,394 (2022 estimate). The population in 2001 was 35,968. There are traces of an old Kyivan Rus' settlement, including the remains of an ancient cemetery. The railway reached the town in the 1860s, after which it became a favourite resort for artists and writers, including the composer Mykola Lysenko and the writer Sholom Aleichem. The fictional dacha settlement of Boyberik, where events of Aleichem's tales of Tevye the Milkman (later adapted as Fiddler on the Roof) take place, is based on Boiarka. Until 18 July 2020, Boiarka belonged to Kyiv-Sviatoshyn Raion. The raion was abolished that day as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kyiv Oblast to seven. The area of Kyiv-Sviatoshyn Raion was split between Bucha, Fastiv, and Obukhiv Raions, with Boiarka being transferred to Fastiv Raion. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian shelling struck the suburbs of Boiarka during the Battle of Kyiv. The Kyiv Oblast orphanage is located in Boiarka. The town is also the location of the Boiarka Metrological Centre, owned by the company Naftogaz, which provides calibration services for gas-flow meters. During the years 2005 to 2007, the town hosted the now-defunct football club, FC Inter Boiarka. Boiarka has a team called FC Inter Boiarka, that in 2001 was also coached by Yukhym Shkolnykov.
