He was widely cited in newspapers on February 20, 2008, following a 34-year-old English man being jailed in Riga for urinating on the historic Freedom Monument. Seglins described the British people who cause trouble in Latvia when inebriated, typically on weekends away for parties such as stag nights, as "pigs". He also said "These people think it is a tradition to defile our monument. They are pigs, those British. A piggy nation." Despite this, drunken individuals from multiple nations have urinated on the monument. In March 2009, Seglins became the minister of justice in Valdis Dombrovskis' cabinet. He stepped down in 2010, when his party left the cabinet. "Tourist jailed for urinating on statue", The Independent. Wikimedia Commons has media related to Mareks Segliņš. v t e
