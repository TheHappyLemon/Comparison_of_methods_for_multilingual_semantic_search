Raisio (Finnish: [ˈrɑi̯sio]; Swedish: Reso) is a town in Finland, located in the Southwest Finland region. It lies north of the regional capital, Turku. The population of Raisio is approximately 25,000, while the sub-region has a population of approximately 347,000. It is the 40th most populous municipality in Finland, and the third largest municipality in the Southwest Finland region after Turku ja Kaarina. The town of Raisio has a land area of 48.76 km2 (18.83 sq mi), and has about 5 kilometres (3 mi) of coastline to the Bay of Raisio at its southern tip. The coat of arms of Raisio is inspired by Martin of Tours, the patron saint of the medieval stone church of Raisio parish. The coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson and approved for use on 23 April 1954. The oldest known written record of Raisio is from 1292, and there is strong evidence of Stone Age settlement in the area, but Raisio did not become a town until 1974. It was an agricultural area until the late 20th century. The success of the Raisio Group company transformed the town into an industrial centre and triggered a huge increase in population - during the 20th century the population of Raisio increased elevenfold. The town's existence was threatened by Turku city's plans to merge with Raisio. This changed after the Raisio Group became a successful company. The name Raisio was originally given to the river Raisionjoki. The earliest form of the river's name is Raisajoki, which means "marsh/bog river", and etymological evidence for this can be found in the Estonian word raisnik, which means "mire". Another theory about the etymology of the name Raisio is that it comes from the word raiskio, meaning a forest damaged by poor forest management, as the Raisio landscape was altered by siltation and post-glacial uplift after the Ice Age.
