The 1961–62 European Cup was the seventh season of the European Cup. The competition was won by Benfica for the second time in a row, beating Real Madrid 5–3 in the final at the Olympisch Stadion in Amsterdam. Malta entered its champion for the first time this season. The draw for the preliminary round took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 4 July 1961. As title holders, Benfica received a bye, and the remaining 28 teams were grouped geographically into two pots. The first team drawn in each pot also received a bye, while the remaining clubs would play the first round in September. The calendar was decided by the involved teams, with all matches to be played by 30 September. 1 The second leg was scratched and Vorwärts Berlin were advanced to the first round as Linfield were unable to arrange an alternate venue after UK immigration officials refused to issue the Vorwärts team visas to enter the country. 23 August 1961 Städtisches Stadium, Nuremberg Attendance: 30,645 Referee: Pieter Paulus Roomer (Netherlands) 30 August 1961 Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, Berlin Attendance: 15,626 Referee: Johan Einar Boström (Sweden) 5 September 1961 Stade Louis II, Monaco Attendance: 6,024 Referee: Daniel María Zariquiegui Izco (Spain) 6 September 1961 Vasil Levski National Stadium, Sofia Attendance: 23,000 Referee: Bronisław Bilak (Poland) 6 September 1961 Nya Ullevi, Gothenburg Attendance: 5,431 Referee: Einar Poulsen (Denmark) 6 September 1961 Charmilles Stadium, Geneva Attendance: 14,739 Referee: Cesare Jonni (Italy) 6 September 1961 Stade Maurice Dufrasne, Liège Attendance: 23,546 Referee: Reginald Leafe (England) 6 September 1961 Népstadion, Budapest Attendance: 85,000 Referee: Marcel Bois (France) 7 September 1961 Stade Municipal, Luxembourg City Attendance: 3,000 Referee: Günther Ternieden (West Germany) 13 September 1961 Silesian Stadium, Chorzów Attendance: 55,000 Referee: Arthur Blavier (Belgium) 13 September 1961 Estádio José Alvalade, Lisbon Attendance: 16,302 Referee: Josef Gulde (Switzerland) 20 September 1961 Leoforos Alexandras Stadium, Athens Attendance: 23,904 Referee: Karol Galba (Czechoslovakia) 21 September 1961 Stadionul 23.
