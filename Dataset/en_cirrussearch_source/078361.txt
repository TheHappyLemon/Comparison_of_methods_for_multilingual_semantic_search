Women's Basketball Club Sparta&K is a professional women's basketball team based in Vidnoye, Russia that plays in FIBA’s EuroLeague Women. It won the 2005–06 EuroCup Women and the 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10 EuroLeague Women championship and two SuperCup Women. It is currently the only team that has won 4 consecutive EuroLeague Women titles since 1991 when European Cup For Women's Champions Clubs was rebranded as the Euroleague Women.[citation needed] This is due in part to the team's supplementing of its otherwise Russian roster with seasoned WNBA American and other stars Lauren Jackson, Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Tamika Catchings, Anete Jēkabsone-Žogota, and others. In 2010, the club was renamed to Sparta&K after the sports society Spartak were against the usage of the brand "Spartak" in December 2009. The last letter is devoted to murdered basketball sponsor Shabtai Kalmanovich.
