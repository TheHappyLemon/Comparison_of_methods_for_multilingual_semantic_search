Acetohexamide (trade name Dymelor) is a first-generation sulfonylurea medication used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly in people whose diabetes cannot be controlled by diet alone. Acetohexamide bind to an ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel on the cell membrane of pancreatic beta cells. This inhibits the out flux of potassium, which causes the membrane potential to become more positive. This depolarization in turn opens voltage-gated calcium channels. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to increased fusion of insulin granulae with the cell membrane, and therefore increased secretion of insulin. Oral hypoglycemic drugs, including acetohexamide, have been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Qualified healthcare professionals should consulted for possible risks, benefits, and alternatives of using this drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Montgomery DA (October 1964).
