Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition is a 2005 racing video game developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games. It is the third installment in the Midnight Club series. Like previous installments in the series, the game is an arcade-style racer and focuses on wild, high-speed racing, rather than realistic physics and driving. The name is derived from a partnership between Rockstar and DUB Magazine, which features heavily in the game in the form of DUB-sponsored races and DUB-customized vehicles as prizes. Players race through open world recreations of San Diego, Atlanta, and Detroit listening to 98 (124 in the Remix version) licensed music tracks that include hip hop, rock, and other genres. The game features a number of graphical views after the player crashes into certain objects, or travels across particular stretches of road. There is also the ability to customize a player's vehicle. Other than modifying the external looks, the vehicle's performance can also be improved (with the exception of all "A" Class non-motorcycle vehicles). Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition is the first game in the series to feature licensed vehicles. Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition is an open world racing video game and the first game in the series to include car modification, both visual and performance. By winning races, the player unlocks new cars and options to customize them with. These options include enhancing the performance, adding vinyls and new paint jobs, and physically modifying the car by changing parts such as wheels, bumpers, spoilers, neon, hoods, and engine components. The cars are divided into four classes: D, C, B and A, depending on their performance. There are five types of races in the game: Ordered Race, Circuit Race, Unordered Race, Autocross Race, Track and Frenzy. In ordered races the player races through the city on a course marked by yellow-orange flares to reach a finish line. In circuit races the player races along a circuit course through the city for a set number of laps. In unordered races the player is free to go through scattered checkpoints in any order before crossing the finish line. Autocross races take place in a walled-in circuit of the street with no traffic or police, the goal being to finish the circuit faster than a set time. Track events, available in arcade mode, are similar to autocross races, except that the player competes against other races inside the barricaded track, often taking more damage. Frenzy events also available in Arcade, are time trial races where the player gets every 15 second a nitrous boost, also the handbrake won't work and the race only ends when the time is over. Players can also create their own races in the Race Editor (not available in the PSP version). Players can create either a circuit, ordered or unordered race by placing checkpoints throughout the city, and can change racing conditions such as traffic, weather, and time of day. There are seven types of cars: Tuners, Luxury Sedans, SUVs/Trucks, Exotics, Muscle Cars, Sport Bikes, and Choppers. As the game continues, different clubs that drive a specific type of car will invite the player to race with them: American Royalty Car Club (Muscle Cars), Big Playas (SUVs/Trucks), By Invitation Only (Exotics), Chopper of America Bike Club (Choppers), Luxury Rollers (Luxury Cars), Original Riders (Sport Bikes) and Unbeatable Street Racers (Tuners). If the player beats a club in three races they unlock a special ability for that class. Tuners, Sport Bikes, Exotics, the Lexus SC430 and Mercedes Benz SL 500 (R230) (along with its higher-performance AMG variant, the SL 55) get "Zone" (a form of bullet time which allows for more precise handling at high speeds), Trucks/SUVs and Luxury Cars get "Agro" (which allows the vehicle to plow through traffic and other obstacles without taking damage or slowing down), and Muscle Cars and Choppers get "Roar" (the only offensive ability, it launches a sonic wave that blows away any vehicles in its path). The game includes an online mode, where players can race with other players from all around the world. There are also many clubs available to join, but players can also start and manage their own. Most offline modes are available for play online, while in online mode it is possible to chat in-game, including a cruise mode, capture the flag, circuit racing, ordered racing, unordered racing, tag, paint and Autocross. Tracks created via the Race Editor offline can be used Online. On Xbox Live, the game also supports voice chat. The player begins in San Diego by meeting Oscar (David Barrera), the mechanic of Six-One-Nine Customs, a tuning garage in San Diego. Oscar guides the player through the game by providing helpful tips and information about races. The player begins with a choice of six cars: a 1964 Chevrolet Impala, a 1978 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, a 2004 Dodge Neon SRT-4, a 2004 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT-S, a Volkswagen Golf R32 Mk4, or a 2004 Volkswagen Jetta (Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition Remix added the option of a Scion tC). As the player wins races new customization options and cars are unlocked for purchase. The street racers available to challenge at the beginning of the game are: Vanessa (Mitsubishi Eclipse GT-S), Bishop (Lexus GS430), and Carlos (1978 Chevrolet Monte Carlo). Beating each of these street racers will unlock an invitation to challenge a racing club the rival racer is part of; Vanessa unlocks the Unbeatable Street Racers (Tuners; which rewards the player with a Nissan Skyline GT-R (R34)), Bishop unlocks the Luxury Rollers (Luxury Sedans; which rewards the player with a Mercedes-Benz CL 55 AMG (C215)) and Carlos unlocks the American Royalty Car Club (Muscle Cars; which rewards the player with a Chevrolet Corvette (C3)) Beating two of these street racers will allow the player to challenge Phil for ownership of his Hotmatch Cuevito, and an invitation to challenge the Chopper of America bike club. Once the player defeats Phil, Vanessa will challenge them again, this time, driving an upgraded Mitsubishi Eclipse GT-S. After defeating all racers and tournaments in San Diego, the player is introduced to Vince (Kiff VandenHeuvel), a mechanic from Detroit. Oscar mentions that the player has been building a reputation as a skilled racer, and that there are some big time races in Atlanta that the player may be interested in. He tells the player to go to the shipping company to make the trip. The player arrives at a garage in Atlanta called "Apone Team Racing". The owner, Apone (Dexter Tillis), introduces himself, but is distracted by his most prized possession: a 1964 gold painted Chevrolet Impala that he customized and is constantly tinkering with. In Atlanta, the player is challenged by three racers. There is also a tournament going on, for which the prize is a "DUB'd-Out" 2004 Cadillac Escalade EXT. After defeating all racers and tournaments in Atlanta, Apone mentions that there are more races going on in Detroit and that he thinks it is a good idea for the player to check it out. Street racers in Atlanta are: Roy (1969 Dodge Charger R/T, later a 1999 Dodge Charger R/T Concept), Dre (2005 Cadillac Escalade (second generation)), Cheng (Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII), Vito (Ducati Monster S4R), Lamont (Chevrolet Silverado SS; later returns in a Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR Strassenversion during the US Championship) and Naomi (Hotmatch Skully). Defeating Vito unlocks the Original Riders (Sport Bikes), defeating Dre or Lamont unlocks the Big Playas (SUV/Trucks). The player arrives in Detroit and sees a familiar face, Vince. Remembering him, he welcomes the player to town and his shop. He later points to a Lamborghini Murci√©lago and says it is the prize to whatever car club turns out the best street racer. A familiar face from Atlanta comes to Detroit, Roy, who is a plot-affected racer but is never seen or mentioned. The player races them a couple of times, as well as the car clubs. Early in the player's Detroit career, a tournament is held and a 1949 Chevrolet Fleetline (as Oscar describes it "Just the car to win in Detroit!") is the prize. Upon defeating Ceasar in his first encounter, the player scores a challenge from the By Invitation Only Exotic Car Club. Defeating them earns the player a special, rare 2004 Chrysler ME Four-Twelve (with "Zone" for Exotics being unlocked after the third race). After defeating all racers in Detroit, the player races certain drivers twice in a series titled U.S. Championship Series, which takes place in all three cities. and upon defeating them, is crowned the victor of the U.S. Champion Series. Afterwards, the player returns to Vince's and is rewarded the Lamborghini Murcielago from before. Vince says: "It should be driven with respect, and not by some San Diego swinger who thinks he's hot stuff or something". Street racers in Detroit are: Roy (returning with a Dodge Viper GTS-R Concept; and eventually with a McLaren F1 LM), Spider (Hotmatch D'Elegance), Leo (1981 Chevrolet Camaro Z28), Ceasar (Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, later a Lamborghini Gallardo and eventually a Chrysler ME Four-Twelve), Kioshi (Aprilla RSV 1000 R Mille Factory, later a Kawasaki Ninja ZX-12R), and Angel (Saleen S7; later a Cadillac Cien). According to the developer Rockstar San Diego, the three cities present in the initial 2005 release of the game were chosen due to their significance to the game's automotive and racing themes. Atlanta was chosen for its pioneering of automobile customization, Detroit due to its status as the birthplace of the U.S. automobile industry, and San Diego for its influence on the development of street racing culture. Rockstar Games also developed a Remix version of the game, which was released in March 2006. Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition Remix is a revised edition of Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition. It is available as a Greatest Hits release on PlayStation 2 and a Platinum Hits release on Xbox (the remix edition of the game is not available for the PlayStation Portable).
