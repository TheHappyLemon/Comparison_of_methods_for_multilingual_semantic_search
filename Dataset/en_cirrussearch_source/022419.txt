Jupiter LVI, provisionally known as S/2011 J 2, is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by Scott Sheppard in 2011. Images of the newly discovered moon were captured using the Magellan-Baade telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. It is an irregular moon with a retrograde orbit. The discovery of Jupiter LVI brought the Jovian satellite count to 67. It is one of the outer retrograde swarm of objects orbiting Jupiter and belongs to the Pasiphae group. The moon was lost following its discovery in 2011. It was recovered in 2017 and given its permanent designation that year. S.S.

We likely have all of the lost moons in our new observations from 2017, but to link them back to the remaining lost 2003 objects requires more observations a year later to confirm the linkages, which will not happen until early 2018. ... There are likely a few more new moons as well in our 2017 observations, but we need to reobserve them in 2018 to determine which of the discoveries are new and which are lost 2003 moons.
