The county's coat of arms can be blazoned as follows: Gules, an aurochs head caboshed argent ensigned by a cross Or between his horns enclosed by a bordure purpure charged with ten evenly distributed crosses of Lorraine Or. The flag's heraldic blazon is identical, since the flag is a banner of the arms.
