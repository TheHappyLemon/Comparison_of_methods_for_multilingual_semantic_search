Jason David Frank (September 4, 1973 – November 19, 2022) was an American actor, model and mixed martial artist best known for his role as Tommy Oliver in the Power Rangers television franchise. Frank was born in Covina, California on September 4, 1973. Frank had an older brother named Erik Frank, who appeared in Power Rangers Zeo as Tommy Oliver's long-lost brother David Trueheart. Modeling life Frank Was Modeling In The Production industry Called Olive Productions During 1980s At The Young Age Power Rangers Frank was cast in the role of Tommy Oliver, the Green Ranger in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The role was set for 14 episodes, but due to the character's popularity he was brought back as the White Ranger and the team's new leader. Frank was supposed to be the lead character Adam Steele in VR Troopers (originally called Cybertron) and shot a pilot episode before being called back to Power Rangers. According to Frank and Brad Hawkins, Hawkins' character was originally going to replace Tommy Oliver as the White Ranger in Power Rangers. However, due to Tommy Oliver's popularity with Power Rangers fans, Frank was brought back, with Tommy Oliver becoming the White Ranger. Hawkins would then take over the role of Ryan Steele on VR Troopers, who was originally named Adam Steele. After three seasons, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers transitioned into Power Rangers Zeo to match the annual change of the Super Sentai series. Frank's character became the Red Zeo Ranger, also called Zeo Ranger V. The following year in Power Rangers Turbo, his character became the first Red Turbo Ranger. During mid-season, Frank and his fellow cast members Johnny Yong Bosch, Nakia Burrise and Catherine Sutherland agreed to leave and were replaced. After leaving the series in 1997, in 2002 Frank returned to Power Rangers as the Red Zeo Ranger for the special 10th-anniversary episode, entitled "Forever Red", of Power Rangers Wild Force. This episode brought back ten former Red Rangers and reunited him with Austin St. John. He then reprised his role in 2004 in Power Rangers Dino Thunder as the Black Dino Ranger, which he stated was a favor to Douglas Sloan. While portraying this role, Frank wore long-sleeved shirts to cover the tattoos on his arms, which was also the case in "Forever Red". He joked that Saban and Disney are "both the same, they're cheap", but that he was impressed with the production crew for Dino Thunder. Frank reprised his role as Tommy Oliver and the Green Ranger in the season finale of Power Rangers Super Megaforce. Frank expressed interest in developing a Green Ranger solo series or feature film after an encounter with Stan Lee at a comic book convention. Frank had a cameo role in the 2017 film Power Rangers, as a citizen of Angel Grove, alongside fellow Power Rangers actress Amy Jo Johnson. In 2018, he reprised his role as Tommy in episode 10 of Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel for the 25th anniversary of Power Rangers. In August 2022, Frank revealed that he had retired from the franchise.[citation needed] On November 7, 2013, Frank appeared on Super Power Beatdown as the White Ranger taking on Scorpion from Mortal Kombat. He appeared again on May 5, 2015, as the Green Ranger, and fought Ryu from Street Fighter. After success with the Super Power Beatdown series, Bat in the Sun began developing a web reality series of Frank, titled My Morphing Life. In 2015, the show began airing a second season. In 2016, Frank was cast in the web series Ninjak vs. the Valiant Universe, based on the Valiant Universe, as Bloodshot. The series was released in 2018 to positive reception from fans. Frank was considered as superior to Vin Diesel's incarnation of the character in 2020.[citation needed] Valiant paid tribute to Frank on their Twitter after his death. The film Legend of the White Dragon launched on Kickstarter in 2020. Initially, it was going to be a mini-series or fan film, but its popularity caused it to develop into a full-feature film. The film includes past Power Rangers performers, such as Frank, Jason Faunt, and Ciara Hanna. Other cast members include Mark Dacascos, Michael Madsen, Andrew Byron Bachelor, and Jenna Frank. The movie wrapped in 2021, and is currently in post-production. It was set to release in March 2023, but after Frank's death in 2022, the film is now scheduled to be released in Q1, 2024. Frank had knowledge of many different styles of martial arts, including Shōtōkan, Wadō-ryū, Taekwondo, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, Jeet Kune Do, and Aikido. He modified the most practical applications with his own philosophies to create his own blend of American Karate in 1994, "Toso Kune Do" (斗争拳道, lit. 'Way of the Fist-Fighter' or 'Way of the Fighting Fist').[unreliable source?] On June 28, 2003, he was inducted into the World Karate Union Hall of Fame. Frank appeared at the Arnold Classic on February 29, 2008, in Columbus, Ohio.[citation needed] "Toso Kune Do" is still taught at his "Rising Sun Karate" dojo in Houston, Tx Frank was temporarily a Guinness World Record holder in January 2013, as he successfully broke the existing record for the most 1 inch pine boards broken during freefall. The previous record was only two boards broken, but Frank attempted to break eight and successfully broke seven in his record breaking attempt. His record was eclipsed only a few months later in May 2013 by current Guinness World Record holder Ernie Torres, who broke twelve boards during his attempt. On August 21, 2009, Frank officially announced his signing with SuckerPunch Entertainment,[unreliable source?] a sports marketing and management company specializing in MMA. He began training with UFC lightweight Melvin Guillard. Frank made his much-anticipated MMA debut for the United States Amateur Combat Association at the company's first event "Lonestar Beatdown: Houston" on January 30, 2010, at the Houston Arena Theatre. He defeated Jonathon "the Mack Truck" Mack in the first round by omoplata submission.[unreliable source?] Frank fought in his second fight at Lonestar Beatdown: Dallas on February 19 in Arlington, Texas. His opponent was Chris Rose, who made his ring entrance wearing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles robe. Frank defeated Rose in round 1 with a TKO. On May 8, 2010, he fought for the Texas Rage in the Cage Amateur Association "Cage Rage 7" in State Farm Arena in Hidalgo, Texas. His opponent was James Willis, who he defeated via KO with a rising knee within 23 seconds of the first round starting. Frank was scheduled to make his debut with Ultimate Warrior Challenge at their upcoming event on May 22 against James "Ray" Handy Jr. in a light heavyweight bout. On May 21, Frank announced on his official Facebook fan page that James Handy was injured and Carlos Horn would replace him, changing the fight to a heavyweight bout. Frank defeated Horn in the first round by an armbar submission. Since turning pro, Frank expressed interest in signing a deal with Strikeforce and potentially fighting Herschel Walker. Frank announced on his Facebook fan page that he was scheduled to make his professional debut on August 4, 2010, in Houston at "Puro Combate #1." He fought at heavyweight, with his opponent being Jose Roberto Vasquez. Frank won his pro MMA debut with a time of 0:46 in the first round by a Rear Naked Choke Submission. Frank was scheduled for a light heavyweight bout on December 9, 2010, at Puro Combate 3. The fight was canceled on December 8, due to his opponent not being medically cleared. He was then scheduled to face Shawn Machado on July 22, 2011, at Legacy FC 7, but due to a possible biceps tear, the fight was cancelled. On January 17, 2023, the first footage of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once & Always was released on YouTube, showing the original Green Ranger. This prompted speculation that Frank was reprising the role again, and that his denials on social media were part of a disinformation campaign. On March 6, the YouTube channel MrWeenieProductions posted audio recorded from a livestream from the Bat in the Sun channel, run by a friend of Frank's. This friend had stated that Frank declined to participate in the reunion due to an alleged history of lies, broken promises, and uncredited idea theft by Hasbro and Saban. Frank began attending a Christian church after the death of his brother Erik. He married his first wife, Shawna, in 1994, and they had three children together before divorcing in 2001. In 2003, he married his second wife, Tammie, and they had one daughter. In 2022, Tammie filed for divorce, though she and Frank were attempting to reconcile. In 2017, he was targeted by a man named Matthew Sterling while attending Phoenix Comicon. Police were able to arrest Sterling before he got near Frank, after being tipped off due to social media threats made by Sterling. Sterling was later committed to 25+1⁄2 years at the Arizona State Hospital. On November 19, 2022, Frank was found dead by suicide in a hotel in Houston, Texas. His wife Tammie, who was also staying at the hotel, subsequently explained that Frank had been struggling with depression and other mental-health issues. Several of Frank's former co-stars—including Amy Jo Johnson, Austin St. John, David Yost, Walter Emanuel Jones and Steve Cardenas—posted tributes to Frank. Lindsey, Craig D. (December 22, 2022).
