Trimagnesium phosphate describes inorganic compounds with formula Mg3(PO4)2.xH2O. They are magnesium acid salts of phosphoric acid, with varying amounts of water of crystallization: x = 0, 5, 8, 22. The octahydrate forms upon reaction of stoichiometric quantities of monomagnesium phosphate (tetrahydrate) with magnesium hydroxide. Mg(H2PO4)2•4H2O + 2 Mg(OH)2 → Mg3(PO4)2•8H2O The octahydrate is found in nature as the mineral bobierrite. The anhydrous compound is obtained by heating the hydrates to 400 °C. It is isostructural with cobalt(II) phosphate. The metal ions occupy both octahedral (six-coordinate) and pentacoordinate sites in a 1:2 ratio. Magnesium phosphate tribasic is listed on the FDA's generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, list of substances. Magnesium phosphate John Rumble (June 18, 2018).
