Kevin Volland (born 30 July 1992) is a German professional footballer who plays as a striker or a winger for Bundesliga club Union Berlin and the Germany national team. Volland gained prominence at the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship where he was awarded the Silver Boot. After starting his football career with FC Thalhofen, Volland transferred to FC Memmingen's C-Youth squad, playing in the Bavarian League, the top amateur division at that time. After relegation in 2006, he moved on to TSG Thannhausen, in order to remain in the higher division. During the summer of 2007, he joined 1860 Munich's youth academy, where he also lived on the club's grounds. During the 2009–10 season, he started 23 matches for 1860 München's U19 team, scoring seven goals. Twice that season he made the bench for the U23 squad competing in the Regionalliga Süd, although he was an unused substitute. At the start of the 2010–11 season, 1860 coach Reiner Maurer promoted him along with other A-Youth level players Moritz Leitner, Daniel Hofstetter, and Markus Ziereis to the professional squad of TSV 1860. Volland went on to feature in 12 of 1860's first 14 matches. On 14 August 2010, he made his competitive debut for 1860 alongside Moritz Leitner, when he came off the bench in the cup match in Verl. Afterwards he played two more matches for the U-19s and three more matches for the Regionalliga squad, scoring four goals for the former and two for the latter. He played his first match for the senior team in the 2. Bundesliga on 26 September 2010, coming off the bench against FC Augsburg. By the start of the winter break, he had featured in a further six matches. In January 2011, Volland signed a contract with Bundesliga side TSG 1899 Hoffenheim through 2015, but initially remained in Munich. The agreement ran through the summer of 2012, with Hoffenheim having the option to bring him in during the winter transfer period of 2011–12. While playing in Osnabrück on 21 January 2011, he scored his first competitive goal for 1860's 2. Bundesliga squad. Volland found himself in the starting line-up for the remaining fifteen matches of the season. He scored a further five goals in those matches and assisted on four more. After the end of the second division season, he rejoined the 1860 U19s who had qualified for the semi-final of the German U19 Championship. He started in both matches against 1. FC Kaiserslautern, although 1860 would fail to reach the final. At the start of the next season, Volland once again featured as a regular player for 1860, playing in the team's first six matches while scoring four goals and assisting on two more. 1899 Hoffenheim elected not to take the option to bring in Volland during the winter break, allowing him more time to mature in the 2. Bundesliga. Up to the winter break, Volland was one of the most prolific 1860 players, featuring in 21 official matches, while scoring ten goals and assisting on six more. At the end of the second division season, Volland topped the 1860 scoring charts, beating out strike partner Benjamin Lauth and winger Stefan Aigner, who both finished with eleven goals each. Overall Volland scored 20 goals in 57 league matches for 1860, while contributing a further goal in three cup matches. At the start of the 2012–13 season, Volland finally joined the Kraichgau outfit a year and a half after originally signing.

During the 2013–14 season, Volland improved his scoring total, registering nine goals and contributing a further eight assists. As a reward for his strong start with the club, Hoffenheim extended his contract on 28 July 2013, through 2017. On 22 August 2015, Volland equalled the record for the fastest goal in Bundesliga history with a ninth second opener in a 2–1 loss to champions Bayern Munich.
