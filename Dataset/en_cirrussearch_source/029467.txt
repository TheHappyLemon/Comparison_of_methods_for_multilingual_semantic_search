The largest Moravian pond, Novoveský, is located near Nová Ves just across the municipal border. The first written mention of Pohořelice is from 1222. It was a royal town until 1512, when it was acquired by Vilém II of Pernštejn. He and his descendants focused on the economic development of the town and they began to establish ponds. Pohořelice became a centre of grain growing, viticulture and fish farming. In the 18th century, the Pohořelice estate was owned by the Dietrichstein family. The town experienced construction development, especially thanks to the construction of the road from Brno to Vienna in 1727. After World War II, there was an internment camp in the town for ethnic Germans, as a part of the Brno death march. Viticulture has a long tradition here.
