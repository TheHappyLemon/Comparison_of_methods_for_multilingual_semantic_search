Kruševac (Serbian Cyrillic: Крушевац, pronounced [krûʃeʋats] ) is a city and the administrative center of the Rasina District in central Serbia. It is located in the valley of West Morava, on Rasina river. According to the 2022 census, the city administrative area has a population of 113,582 while the urban area has 68,119 inhabitants. The city was founded in 1371, by Prince Lazar of Serbia (1371–1389), who used it as his seat. The etymology is derived from the Serbian word for "river stone", krušac which was largely used for a building at that time. Kruševac was founded in 1371, as a fortified town in the possession of Lord Lazar Hrebeljanović. The Lazarica Church (or Church of St, Stephen) was built by Lazar between 1375–78, in the Morava architectural style. It is mentioned in one of Lazar's edicts in 1387, as his seat, when he affirmed the rights of Venetian merchants on Serbian territory. In preparation for the Battle of Kosovo (1389) against the Ottoman Empire, the Serbian army assembled in the city. The site of Lazar's palace is marked by a ruined enclosure containing a fragment of the tower of his spouse Princess Milica, and, according to legend, tidings of the defeat were brought to her by crows from the battlefield. After the battle, the city was held by Princess Milica as her seat. The little that remains of Lazar's city is the Kruševac Fortress, which was declared a Cultural Monument of Exceptional Importance in 1979. Several old Ottoman houses were left at the beginning of the 20th century, besides an old Turkish fountain and bath, which was known as Alacahisar (Aladža Hisar) during Ottoman rule between 1427–1833 (nominally to 1867) when Kruševac was the seat of the Sanjak of Kruševac. The Ottoman rule was interrupted during Austrian occupations between 1688–1690 and 1717–1739.[citation needed] A large monument dedicated to Serbs fallen at the Battle of Kosovo was sculpted by Đorđe Jovanović and unveiled by King Petar I Karađorđević of Serbia in 1904. A detail on the monument, among others, is a statue of the famous blind Serbian poet Filip Višnjić. At the beginning of the German occupation of Yugoslavia the units of Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland commanded by Dragutin Keserović and supported by one detachment of communists attacked the German garrison in September 1941 but failed to liberate the town after four days battle. During World War II mass executions of patriots and antifascists occurred on hill Bagdala. Largest execution was in summer of 1943. At place of executions now is a monument named Slobodište (from the Serbian word "sloboda", which means 'freedom'). Kruševac was liberated on 14 October when chetnik collaborators and Germans left the city together. After the regime of communists in Serbia ended the Government of Serbia and its Ministry of Justice established the commission to research atrocities that were committed by members of the Yugoslav Partisan Movement after they gained control over Serbia in Autumn 1944. According to the report of this commission, out of 55,554 registered victims of communist purges in Serbia the new communist regime in Kruševac killed 493 people while 11 people are missing. Kruševac progressed profusely during the SFRY. A large number of factories were built in that era, while Kruševac became one of the strongest industrial centres in both Serbia and Yugoslavia. The machine factory IMK 14. oktobar Kruševac employed around 7,000 workers. However, the large Kruševac industry hasn't survived the post-Milošević transition. In 2002 alone 5 factories went bankrupt.[unreliable source?] From 2002 to 2014 27 factories closed and around 11,000 workers lost their jobs. The unemployment rate in Kruševac was almost 39% in 2015.[unreliable source] Aside from the urban area of Kruševac, the city administrative area includes the following 100 settlements: Bošnjanе Begovo Brdo Bela Voda Belasica Bivolje Bovan Bojince Boljevac Brajkovac Bukovica Buci Velika Kruševica Velika Lomnica Veliki Kupci Veliki Šiljegovac Veliko Golovode Veliko Krušince Vitanovac Vratare Vučak Gavez Gaglovo Gari Globare Globoder Gornji Stepoš Grevci Grkljane Dvorane Dedina Dobromir Doljane Donji Stepoš Đunis Žabare Zdravinje Zebica Zubovac Jablanica Jasika Jošje Kamenare Kaonik Kapidžija Kobilje Komorane Konjuh Koševi Krvavica Kukljin Lazarevac Lazarica Lipovac Lovci Lukavac Ljubava Majdevo Makrešane Mala Vrbnica Mala Reka Mali Kupci Mali Šiljegovac Malo Golovode Malo Krušince Mačkovac Meševo Modrica Mudrakovac Naupare Padež Pakašnica Parunovac Pasjak Pepeljevac Petina Pozlata Poljaci Ribare Ribarska Banja Rlica Rosica Sebečevac Sezemče Slatina Srndalje Srnje Stanci Suvaja Sušica Tekija Trebotin Trmčare Ćelije Cerova Crkvina Čitluk Šavrane Šanac Šašilovac Šogolj Štitare According to the 2022 census results, the city of Kruševac has a total population of 113,582 inhabitants.
