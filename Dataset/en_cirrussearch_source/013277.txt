The Tour of Beijing was an annual professional stage bicycle road race held in Beijing, China. Its first edition took place in October 2011, as the penultimate event in the 2011 UCI World Tour. The tour was a partnership between the UCI and the Beijing City Government and covered a period of four years from 2011 to 2014. The event was a legacy of the 2008 Olympic Games and promoted Beijing as a global event city, whilst also promoting the environmental and healthy living outcomes cycling represent. In September 2014 the UCI announced that the 2014 edition of the race would be the last. "Tour of Beijing". FirstCycling.com. 2023. "Tour of Beijing joins 2011 World Tour calendar".
