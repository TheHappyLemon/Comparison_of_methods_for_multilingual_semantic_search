The 1981–82 season of the European Cup football club tournament was won for the only time by Aston Villa in the final against Bayern Munich. It was the sixth consecutive year that an English club won the competition. Liverpool, the defending champions, were eliminated by CSKA Sofia in the quarter-finals. The final is remembered mainly for the performance of young stand-in goalkeeper Nigel Spink who made a host of saves from the experienced Bayern players. Villa's winning goal came from Peter Withe who converted Tony Morley's cross in off the post. 26 August 1981 Stade Geoffroy Guichard, Saint-Étienne Attendance: 12,072 Referee: Clive White (England) 1 September 1981 Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion, East Berlin Attendance: 25,000 Referee: Erik Fredriksson (Sweden) BFC Dynamo won 3–1 on aggregate 16 September 1981 Praterstadion, Vienna Attendance: 27,000 Referee: Klaus Peschel (East Germany) 16 September 1981 19:00 Republican Stadium, Kyiv Attendance: 60,000 Referee: Horst Brummeier (Austria) 16 September 1981 Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion, East Berlin Attendance: 28,000 Referee: Enzo Barbaresco (Italy) 16 September 1981 Villa Park, Birmingham Attendance: 20,481 Referee: Daniel Lambert (France) 16 September 1981 Stadion Miejski, Łódź Attendance: 28,000 Referee: Henning Lund-Sørensen (Denmark) 16 September 1981 Celtic Park, Glasgow Attendance: 61,017 Referee: Charles Corver (Netherlands) 16 September 1981 Üllői út, Budapest Attendance: 28,000 Referee: Walter Eschweiler (West Germany) 16 September 1981 Empire Stadium, Gżira Attendance: 5,000 Referee: Oliver Donnelly (Northern Ireland) 16 September 1981 Kristiansand Stadion, Kristiansand Attendance: 6,149 Referee: Juhani Smolander (Finland) 16 September 1981 Raatin Stadion, Oulu Attendance: 8,400 Referee: Wiesław Bartosik (Poland) 16 September 1981 Vasil Levski National Stadium, Sofia Attendance: 10,000 Referee: Bruno Galler (Switzerland) 16 September 1981 Stade Jos Haupert, Niederkorn Attendance: 800 Referee: Francis Rion (Belgium) 16 September 1981 Idrætsparken, Copenhague Attendance: 3,200 Referee: Reidar Bjørnestad (Norway) 16 September 1981 Stadionul Central, Craiova Attendance: 26,000 Referee: Marcel Bacou (France) 16 September 1981 Estádio da Luz, Lisbon Attendance: 27,500 Referee: Anthony Mangion (Malta) 16 September 1981 Värendsvallen, Växjö Attendance: 20,100 Referee: Clive Thomas (Wales) 30 September 1981 Stadiumi Kombëtar Qemal Stafa, Tirana Attendance: 19,000 Referee: Erkan Göksel (Turkey) Austria Wien won 3–2 on aggregate. 30 September 1981 15:00 Hüseyin Avni Aker Stadyumu, Trabzon Attendance: 25,000 Referee: Bogdan Dochev (Bulgaria) Dynamo Kyiv won 2–1 on aggregate. 30 September 1981 Letzigrund, Zürich Attendance: 7,800 Referee: César Correia (Portugal) 3–3 on aggregate;
