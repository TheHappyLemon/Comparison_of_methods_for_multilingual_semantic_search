He would then go back to his boyhood club FC Tokyo in September 2021. During his club career, he won a J.League Cup in 2009 (with Tokyo), a Coppa Italia in 2011 (with Inter Milan), two back-to-back Turkish titles in 2018 and 2019, both a Turkish Cup and a Turkish Super Cup in 2019 (all with Galatasaray).
