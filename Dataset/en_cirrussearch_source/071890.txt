She attended Brearley School and the Professional Children's School. Daddario said she decided to be an actress at the age of 11. "I always loved storytelling," she stated in 2019. "It was just something I genuinely wanted to do – and I could've done anything, really. I did have every opportunity on the planet." She attended Marymount Manhattan College before dropping out to pursue acting full-time. She has spent years studying the Meisner acting technique. Daddario made her television debut at the age of 15, when she played victimized girl Laurie Lewis in the ABC daytime soap opera All My Children.

She appeared in a four-episode arc as Lisa Tragnetti, a court reporter having an extramarital affair with one of the main characters; her nude scene with Woody Harrelson attracted much attention. The following year, she had a lead role as Blake Gaines in the disaster film San Andreas and made a cameo appearance in the pilot of the Fox comedy series The Last Man on Earth. That same year, she made a guest appearance on American Horror Story: Hotel, portraying a fictionalized version of designer Natacha Rambova.
