Poland Ekstraklasa (Polish pronunciation: [ˌɛkstraˈklasa]), meaning "Extra Class" in Polish, named PKO Bank Polski Ekstraklasa since the 2019–20 season due to its sponsorship by PKO Bank Polski, is the top Polish professional league for men's association football teams. Contested by 18 clubs, operating a system of promotion and relegation with the I liga, seasons start in July, and end in May or June the following year. Teams play a total of 34 games each. Games are played on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays. The winner of the Ekstraklasa qualifies for the Polish SuperCup. The league is from 2005 on operated by the Ekstraklasa Spółka Akcyjna. The Ekstraklasa (former I liga) was officially formed as Liga Polska on 4–5 December 1926 in Warsaw, since 1 March 1927 as Liga Piłki Nożnej (Polish pronunciation: [ˈlʲiɡa ˈpiwki ˈnɔʐnɛj]), but the Polish Football Association (Polish: Polski Związek Piłki Nożnej, PZPN) had been in existence since 20 December 1919, a year after the independence of Poland in 1918. The first games of the freshly created league took place on 3 April 1927, while first national non-league football championship took place in 1920. A total of 83 teams have played in the top division of Polish football since the founding of the league, of which 18 clubs have won the title. The current champions are Raków Częstochowa, who won their 1st title in 2022–23 season. 1927–1948: Liga 1949–2004: I liga 2004: Idea Ekstraklasa 2005–2009: Orange Ekstraklasa 2011–2015: T-Mobile Ekstraklasa 2016–2018: Lotto Ekstraklasa 2019–: PKO Bank Polski Ekstraklasa On 4–5 December 1926 in Warsaw, representatives from several Polish clubs met for the purpose of discussing the creation of a league. It is unknown where the idea of a Polish league originated from, however a national league was thought to be a much more practical solution than hitherto practiced two-stage system of regional matches followed by a national match. To dismay of clubs' officials, the PZPN was not receptive to the idea of a national league and therefore sought to thwart it. However, it turned out that virtually all but one of the Polish clubs supported the idea. The decision to create it was made regardless what PZPN's representatives thought of it. In late February 1927, at the PZPN's meeting in Warsaw, its officials openly opposed the formation of a league, but the clubs, allegedly egged on by some generals from the Polish Army (which, after May Coup of 1926, played a key role in all aspects of public life), proceeded anyway. The creation of the League was announced on 1 March 1927. The only opponent of the league's formation was Cracovia – a very influential and strong organization in Polish football of the 1920s. Cracovia's boycott was because its chairman, Dr. Edward Cetnarowski, at the same time held the post of the director of the PZPN. Cetnarowski was a personality known not only in Poland, but also in other countries. It was due to his efforts that in September 1923, Cracovia toured Spain, drawing 1–1 with Barcelona and losing 0–1 to Real Madrid. In October, also thanks to Cetnarowski, Sevilla travelled to Kraków, losing 2–3 to Cracovia. Games of the first championships started on 3 April 1927. All major teams (except for Cracovia) took part in it. This is the list of the teams (in the order they finished in November 1927): Wisła Kraków 1. FC Kattowitz Warta Poznań Pogoń Lwów Legia Warsaw Klub Turystów Łódź ŁKS Łódź Polonia Warsaw Czarni Lwów Toruński KS Toruń Hasmonea Lwów Ruch Chorzów Warszawianka Warsaw Jutrzenka Kraków In this first season of the league, fight for championship was decided between two powerful teams – Wisła Kraków and 1.FC Katowice. This rivalry was treated very seriously, not only by the two sides involved, but also by the whole nation. 1.FC was regarded as the team supported by German minority, while Wisła, at the end of this historic season, represented ambitions of all Poles. Some time in the fall of 1927 in Katowice, an ill-fated game between 1.FC and Wisła took place. Stakes were very high – the winner would become the champion. Kraków's side won 2–0 and became the champion. 1.FC finished second, third was Warta Poznań. In 1928, Cracovia finally decided to enter the league, which was gladly accepted by all fans of football. However, championships were once again won by Wisła, with such excellent players as Henryk Reyman, Mieczysław Balcer and Jan Kotlarczyk. Warta Poznań was second and Legia Warsaw third. This was also the last year of 1.FC's glory. The team finished fifth, to be relegated forever at the end of 1929 season. In 1929, another team (after Cracovia, Pogon Lwów and Wisła) was added to the list of champions of Poland. This time it was Warta Poznań, which finished one point ahead of Garbarnia Kraków. However, after the last game, on 1 December 1929, it was Garbarnia Kraków that was celebrating the championship. Two weeks later, in mid-December, PZPN's officials changed the result of the Warta – Klub Turystow Łódź game. Originally, Warta lost 1–2, but due to walkover (it was decided that one of Łódź's players did not have all necessary documents), this was changed to 3–0 in favor of Poznań's side. As a result of the decision, Warta (with 33 points) became the champion, Garbarnia finished second with 32 points and Klub Turystow was relegated. In 1930, Cracovia regained the championship, (to repeat this success in 1932) and a year later another Kraków's side, Garbarnia, won the league. It is clear that the 1927–1932 period was marked by dominance of teams from Kraków. During this time, only once (Warta Poznań, 1929) the championship was won by a side from a different city. The 1931 champion, Garbarnia, was unique as this was the first time that the league had been won by a side whose all players had been bought from other teams. As has been said, the early 1930s marked a decline of the dominance of Kraków and Lwów as centers of Polish football. The point of gravity slowly moved towards west – to Polish part of Upper Silesia, which had belonged to Poland since 1921 (see: Silesian Uprisings). In 1932 the champion was Cracovia, but starting in 1933, Ruch Chorzów (then: Ruch Wielkie Hajduki) completely dominated the league, being the champion for four times in a row. Ruch, with such excellent players as Teodor Peterek, Ernest Wilimowski and Gerard Wodarz was by far the best team in those years. For example, in 1934 it finished seven points ahead of second Cracovia. Other important teams of these years were: Cracovia, Wisła Kraków, Pogoń Lwów and Warta Poznań. In 1933 and 1934 there were 12 teams in the League. In 1935 this number was cut to 11 and in 1936 – to 10. Football officials did it on purpose – with fewer teams, the competition was supposed to be harder, which would attract fans to the stadiums. However, supporters' turnout was not impressive, with Ruch Chorzów as the most popular team, both at home and away. In late 1935 (the league held its games in the spring-summer-fall system) fans were shocked to find that Cracovia, the legend of this sport, was relegated to the A-class. Kraków's side absence lasted for a year – it returned in 1937, to become the champion. Ruch Chorzów was still the dominant team, winning the Championships in 1936 and 1938. In 1937 Ruch's streak of four consecutive champions was broken by Cracovia, and in 1939 the championships were not finished. By 31 August 1939, after some 12 games, Ruch was the leader of the 10-team League. Last games of this summer occurred on 20 August. Then, a break was planned, because the National Team was going to play a few international friendlies. Games were to be re-introduced on 10 September. This is the list of the ten teams that participated in last, historic games for championships of interwar Poland. Teams are presented according to their position on the table, as of 31 August 1939: Ruch Chorzów Wisła Kraków Pogoń Lwów AKS Chorzów Warta Poznań Cracovia Polonia Warsaw Garbarnia Kraków Warszawianka Warsaw Union Touring Łódź As a result of the Second World War, the borders of Poland changed significantly. Lwów, one of the centers of Polish football (with such teams as Pogoń Lwów, Czarni Lwów and Lechia Lwów) was annexed by Soviet Union and all these teams ceased to exist. Lwów's football officials and players moved westwards, creating such clubs as Polonia Bytom, Odra Opole and Pogoń Szczecin (see: Recovered Territories). Another important center, Wilno (with the team Śmigły Wilno), was also annexed by the Soviets (see: Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union). In exchange, Poland gained a large swath of formerly German territory in particular in Silesia, with its capital Wrocław (home of double champion Śląsk Wrocław) and towns such as Zabrze (home of 14-times champion Górnik Zabrze), Bytom (home of champions Polonia Bytom and Szombierki Bytom) and Lubin (home of double champion Zagłębie Lubin). 18 teams played in the league between seasons of 1992 and 1998. The Ekstraklasa underwent significant changes during the 1950s, reflecting the turbulent political and social landscape of post-World War II Poland. The Ekstraklasa was officially established as the top division of Polish football. It replaced the previous Polish Football Championship, which had been in existence since the 1920s. The inaugural season of the Ekstraklasa featured eight teams from various Polish cities, including Warsaw, Krakow, Gdynia, and others. Ruch Chorzów became the first champions of the newly formed league, winning the title in the 1950 season. Throughout these years, the league format remained relatively stable, with the same number of teams participating each season. Legia Warsaw asserted its dominance during this period, winning three consecutive Ekstraklasa titles in 1951, 1952, and 1953. The Ekstraklasa expanded its format, increasing the number of teams from eight to ten for the 1954 season. Gwardia Warsaw won their first and only Ekstraklasa title during this season. The league continued with ten teams participating in the competition over the next three seasons. Górnik Zabrze emerged as the dominant force, securing three consecutive league titles in 1955, 1956, and 1957. The Ekstraklasa expanded once more, growing to include 12 teams for the 1958 season. Legia Warsaw regained its position at the top, clinching the league title in this year. The league contracted back to ten teams for the 1959 season. Górnik Zabrze returned to their winning ways, capturing the league title for the fourth time in the decade. Overall, the 1950s marked a period of consolidation and growth for the Ekstraklasa. Despite being a relatively young league, it experienced a stable format and saw some clubs begin to assert their dominance. This era laid the groundwork for further developments and successes in the coming decades. The Ekstraklasa continued with ten teams participating in the competition, maintaining the same format as the previous season. Górnik Zabrze extended their dominance, securing their fifth league title in a decade. The league expanded its format once again, this time to 12 teams for the 1961 season. Legia Warsaw reclaimed the top spot, winning the league title. Over these two seasons, the league maintained the same 12-team format. Górnik Zabrze returned to their winning ways, clinching two more league titles in 1962 and 1963. The Ekstraklasa reduced the number of teams from 12 to 10 for the 1964 season. Górnik Zabrze continued their exceptional run, securing the league title yet again. The league featured ten teams throughout these seasons. Polonia Bytom enjoyed a successful period, winning back-to-back league titles in 1965 and 1966. The Ekstraklasa expanded to include 14 teams for both the 1967 and 1968 seasons. Legia Warsaw reestablished their dominance, clinching two league titles in consecutive years. The league contracted back to 12 teams for the 1969 season. Ruch Chorzów returned to their winning form, capturing the league title. Overall, the 1960s saw the Ekstraklasa continue to evolve and grow, with various changes to the number of participating teams. Górnik Zabrze and Legia Warsaw remained dominant forces, but other clubs like Polonia Bytom and Ruch Chorzów also had their moments of success. The decade was marked by competitive football and showcased the emergence of new talents in the Polish football landscape. The 1970s were a significant period in the history of the Ekstraklasa. During this decade, Polish football experienced both domestic and international success, with several teams and players leaving their mark on the league. In the early 1970s, Ruch Chorzów and Górnik Zabrze were dominant forces in the Ekstraklasa. Ruch Chorzów secured back-to-back championships in the 1973-74 and 1974-75 seasons. Górnik Zabrze, on the other hand, had already established themselves as a powerhouse, having won numerous league titles in the 1960s, and continued to be competitive throughout the 1970s. The mid-1970s saw the emergence of another strong contender, Widzew Łódź. They clinched their first Ekstraklasa title in the 1975-76 season, breaking the monopoly of Ruch Chorzów and Górnik Zabrze. Widzew Łódź's success signaled a shift in the balance of power within the league. Meanwhile, Legia Warsaw, one of Poland's most successful clubs, experienced a resurgence in the late 1970s. They secured Ekstraklasa titles in the 1976-77 and 1978-79 seasons, adding to their already impressive trophy cabinet. Legia Warsaw also made notable achievements in European competitions during this period. On the international stage, Polish football gained global recognition with the national team's success in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. Several players from Ekstraklasa clubs were key contributors to the national team's historic third-place finish, further enhancing the league's reputation. In summary, the 1970s were a dynamic and competitive era in the history of the Ekstraklasa. The decade witnessed the continued success of established clubs like Górnik Zabrze and Ruch Chorzów, the rise of new contenders like Widzew Łódź, and the resurgence of Legia Warsaw. Additionally, the international achievements of the Polish national team added to the prestige of the Ekstraklasa during this period. The 1980s were a tumultuous and challenging period for the Ekstraklasa. The decade was marked by political unrest, economic difficulties, and a decline in the overall performance of Polish football on both domestic and international fronts. One of the defining moments of the 1980s was the imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981. This had a profound impact on the country's football landscape, disrupting the regular functioning of the Ekstraklasa and leading to the suspension of the league for a brief period. Amidst the political turmoil, certain football clubs managed to assert their dominance in the league. Widzew Łódź continued their success from the late 1970s into the early 1980s, clinching Ekstraklasa titles in the 1980-81 and 1981-82 seasons. Their consistency during this period showcased their resilience in challenging circumstances. Górnik Zabrze and Legia Warsaw remained competitive but faced increased challenges, both domestically and in European competitions. The economic difficulties in Poland had an impact on the financial stability of football clubs, affecting their ability to attract and retain top talent. The latter part of the 1980s witnessed a shift in power, with Lech Poznań emerging as a dominant force in the Ekstraklasa. Lech Poznań secured consecutive league titles in the 1982-83 and 1983-84 seasons. Their success brought a new chapter to the league, with fresh faces making an impact on the domestic football scene. Despite the challenges at the club level, the Polish national team achieved a notable milestone in the 1980s. They finished in 3rd place at the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain, showcasing the resilience of Polish football despite the adverse conditions. In summary, the 1980s were a challenging period for the Ekstraklasa, marked by political and economic difficulties that impacted the overall state of Polish football. While certain clubs like Widzew Łódź and Lech Poznań enjoyed success, the era was characterized by a decline in the league's competitive stature compared to previous decades. The challenges faced by clubs in the 1980s set the stage for efforts to revitalize and modernize Polish football in the subsequent years. The 1990s marked a period of transition and transformation for the Ekstraklasa. The decade witnessed the country's transition to a market economy, which had a profound impact on football, leading to both challenges and opportunities for the league. Lech Poznań continued their success from the late 1980s into the early 1990s, winning the Ekstraklasa title in the 1991-92 season. The club's achievements reflected a certain stability in performance, even as other clubs adapted to the changing economic and football landscape. Widzew Łódź and Legia Warsaw remained competitive during the early 1990s, with Legia achieving success in both domestic and international competitions. Legia Warsaw notably reached the quarterfinals of the UEFA Cup during the 1990-91 season, showcasing the club's resilience on the European stage. The latter part of the decade saw a shift in the balance of power within the Ekstraklasa. Clubs like GKS Katowice, Widzew Łódź, and Wisła Kraków emerged as strong contenders for the league title. Wisła Kraków, in particular, had a successful run in the late 1990s, securing back-to-back Ekstraklasa championships in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons. The 1990s also saw the emergence of talented players who would go on to make significant contributions to both the Ekstraklasa and the national team. Despite the challenges posed by economic factors and changes in the football landscape, Polish football experienced a sense of renewal and dynamism in the 1990s. The increased competitiveness within the league and the emergence of new talent laid the groundwork for a more vibrant and evolving Ekstraklasa in the years to come. In summary, the 1990s were a transformative period for the Ekstraklasa, characterized by a changing economic landscape, the emergence of new contenders, and the continued success of established clubs. The decade set the stage for further developments in Polish football, with increased competition and a focus on nurturing young talent. The 2000s represented a period of continued evolution and competitiveness for the Ekstraklasa. This decade featured a mix of established clubs maintaining their dominance, the emergence of new contenders, and increased efforts to modernize and elevate the overall standard of Polish football. Wisła Kraków continued their success from the late 1990s into the early 2000s, securing multiple Ekstraklasa titles during this period. The club's triumphs in the league, along with their participation in European competitions, contributed to their status as a major force in Polish football. Legia Warsaw also experienced a resurgence, winning the Ekstraklasa title in the 2001-02 and 2005-06 seasons. Their achievements not only showcased their domestic prowess but also marked a return to competitiveness on the European stage. The 2000s witnessed the rise of several other clubs, including Lech Poznań, who secured the Ekstraklasa title in the 2009-10 season. Lech Poznań's success reflected a broader trend of increased parity and competition within the league. Efforts to modernize and professionalize Polish football gained momentum during this decade. The league underwent structural changes, and there were initiatives to improve training facilities, youth development programs, and overall infrastructure. These efforts aimed to enhance the quality of the Ekstraklasa and raise the level of competitiveness. The 2000s also saw the emergence of notable players who left a lasting impact on the league and, in some cases, went on to have successful careers in international football. While the 2000s brought positive developments for Polish football, there were also challenges, including financial struggles for some clubs and occasional incidents of fan violence. These issues highlighted the need for continued efforts to address the various aspects of the football ecosystem. In summary, the 2000s were a period of transition and growth for the Ekstraklasa, marked by the continued success of established clubs, the emergence of new contenders, and efforts to modernize and professionalize Polish football. The decade set the stage for further advancements in the subsequent years, as the league continued to adapt to changing dynamics within the football landscape. The 2010s brought further changes and developments to the Ekstraklasa. This decade witnessed a continuation of the league's efforts to modernize, increase competitiveness, and enhance the overall quality of Polish football. Legia Warsaw emerged as a dominant force, securing multiple Ekstraklasa titles throughout the decade. Legia not only dominated domestically but also made notable appearances in European competitions, reaching the UEFA Europa League group stages and the UEFA Champions League play-offs. Lech Poznań continued to be a strong contender, winning the Ekstraklasa title in the 2009-10 season and consistently finishing among the top teams in subsequent years. The competition for the championship became more intense, with several clubs vying for the top spot, including Wisła Kraków, Śląsk Wrocław, and Jagiellonia Białystok. The 2010s were marked by a growing emphasis on youth development and the nurturing of homegrown talent within the league. Clubs invested in their academies, and the emergence of young, talented players became a noticeable trend. This focus on youth development aimed to strengthen the national team and contribute to the long-term success of Polish football. Financial stability remained a challenge for some clubs, leading to occasional struggles and changes in ownership. However, the league continued to attract international attention, and the quality of play improved, making the Ekstraklasa a more competitive and entertaining competition. The implementation of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in the later years of the decade aimed to enhance the fairness and accuracy of officiating in the league. This technological advancement reflected the broader trend of incorporating modern tools and practices to improve the overall football experience. On the international stage, Polish football continued to produce talented players who made their mark in European leagues. The national team also achieved notable success, making it to the quarterfinals at UEFA Euro 2016. In summary, the 2010s were a period of continued growth and development for the Ekstraklasa, marked by the dominance of clubs like Legia Warsaw, increased competition, a focus on youth development, and efforts to modernize various aspects of the league. The decade laid the groundwork for further advancements in Polish football as it moved into the 2020s. There are 18 clubs in the Ekstraklasa. During the course of the season each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 34 games. From the 2013–14 till the 2019–20 season, after the 30th round the table was divided into 'champion' (top eight teams) and 'relegation' (bottom eight teams) groups. Each team played seven more games (teams ranked 1–4 and 9–12 would host four games at home). The 2016–17 season was the last when teams started an extra round with half the points (rounded up) achieved during the first phase of 30 matches. The changes extended the season to a total of 296 matches played. The 2021–22 season started with 18 teams, instead of 16.
