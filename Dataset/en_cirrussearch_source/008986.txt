European Hit Radio (EHR, Latvian: Eiropas Hītu Radio, Lithuanian: Europos Hitų Radijas) is a commercial radio station in the Baltic states. Music compiled on EHR singles charts, are mostly aired. EHR's history can be traced back to 1992, when Uģis Polis and Jānis Krauklis founded Radio Dejas, which was the first non-governmental radio station in Latvia. Radio Dejas was broadcast from a flat in Tērbatas Street, Riga and reached only the city of Riga. In 1994 they renamed the radio station Super FM. In 2002, European Hit Radio started a new policy - to reflect the music situation in Europe with fresh music and charts from all European countries[citation needed]. In 2004 European Hit Radio went off air in Estonia after losing its broadcasting license competition to a new Adult Contemporary station, Radio 3.
