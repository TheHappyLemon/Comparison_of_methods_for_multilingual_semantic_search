Skulte (German: Adiamünde) is a village in Limbaži Municipality, Latvia, and the centre of Skulte Parish. Skulte is an ancient settlement on the highway that led from Riga to Estonia. The ancient name of the county, Ademinde, comes from the Livonian word adia - edge and the German word Münde - mouth; "at the mouth of edge". Skulte became a larger settlement in the 1930s after the division of building plots in the territory of the former Skulte manor (Adiamünde). In 1933, Skultei was granted the status of a densely populated place (village). During the Latvian SSR between the railway and the parish border on both sides of Aģes several colonies (villages) of summer houses and small gardens were established along the river, which were later administratively included in the territory of Skulte village. The Skulte burial chapel is an architectural monument of local importance. Skulte has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb). Within existing limits, according to CSB data.
