Perm Krai (Russian: Пе́рмский край, romanized: Permsky kray, IPA: [ˈpʲɛrmskʲɪj ˈkraj]; Komi-Permyak: Перем ладор, romanized: Perem lador) is a federal subject of Russia (a krai), located in Eastern Europe. Its administrative center is Perm. The population of the krai was 2,532,405 (2021 Census). The krai was formed on 1 December 2005 as a result of the 2004 referendum on the merger of Perm Oblast and Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug. Komi-Permyak Okrug retained its autonomous status within Perm Krai during the transitional period of 2006–2008. It also retained a budget separate from that of the krai, keeping all federal transfers. Starting in 2009, Komi-Permyak Okrug's budget became subject to the budgeting law of Perm Krai. The transitional period was implemented in part because Komi-Permyak Okrug relied heavily on federal subsidies, and an abrupt cut would have been detrimental to its economy. Perm Krai is located to the east of the East European Plain and the western slope of the Middle Ural Mountains. 99.8% of its area is in Europe, 0.2% in Asia. length from north to south – 645 kilometres (401 mi) length from west to east – 417.5 kilometres (259.4 mi) The krai borders the Komi Republic in the north, Kirov Oblast in the northwest, the Udmurt Republic in the southwest, the Republic of Bashkortostan in the south, and Sverdlovsk Oblast in the east. The krai borders stretch for over 2,200 kilometres (1,400 mi). The highest point is Mount Tulymsky Kamen at 1,496 metres (4,908 ft). Rivers of Perm Krai belong to the Kama River Basin, the largest tributary of Volga River. There are more than 29,000 rivers in Perm Krai. The total length of all rivers is more than 90,000 kilometres (56,000 mi). Only two rivers in Perm Krai have lengths exceeding 500 kilometres (310 mi). They are the Kama River at 1,805 kilometres (1,122 mi) and the Chusovaya River, 592 kilometres (368 mi). There are about 40 rivers with lengths from 100 to 500 kilometres (62 to 311 mi). The longest of them are: Sylva River — 493 km (306 mi) Kolva River — 460 km (285 mi) Vishera River — 415 km (258 mi) Yayva River — 403 km (250 mi) Kosva River — 283 km (176 mi) Kosa River — 267 km (165 mi) Veslyana River — 266 km (165 mi) Inva River — 257 km (159 mi) Obva River — 247 km (153 mi) There are also many small rivers, but some of them have historical significance, for example Yegoshikha River, at the mouth of which the city of Perm was founded. Perm Krai has a continental climate. Winters are long and snowy, with average temperatures in January varying from −18 °C (0 °F) in the northeast part of krai to −15 °C (5 °F) in southwest part. The record lowest recorded temperature was −53 °C (−63 °F) (in the north).[citation needed] Perm Krai has an abundance of minerals. Oil, natural gas, gold, diamonds, chromites, peat, limestone and building materials are among the many natural resources extracted. Oil in its area was first discovered in 1929 near settlement Verhnechusovskie Gorodki. Currently there are more than 180 oil and gas fields known. Among them the developed ones are: 89 oil, 2 gas and 18 both oil and gas fields. Most of them are small and based in the central and southern districts of the krai. The northern fields are less developed because the oil lies deep under salt layers. Coal has been mined in Perm Krai for more than 200 years. For a long time it played an important role in the fuel and energy balance in the region. Maximum mining was in 1960 when it reached 12 million tonnes. Mining then decreased and there are no exploration of new fields. The Verkhnekamskoye deposit of potassium salts is one of the largest in the world. It is approx. 1,800 km2 (690 sq mi), and the thickness of the salt layers reaches 514 m. In 1841 the geological Permian Period was named after strata of rocks from that time were found in this area. Forests cover about 71% of Perm Krai's area. Coniferous forests predominate, with deciduous forests more common in the south. There are 62 species of mammals, more than 270 species of birds, 39 species of fishes, 6 species of reptile and 9 species of amphibians.[citation needed] Three nature reserves are located in Perm Krai: Basegi, Vishera, Preduralie. During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Perm CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia. Legislative power in the region is exercised by the Legislative Assembly of Perm Krai, which consists of 60 deputies elected by the inhabitants of the Krai for a term of five years. 30 deputies are elected from party lists (proportional system), and the remaining 30 from single-member districts (majority system). To receive seats on party lists, parties must overcome the 5% threshold (for the first convocation - 7%). The first elections of deputies to the Legislative Assembly of the Perm Krai were held on 3 December 2006. Party list places: 1st Convocation (2006): United Russia (12), Union of Right Forces (6), Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (5), Russian Party of Pensioners (4), Communist Party of the Russian Federation (3); 2nd Convocation (2011): United Russia (14), CPRF (6), LDPR (5), A Just Russia (5); 3rd Convocation (2016): United Russia (16), CPRF (6), LDPR (5), A Just Russia (3); 4th Convocation (2021): United Russia (13), CPRF (9), A Just Russia (3), LDPR (3), New People (2).

It is answerable to the regional MVD and the governor of Perm Krai. The chief of police is Yuri Valyaev. Administratively, the krai is divided into thirty-three districts, fourteen cities of krai significance, and one closed administrative-territorial formation. Six administrative districts are grouped into Komi-Permyak Okrug, which is an administrative unit with special status formed within Perm Krai as a result of the 2005 merger of Perm Oblast and Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug, both of which used to be the federal subjects. Municipally, the territories of all administrative districts and those of nine cities of krai significance are incorporated as municipal districts.
