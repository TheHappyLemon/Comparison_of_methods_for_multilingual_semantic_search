This article outlines notable events occurring in 2003 in spaceflight, including major launches and EVAs. On Saturday, February 1, 2003, Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated as it reentered the atmosphere over Texas and Louisiana, killing all seven astronauts on board. It was the second Space Shuttle mission to end in disaster, after the loss of Challenger and crew in 1986. Final Columbia mission Space Shuttle Columbia launches on its last mission, STS-107.

Shenzhou 5 (Chinese: 神舟五号; pinyin: Shénzhōu Wǔ Hào, see § Etymology) was the first human spaceflight mission of the Chinese space program, launched on 15 October 2003. The Shenzhou spacecraft was launched on a Long March 2F launch vehicle. There had been four previous flights of uncrewed Shenzhou missions since 1999. China became the third country in the world to have independent human spaceflight capability after the Soviet Union (later, Russia) and the United States. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Ariane Atlas Delta H-II Long March Pegasus R-7 R-14 Titan Universal Rocket Zenit Others   Ariane 4   Ariane 5   Atlas II   Atlas III   Atlas V   Delta II   Delta IV   H-IIA   Long March 2   Long March 3   Long March 4   Pegasus   Molniya-M   Soyuz-U   Soyuz-FG   Kosmos-3M   Titan 23G   Titan IV   Proton-K   Rokot   Strela   Zenit-3SL   Others 5 10 15 20 25 30 Brazil China France India International waters Japan Kazakhstan Russia United States   Alcântara   Jiuquan   Taiyuan   Xichang   Kourou   Satish Dhawan   Ocean Odyssey   Tanegashima   Uchinoura   Baikonur   Plesetsk   Cape Canaveral   Kennedy   Vandenberg 5 10 15 20 25 30 Transatmospheric Low Earth Medium Earth Geosynchronous / transfer High Earth Heliocentric   Transatmospheric   Low Earth   Low Earth (ISS)   Low Earth (SSO)   Low Earth (retrograde)   Medium Earth   Geosychronous (transfer)   Inclined GSO   High Earth   Heliocentric Bergin, Chris.
