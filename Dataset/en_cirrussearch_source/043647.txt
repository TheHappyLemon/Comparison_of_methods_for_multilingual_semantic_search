Yassine Meriah (Arabic: ياسين مرياح; born 2 July 1993) is a Tunisian professional footballer who plays as a defender for Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1 club Espérance de Tunis and the Tunisia national team. Mariah was formed in Association d'Ariana, the team that was active in the Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 2. In the 2013–14 season, he was transferred to Étoile de Métlaoui when he was 20 years old. After spending two seasons with the team, he was prominently featured and invited to the Tunisian Olympic team. He attracted the attention of the officials of Club Sfaxien, one of the most important teams in the Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1 who sought to sign with him, starting from the 2014–15 season. From his first season with Club Sfaxien, Meriah was a key figure in the squad and played in many of the team's defensive positions. On 28 July 2018, Meriah joined Olympiacos for an estimated transfer fee of €1,500,000, signing a four-year contract. On 2 September 2018, he scored his first goal for the club in a 5–0 home win against PAS Giannina. On 31 January 2020, Meriah officially loaned in Süper Lig club Kasımpaşa, until the end of the 2019–20 season, with a €5 million buyout clause expected in the summer. Meriah started this year as de facto leader in Olympiakos defence, having a great presence in the Champions League qualifiers. Later, however, there were some games in which he made mistakes, so he was sidelined. On 13 September 2020, he signed a long season loan with another Süper Lig club Çaykur Rizespor. On 28 July 2021, Meriah joined Al Ain for a reported transfer fee of €2 million signing a two-year contract. On 4 August 2022, Meriah joined Espérance de Tunis as a free agent signing a two-year contract. Meriah's success with his club led him to the Tunisia national team for the first time by coach Georges Leekens on 13 June 2015 against Morocco in 2016 African Nations Championship qualification. He scored his first goal against DR Congo in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification. In May 2018 he was named in Tunisia's final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.
