Chak Chak is a popular fried dough food in Tatarstan and Bashkortostan. Chak chak is made from unleavened dough cut and rolled into hazelnut-sized balls, which are then deep-fried in oil. Optionally, hazelnuts or dried fruit (e.g. apricots and raisins) are added to the mixture. The fried balls are stacked in a mound in a special mold and drenched with hot honey. After cooling and hardening, chak chak may optionally be decorated with hazelnuts and dried fruits. Traditional wedding chak chak is larger and is often covered with candies and dragées. The biggest chak chak weighed 402.4 kilograms (887 lb) and was prepared on 14 June 2018 during start of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Kazan. If the dough is fried as noodles, chak chak is called Boxara käläwäse (Бохара кәләвәсе, [bɔxɑˈrɑ kælæwæˈse], i.e. Bukharan käläwä ). Kazakh shek-shek is similar to Boxara käläwäse. Uzbek chakchak comes as half rounded balls, noodles, and flakes. Tajik chakchak comes in both types, as balls and as noodles.
