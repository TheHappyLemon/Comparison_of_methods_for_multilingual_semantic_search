The 2022–23 UEFA Europa League was the 52nd season of Europe's secondary club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 14th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the UEFA Europa League. Sevilla defeated Roma in the final played at the Puskás Aréna in Budapest, Hungary, 4–1 on penalties following a 1–1 draw after extra time, winning the competition for a record-extending seventh time. Budapest was originally scheduled to host the final match for the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League, but several hosts were shifted because of the delay and ultimate relocation of the 2020 final due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As winners of the tournament, Sevilla automatically qualified for the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League group stage and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League, Manchester City, in the 2023 UEFA Super Cup. As the title holders, Eintracht Frankfurt qualified for the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League. They were unable to defend their title after advancing to the knockout phase. A total of 57 teams from 33 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League. Among them, 15 associations had teams directly qualifying for the Europa League, while for the other 40 associations that did not have any teams directly qualifying, 18 of them had teams playing after being transferred from the Champions League (the only member associations which could not have a participant were Russia and Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league, and could only enter their cup winner into the UEFA Europa Conference League given their association ranking). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: The title holders of the UEFA Europa Conference League were given an entry in the Europa League (as they did not qualify for the Champions League group stage). Associations 1–5 each had two teams qualify. Associations 6–7 and 9–15 each had one team qualify. 36 teams eliminated from the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League were transferred to the Europa League. For the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2021 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2016–17 to 2020–21. Apart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations may have had additional teams participating in the Europa League, as noted below: (UCL) – Additional teams transferred from the UEFA Champions League (UECL) – Additional berth for UEFA Europa Conference League title holders The following is the access list for this season. Due to the suspension of Russia for the 2022–23 European season, the following changes to the access list were made: The cup winners of associations 13 (Turkey) and 14 (Denmark) enter the play-off round instead of the third qualifying round. The cup winners of association 16 (Serbia) enter the third qualifying round instead of the Europa Conference League second qualifying round. Since the Europa Conference League title holders (Roma) qualified through their league position, the following changes to the access list were made: The cup winners of association 7 (Netherlands) enter the group stage instead of the play-off round. The cup winners of association 15 (Cyprus) enter the play-off round instead of the third qualifying round. The cup winners of association 17 (Czech Republic) enter the third qualifying round instead of the Europa Conference League second qualifying round. A Europa League place was vacated when a team qualified for both the Champions League and the Europa League, or qualified for the Europa League by more than one method. When a place was vacated, it was redistributed within the national association by the following rules: When the domestic cup winners (considered as the "highest-placed" qualifier within the national association with the latest starting round) also qualified for the Champions League, their Europa League place was vacated. As a result, the highest-placed team in the league which had not yet qualified for European competitions qualified for the Europa League, with the Europa League qualifiers which finished above them in the league moved up one "place". When the domestic cup winners also qualified for the Europa League through league position, their place through the league position was vacated. As a result, the highest-placed team in the league which had not yet qualified for European competitions qualified for the Europa League, with the Europa League qualifiers which finished above them in the league moved up one "place" if possible. For associations where a Europa League place was reserved for either the League Cup or end-of-season European competition play-offs winners, they always qualified for the Europa League as the "lowest-placed" qualifier. If the League Cup winners had already qualified for European competitions through other methods, this reserved Europa League place was taken by the highest-placed team in the league which had not yet qualified for European competitions. The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round: ECL: Europa Conference League title holders CW: Cup winners 4th, 5th, etc.: League position of the previous season Abd-: League positions of abandoned season as determined by the national association; all teams were subject to approval by UEFA UCL: Transferred from the Champions League GS: Third-placed teams from the group stage CH/LP PO: Losers from the play-off round (Champions/League Path) CH/LP Q3: Losers from the third qualifying round (Champions/League Path) CH/LP Q2: Losers from the second qualifying round (Champions/League Path) The third qualifying round was divided into Champions Path (CH) and Main Path (MP).

In the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows: In the draw for the knockout round play-offs, the eight group runners-up were seeded, and the eight Champions League group third-placed teams were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. In the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight winners of the knockout round play-offs were unseeded. Again, the seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. In the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there were no seedings, and teams from the same association could be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals were held together before the quarter-finals were played, the identity of the quarter-final winners was not known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw was also held to determine which semi-final winner would be designated as the "home" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it was played at a neutral venue). The draw for the knockout round play-offs was held on 7 November 2022, 13:00 CET. The first legs were played on 16 February, and the second legs were played on 23 February 2023. The draw for the round of 16 was held on 24 February 2023, 12:00 CET. The first legs were played on 9 March, and the second legs were played on 16 March 2023. The draw for the quarter-finals was held on 17 March 2023, 13:00 CET. The first legs were played on 13 April, and the second legs were played on 20 April 2023. The draw for the semi-finals was held on 17 March 2023, 13:00 CET, after the quarter-final draw. The first legs were played on 11 May, and the second legs were played on 18 May 2023. The final was played on 31 May 2023 at the Puskás Aréna in Budapest. A draw was held on 17 March 2023, after the quarter-final and semi-final draws, to determine the "home" team for administrative purposes. 31 May 2023 (2023-05-31) 21:00 CEST Puskás Aréna, Budapest Attendance: 61,476 Referee: Anthony Taylor (England) Statistics exclude qualifying round and play-off round.
