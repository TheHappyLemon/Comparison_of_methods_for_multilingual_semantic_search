The ZIL-130 is a Soviet/Russian truck produced by ZIL in Moscow, Russia. The first prototype (named Ukraina, means Ukraine) was built in 1956. Production began in 1962, while mass production started in 1964. It was one of the most numerous cargo trucks in the USSR and Russia, in total ZIL built 3,380,000 trucks up to 1994. In 1995, production was moved to the now-defunct Ural Motor Plant (UamZ, its trucks were known as UamZ-43140). The ZIL plant started working on a replacement for the ZIL-164, right after De-Stalinization took place. The first prototype was built some months later and had an all-new cabin, as well as a wider, wraparound windshield and a V-shaped emblem identical to 1956 Ford F-Series trucks. The new model retained little from its predecessor, with a new V8 engine (displacing 6.0 liters) and a more reinforced frame. The newer truck was slightly shorter than the ZIL-164 truck. Mass-production started in 1964 under the ZIL-130 name, and soon the ZIL-164 was discontinued in favor of its more modern successor. The ZIL-130 received the latest features adopted by the global car industry of the 1950s while not being based on any foreign model and having a unique chassis, cabin and other parts. In 1965, production of the heavier ZIL-131 started. In 1986, ZIL introduced the newer ZIL-4331, but production of the ZIL-130 continued even after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, eventually ending in 1995, when the design tooling was sold to UamZ and production continued as the UamZ-43140 truck until 2012. Like the broadly similar 3.5 ton GAZ-53, the ZIL-130 was also available in a 4-door double cab configuration, but only in fire engine forms. Over the course of production, there were two modernizations of the ZIL-130 in 1966 and 1977. After 1977, the radiator enclosure was changed.
