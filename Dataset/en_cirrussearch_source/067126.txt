The Kaban Lakes (Tatar: Кабан күле; Russian: Кабан, lit. 'Boar') are a system of lakes in Kazan, Republic of Tatarstan, Russia that includes Nizhny (Blizhny) Kaban, Verkhny Kaban, and Sredny Kaban. They make up Tatarstan's largest lake, measuring 1.86 square kilometers (0.72 square miles) in total. The lakes are connected with the Kazanka River by the Bolaq channel and a subterranean channel from Bolaq-Kazansu. The city's sewage system also connects them to the Volga River. The Thousandth Anniversary of Islam Mosque is situated on the bank. Also in Kazan there is a famous "Kaban Lake" similar to the name of the "Kuban River" - which translates from Nogai as "overflowing". The name originated in the 14th century with the Kipchak Tatars who came to these places, especially Astrakhan Nogais. The main now central Bauman Street that leads to the Kremlin is one of the oldest streets in Kazan. In the era of the Kazan Khanate, it was called the Nogai district.
