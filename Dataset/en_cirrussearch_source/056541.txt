Listed at 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) and 185 pounds (84 kg), Fox has primarily played the point guard position throughout his career. He is left-handed. Coming out of Kentucky, Fox was highly regarded among scouts for his quickness, speed, and athleticism. These attributes combined make Fox one of the most dangerous players on the fast break and driving to the rim. Fox himself stated in 2018 "If we’re talking about from baseline to baseline with the ball in my hands, I’m definitely the fastest person in the league." Fox is a high end finisher at the rim, being able to use his body control and leaping ability to finish layups and draw fouls and often using his speed and quickness to blow by defenders. Fox is considered to be a poor 3-point shooter, as during the 2019–2020 NBA season, Fox shot a career low 29.2% shooting percentage from three. Fox has also demonstrated good passing ability, averaging around seven assists per game. Fox generates most of his assists running the pick and roll and the fast break. On defense, Fox can be exploited by bigger guards because of his small frame, but can intercept passes and makes quick rotations due to his elite quickness and nearly 6-foot 7 inch wingspan. Fox was born to his parents Aaron and Lorainne Harris-Fox and has one brother named Quentin Fox. Since elementary school, Fox goes by the nicknames “Fox”, “Swipa”, and “Swipa da Fox”, inspired by Swiper the Fox from the Nickelodeon television series Dora the Explorer and his ability on the court to record steals. Fox chose the number zero at Kentucky because he “fears no one”, giving his original number five to teammate Malik Monk. According to his high school coach, Fox would come to school at 6 AM and practice in the gym every morning. Fox would sleep on the couch almost every night and play the NBA 2K video game series. This, according to his father, is one of the reasons he has developed into the player that he is today. Fox signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Nike prior to the 2017 NBA draft. Fox is also a fan of the Dragon Ball Z anime series and says that Vegeta is his favorite character. In 2017, Fox sported Dragon Ball Z inspired Nike shoes in game. In February 2022, Fox was the subject of criticism after he shut down his personal NFT project “SwipaTheFox”, with more than $1.5 million in unpaid investment to approximately 100,000 investors.
