FC Spartak Trnava (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈspartak ˈtr̩naʋa]) is a professional football club based in Trnava, Slovakia. The club competes in Niké Liga, the top division in the Slovak football league system, having participated in more seasons than any other club. Founded in 1923, it is one of the most traditional and successful clubs in the country. It plays its home games at Anton Malatinský Stadium, located in the very centre of the city, and has been based at this location since its inception. The club's anthem is Il Silenzio and it has been played prior to every home match since late 1960s. Domestically, the club has won six league titles and eight cups. The most successful era came on the verge of 1960s and 1970s, when club dominated Czechoslovak football, having won the Czechoslovak First League five times in the span of six seasons. During these times, Spartak Trnava also made its name at the international level, having won Mitropa Cup in 1967 and more importantly, progressing to the semi-finals of European Cup in 1969 and quarter-finals in 1973 and 1974 (the former still standing as the record achievement in the competition for Slovak or Czech club). More recently, the club won the Slovak league title in 2018, as well as Slovak cup in 2019, 2022 and 2023. The club has a large fan-base, having regularly averaged the highest attendance in Slovak football. It has a long-standing rivalry with Slovan Bratislava, with whom it contests a derby. Spartak's colours are red, black and white. Since early days, the home kit consisted of a red and black striped shirt. Spartak's away kit has traditionally been completely white, giving the club its giving the club its nickname bíli andeli (the white angels in local dialect). The club was founded on 30 May 1923 by the merger of Šk Čechie and ČšŠk into TSS Trnava.

A better position came only in the 1959/60 season, when Spartak took 4th place. The Golden era of Spartak began in the 1966–67 season. The team of legendary coach Anton Malatinský was top of the league by the autumn, but by the end of the season had finished only in third place. Great success was achieved in the Mitropa Cup. Spartak beat teams like Budapest Honvéd, Lazio and Fiorentina and in the final they defeated Újpest of Hungary. In the following season Spartak gained their most memorable European results. They reached the semi-final of the European Cup to face Ajax. It is their greatest success to date. 13 April 1969 Olympisch Stadion, Amsterdam Attendance: 55,490 Referee: Eric Jennings (England) 24 April 1969 Spartak Stadium, Trnava Attendance: 22,938 Referee: Ferdinand Marschall (Austria) Ajax won 3–2 on aggregate.

In 1976, Karol Dobiaš was in the squad that won the UEFA Euro 1976. Although Spartak finished 16th (and last) in the last unified Czechoslovak league season in 1992–93, the latter half of the 1990s can be considered the renaissance of football in Trnava. During the 1995–96 season, Spartak finished third and its popularity grew. The 1996–97 season was a memorable one for the fans of Spartak, Karol Pecze almost led the team to its first Slovakian league title but got beaten to it by Košice in the final week of competition.
