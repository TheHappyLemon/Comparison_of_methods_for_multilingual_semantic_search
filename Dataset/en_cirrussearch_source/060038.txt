These are the team rosters of the nations participating in the men's ice hockey tournament of the 2022 Winter Olympics. Team Denmark is the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 30 years and 11 months. Team USA is the youngest, with 25 years and 5 months. Age and clubs listed as of the start of the tournament, 9 February 2022. The Canadian team of 25 athletes was named by Hockey Canada on January 25, 2022. The team consisted of 14 forwards (F), eight on defense (D) and three goaltenders (G). Head coach: Claude Julien Sidney Crosby, Connor McDavid, and Alex Pietrangelo were named to the Canadian roster on October 3, 2021 but did not participate due to the NHL's decision not to send players to the Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The roster was announced on 28 January 2022. Due to the lack of ice hockey talent in China players had to be recruited from abroad. The men's hockey team has eleven Canadians, six Chinese, seven Americans, and a Russian. Neither the Chinese Olympic Committee, International Ice Hockey Federation nor the IOC commented on how it was possible for foreign players to compete for China, as the Olympic Charter requires competitors to be citizens of the country they represent. The IOC Executive Board has the authority to make certain exceptions of a "general or individual nature", though it is unclear whether this was the case. When asked whether he had naturalized as a Chinese citizen, athlete Jake Chelios refused to comment, though he confirmed that he still had his American passport.
