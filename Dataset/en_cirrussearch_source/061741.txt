Dmitry Ilyich Gordon (Ukrainian: Дмитро Ілліч Гордон, romanized: Dmytro Illich Hordon; Russian: Дмитрий Ильич Гордон; born 21 October 1967) is a Ukrainian journalist, interviewer and politician. He is also the editor-in-chief of the newspaper "Boulevard" (from June 1995), later "Gordon Boulevard". In June 2019, Gordon became the head of the election headquarters of the party Strength and Honor. Dmitry was born on the 21st of October 1967 in Kyiv to a Jewish family. His father, Ilya Gordon, was a civil engineer, and his mother, Mina Gordon, was an engineer-economist. Gordon started school at the age of six and finished it at 15. During his school years, he read a lot, was interested in the history of the Revolution, the Civil War and the Eastern Front of the Second World War. He was also keen on theatre, modern music and football. When he was in the fifth grade, he wrote about one hundred letters to famous people asking them to send him their photos with a signature. He got two replies: from Leonid Utyosov and Joseph Kobzon. In 1988, he graduated from Kyiv Civil Engineering Institute. As he recalls, he was very discontent with his choice of study. In his second year he started to collaborate with the leading Kyiv newspapers. During his years of study he published in the best Ukrainian newspapers such as "Vechirniy Kyiv" (literally "Evening Kyiv"), "Komsomolskoye Znamya" (literally "The Banner of Komsomol"), "Molodaya Ukraina" (literally "Young Ukraine"), "Sportivnaya Gazeta" (literally "Sports Newspaper"), "Molodaya Gvardiya" (literally "The Young Guard"), "Prapor Komunizmu" (literally "Banner of Communism"), and "Komsomolskaya Pravda" (literally "Komsomol Truth"). After the graduation Gordon worked for the newspapers "Vechirniy Kyiv", "Kievskiye Vedomosti" (literally "Kyiv Bulletin") and "All-Ukraine Vedomosti" (literally "All-Ukraine Bulletin"). Since 1995, he has been editing his own newspaper, a weekly of society columns "Boulevard" (since 2005 "Gordon Boulevard"). Today in Ukraine "Gordon Boulevard" is one of the most popular newspapers with high circulation. The readers of the weekly count more than 2.5 million people. The newspaper is distributed in Russia, the United States, Israel, Spain, Italy and Germany as well. In June 2019, one month before the July 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Gordon became the head of the election headquarters of the party Strength and Honor. Gordon is the father of seven children. His eldest son, Rostislav (born in 1992), is a student at Kyiv Institute of International Relations. His second son, Dmitry, (born in 1995), is a four-time European champion in the "united combat" discipline in the youth age group. He is also a composer of instrumental music and he plays the piano. Since 2012, he is a student of Berklee College of Music in Boston. Elizaveta (born in 1999) and Lev (born in 2001) are schoolchildren. Gordon's wife is Alesia Batsman – the editor of "Shuster Live". With Alesia, they have three daughters: Santa (2012), Alice (2016), Liana (2019). Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in May 2022, a criminal case was opened by the Russian Investigative Committee against Dmitry Gordon, despite him not being a Russian citizen. Russian authorities accused Gordon of dissemination of fake information about the Russian army. Gordon continues taking a stand against Russia throughout its war, proactively fundraizing for the Ukraininan military as well as supporting Ukraine during media appearances.[citation needed] Dmitry combines his job in the newspaper “Gordon Boulevard” with the publishing of his own books.
