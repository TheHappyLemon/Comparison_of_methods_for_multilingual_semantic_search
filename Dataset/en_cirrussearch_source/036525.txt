Smilers is an Estonian rock band formed in 1991 by Hendrik Sal-Saller. The name reportedly originated from a Rod Stewart album, Smiler. The band was first named Lezer Brozers.[citation needed] In the early years Smilers produced two albums in Finland, but as these were not successful, they returned to Estonia and gained fame soon after. Smilers won the Artist of the Year award in the 2004 Estonian Music Awards. Smilers were also awarded a Golden Disc for Song of the Year in 2004 for "Ainult unustamiseks".
