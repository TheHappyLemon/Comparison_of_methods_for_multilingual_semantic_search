Wolfsburg earned their first promotion to the DEL in 2004. However, after one season, they were relegated back to 2.Bundesliga due to their arena not meeting league standards. In 2006, Eis Arena Wolfsburg opened, allowing the club to return to the DEL, where they have remained since. The 2010–11 season marked the first time the club advanced to the league championship series, but they were swept by Eisbären Berlin.
