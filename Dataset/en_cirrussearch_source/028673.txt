Hvannadalshnjúkur (pronounced [ˈkʰvanːaˌtalsˌn̥juːkʏr̥, ˈxʷa-]) or Hvannadalshnúkur Icelandic pronunciation: [-ˌn̥uːkʏr̥] is a pyramidal peak on the northwestern rim of the summit crater of the Öræfajökull volcano in Vatnajökull National Park, Iceland. Its summit is the highest point in the country. An official measurement completed in August 2005 established the height of the mountain as 2,109.6 metres (6,921 ft 3 in) (previously stated as 2,119 m or 6,952 ft). The peak is part of the Vatnajökull National Park. The route to the top is a popular climb through numerous and frequently hidden crevasses, and, because of this, the climb calls for experienced mountain guides.
