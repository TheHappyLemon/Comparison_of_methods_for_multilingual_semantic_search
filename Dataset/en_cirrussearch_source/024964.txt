Іrmino (Ukrainian: Ірміно) is a city in Kadiivka Municipality, Luhansk Oblast (region) of Ukraine. Irmino is located 55 km west of Luhansk. It is part of the agglomeration Alchevsk-Kadiivka, in Donbas. It is located on the banks of the river Luhan. The population is 9,270 (2022 estimate), 10,044 (2013 est.). Since the War in Donbas began in 2014, Irmino has been under the control of the Luhansk People's Republic. Following the 2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine, the Luhansk People's Republic became a federal subject of Russia. Irmino was the first village of Petrovka/Petrivka (in Ukrainian: Петрівка) founded in 1808 on the right bank of the Luhan by peasants from the Poltava region and renamed Irminka in 1898, or Irmino (Ірміно) around 1910, after the coal mine named after Irma, daughter of the mine owner. In 1936, the village achieved city status and took on the name Teplohirsk in 1977. On July 8, 2010 the town was renamed Irmino. It was in Irmino, at the “Tsentralna-Irmino” mine, where Alexei Stakhanov had been working since 1927, that the legendary miner reportedly managed to extract 102 t (100 long tons; 112 short tons) of coal, i.e. 14 times the norm, on the night of August 30 to August 31, 1935. At the time, the village of Irmino depended on Kadiivka, and Stakhanov's registration would have been made at the Tsentralna-Irmino mine in Kadiivka. 1808 — 1900 — Petrovka (Petrovka), 1900— 1962 — Brother (Irmino), 1977 — 2010 — Teplohirsk (Теплогірсь) 1923 - 2,794 1926 - 5,276 1939 - 15,327 1959 - 21,512 1979 - 19,090 1989 - 18,549 2001 - 13,053 2012 - 10,200 2013 - 10,044 2014 - 9,886 2015 - 9,764 2016 - 9,687 2021 - 9,343 Irmino is 116 km from Luhansk by rail and 75 km by road.
