The Derwitzer Glider was a glider that was developed by Otto Lilienthal, so named because it was tested near Derwitz [de; it] (nowadays part of Werder (Havel)) in Brandenburg. When flown in 1891, it became a very early successful design able to carry a person and one of the first successful manned aircraft in the world. He made flights of up to 25 metres (80 feet) in it.
