The Donets Ridge is a highland that is the highest north-eastern part of the Donets upland. The ridge is in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts of Ukraine and partially in the Rostov Oblast of Russia. The highest point on the ridge is a hill — Mohyla Mechetna, 367 m (1,204 ft). Another hill, Savur-Mohyla (278 m (912 ft)), was a notable site in the War in Donbass.[citation needed] The name derives from the river Seversky (Siversky) Donets. "Donets Ridge".
