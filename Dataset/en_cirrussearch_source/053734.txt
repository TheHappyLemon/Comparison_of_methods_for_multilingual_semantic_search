Vladimir Iosifovich Levenshtein (Russian: Влади́мир Ио́сифович Левенште́йн, IPA: [vlɐˈdʲimʲɪr ɨˈosʲɪfəvʲɪtɕ lʲɪvʲɪnˈʂtʲejn] ; 20 May 1935 – 6 September 2017) was a Russian and Soviet scientist who did research in information theory, error-correcting codes, and combinatorial design. Among other contributions, he is known for the Levenshtein distance and a Levenshtein algorithm, which he developed in 1965. He graduated from the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Moscow State University in 1958 and worked at the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics in Moscow ever since. He was a fellow of the IEEE Information Theory Society. He received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal in 2006, for "contributions to the theory of error-correcting codes and information theory, including the Levenshtein distance". Levenshtein graduated from Moscow State University in 1958, where he studied in the faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics. After graduation he worked at the M.V Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics. Levenshtein, V. I.
