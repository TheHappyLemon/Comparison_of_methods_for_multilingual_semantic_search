Copper Mountain (a Club Med Experience) (also known as just Copper Mountain) is a 1983 Canadian comedy television film, written and directed by Damian Lee and David Mitchell, produced for CTV Television Network, that premiered on First Choice TV network. Starring Jim Carrey and Alan Thicke, it is a "thinly-veiled" quasi-commercial for the now-defunct Club Med ski resort in Copper Mountain, Colorado. The majority of the runtime consists of rom-com plot interspersed with performances by country and rock and roll musicians, Ronnie Hawkins, Rita Coolidge and Chicago frontman Bill Champlin, with whom TV theme song writer Thicke co-wrote the song "Sara". Two friends, Bobby Todd (Carrey) and Jackson Reach (Thicke), travel from their hometown of Grimsby to the Club Med village in Copper Mountain. Jackson intends to hit the ski slopes and compete in a ProAm, while Bobby comically struggles to connect to women, with impressions and routines. Eventually, Jackson wins a ProAm challenge race, and Bobby finds companionship by being himself.
