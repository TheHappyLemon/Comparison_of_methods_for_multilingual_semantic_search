Brian Molko (born 10 December 1972) is a musician who is the lead vocalist, guitarist, and lyricist of the band Placebo. He is known in particular for his nasal vocals, feminine/androgynous appearance and aggressive guitar style and tunings. Molko was born in Brussels, Belgium, to an American Jewish father of French and Italian heritage and a Scottish mother. He had an older brother named Stuart who died in August 2022 after a short illness. Molko's family moved frequently during his childhood due to his father's career as a banker; the family lived in Dundee in Scotland, Liberia, Lebanon, the village of Longeau in Belgium, before eventually settling in the town of Sandweiler, in Luxembourg. Although Molko was brought up in a strict household that disapproved of artistic expression (his father wanted him to become a banker), he rebelled by assuming an androgynous image, wearing nail polish, lipstick, and eyeliner, and listening to punk music. He initially attended the European School of Luxembourg (ESL), but left because he was bullied. He completed his secondary education at the American International School of Luxembourg (AISL), before studying drama at Goldsmiths College in London. Although Molko and Placebo co-founder Stefan Olsdal had both attended the American International School of Luxembourg (AISL), they had not been friends. When Molko was living in London, he ran into Olsdal at South Kensington tube station and invited him to one of his gigs he played with Steve Hewitt in a group called Ashtray Heart. Along with Hewitt and Olsdal, Molko had a role in the 1998 film Velvet Goldmine, for which Placebo performed the T. Rex song "20th Century Boy". He played Malcolm, a singer of the fictional glam rock band, "The Flaming Creatures", who resembled the early Alice Cooper band. During Placebo's live performances Molko has played a number of instruments, including guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, harmonica and saxophone. Molko is openly bisexual, a theme that is reflected in some of his earlier lyrics with Placebo. Molko was previously in a relationship with Helena Berg, with whom he has a son, Cody Molko, who was born in 2005. Cody is now an actor, and appeared in the television series The Drowning. Molko has been open about his use of recreational drugs: in a 1997 interview with Kerrang! magazine he admitted that heroin was "probably the only drug on this planet I haven't tried". However, he later admitted to using heroin as well. Pharmaceutical drugs are also referenced, as evidenced by the band's name as well as the album Meds and its title track. Molko admitted in 2003 that many of his initial excesses were due to his mental health issues; he was officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder in his late twenties. He claimed in 2016 that he gave up drugs completely after the recording and release of Meds. Molko is bilingual, and speaks fluent French and English. In December 2012 Molko received an Honorary Fellowship from Goldsmiths College, University of London. In March 2021, Molko was featured in the Marc Jacobs "Heaven" collection with a campaign shot taken by Harley Weir. In August 2023, Prime Minister of Italy, Giorgia Meloni sued Molko for defamation after he called her a "fascist racist" while performing at the Sonic Park Festival in Stupinigi in July. He has performed, as a guest vocalist and with other artists on Placebo's records, on tracks by: The Cure – "If Only Tonight We Could Sleep" (live) Justin Warfield – "Spite & Malice" Losers – "Summertime Rolls" Asia Argento – "Je T'aime, Moi Non Plus" (Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin cover) Alison Mosshart from The Kills – "Meds" Michael Stipe of R.E.M. – "Broken Promise" Faultline & Françoise Hardy – "Requiem for a Jerk" (Serge Gainsbourg cover) Timo Maas – "Pictures", "Like Siamese", "First Day", "College 84" Kristeen Young – "No Other God" on X Dream City Film Club – "Some", "Billy Chic" Jane Birkin – "Smile" T.

Molko was friends with David Bowie; Bowie sang on Placebo's "Without You I'm Nothing" and on the "20th Century Boy" cover live. Molko uses a variety of guitars.
