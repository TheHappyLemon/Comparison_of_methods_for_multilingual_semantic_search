Designed by Populous and Beijing Institute of Architectural Design, construction began in mid-2017, and was completed in 2019. First competition was held on October 8, 2021. It has an area of 12,000 square meters, being the largest speed skating venue in Asia. The facade is highlighted by 22 "ice ribbon" with a length of 622 meters each.

CO2 is used as both refrigerant in cooling system and secondary refrigerant in cooling distribution system, including the rink pipes. The arena has been completed with a heat recovery function, that can cover arena heating demands like ventilation, air dehumidification, hot water production, etc. The refrigeration CO2 rack, including cooling machines, has 4 MW max cooling capacity.
