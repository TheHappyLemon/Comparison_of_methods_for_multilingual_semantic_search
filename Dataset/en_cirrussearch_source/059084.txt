Bullock's transgender sister, Mia Henderson, was murdered in Baltimore on July 16, 2014. A suspect was arrested in August 2015. In August 2016, Bullock said of his sister, "She lived as herself, she taught me how to be (myself). She taught me how to take care of the family... She was happy with being who she was. She wasn't worried about how others felt about her. A person that can isolate the whole world out and not care about other people's feelings is a strong person, to me. That was one of the biggest things that I got from her."
