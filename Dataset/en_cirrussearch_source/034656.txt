At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Vespasian and Titus (or, less frequently, year 825 Ab urbe condita). The denomination AD 72 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
