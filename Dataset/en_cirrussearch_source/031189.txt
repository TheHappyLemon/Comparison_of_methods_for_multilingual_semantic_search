Logroño (Spanish: [loˈɣɾoɲo] ) is the capital of the autonomous community of La Rioja, Spain. Located in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, primarily in the right (South) bank of the Ebro River, Logroño has historically been a place of passage, such as the Camino de Santiago. Its borders were disputed between the Iberian kingdoms of Castille, Navarre and Aragon during the Middle Ages. The population of the city in 2021 was 150,808 while the metropolitan area included nearly 200,000 inhabitants. The city is a centre of trade of Rioja wine, for which the area is noted, and manufacturing of wood, metal and textile products. The origin of this toponym is, as for many other places, unknown. The name Lucronio was first used in a document from 965 where García Sánchez I of Pamplona donated the so-called place to the Monastery of San Millán. In the Fuero of Logroño from 1095 it appeared under the name Logronio, except once when it was called illo Gronio. The most broadly accepted theses seem to be those which indicate it is a late latinization by prefixing the article "lo/illo" to the old toponym Gronio/Gronno, a word of Celtic origin which means the ford or the pass.[citation needed] It is believed that this name was due to the frequent use of this place to cross the Ebro river. Other historians have proposed alternative theories, such as a possible derivation from Lucus Brun or Lucus Beronius ("Sacred place in the Beronian forest"), but its etymology remains unknown. John II of Castile granted it the title of "City" on 7 February 1431 in Palencia and ratified it on 20 February in Valladolid, thus it stopped being called "Village", despite there being no explicit justification of the reasons for that change. 20 July 1444 the same king added the titles of "Very noble", Spanish: Muy Noble, and "Very loyal", Spanish: Muy Leal, which up until today appear in the seal of the city. In this case, the reason was the loyalty of the habitants against the homonymous king John II of Aragon, because despite the «long war, and wounds and deaths, and robberies, and fires, and damages and oppresions», the city remained loyal to the service of the king of Castile. 5 July 1523, the king Francis I granted it the three fleurs-de-lis for the shield of the city for its resistance during the French siege in 1521. It also received by Royal Decree the title of "Excellence" 6 December 1854 from Isabella II, as a reward for its behavior during the cholera epidemic which devastated the city. Logroño is located in the northern region of La Rioja, on the river Ebro, 384 metres (1,260 feet) above sea level. The Camino de Santiago passes through the city. The geographical coordinates of the city are: 42° 27′ N, 2° 29′ W. The city lies 152 km (94 mi) from Bilbao, 172 km (107 mi) from Zaragoza, 336 km (209 mi) from Madrid and 468 km (291 mi) from Barcelona. Logroño was an old settlement, first of the Romans, under the name of Vareia, a commercial port, and then of the Celts.[dubious – discuss] From the 10th century, possession of Logroño was disputed between the kings of Navarre and those of Castile; the region was finally annexed to Castile. The name is a combination of le and Groin, mashed together as Logroño over time. Alfonso VI of Castile granted Logroño in 1095 a charter of rights that served as a model for other Spanish cities. In 1609 and 1610 Logroño was the main seat of the Basque witch trials, part of the Spanish Inquisition. Famous people from Logroño include Manuel Bretón de los Herreros, Fausto Elhúyar, Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, Rafael Azcona, Ramón Castroviejo, Pedro J. Ramírez, Navarrete "El Mudo".

However, the weather station has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSk) with subtropical influences. The average annual temperature is 13.9 °C (57 °F).
