The Lego Movie is an American media franchise based on Lego construction toys. It began with the 2014 film The Lego Movie, which was directed and written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. The success of the film led to the release of two licensed video games, a 4D film theme park attraction, two spin-off films titled The Lego Batman Movie and The Lego Ninjago Movie, which were released in 2017, Unikitty! an animated television series that also came out in the same year, and the sequel to the original film titled The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part in 2019. Plans for a third spin-off film and a sequel to The Lego Batman Movie were later shelved. The franchise has received a generally positive critical reception, with the exception of The Lego Ninjago Movie which received mixed reviews, and has grossed $1 billion at the worldwide box office. While Warner Bros. still owned the rights to their run of the franchise from 2014 to 2020, including the Unikitty! animated television series, Universal Pictures bought the rights to make plans for an upcoming Lego Movie as part of a 5-year deal following the termination of Warner Bros.' film rights with Lego at the end of 2019. All four films in the franchise were produced as a collaboration between Warner Animation Group (later known as Warner Bros. Pictures Animation), Vertigo Entertainment, Rideback (formerly Lin Pictures), and The Lego Group, with animation provided by Animal Logic. All four films were distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Of note, RatPac-Dune Entertainment (currently Access Industries) only had involvement with the first three films; Village Roadshow Pictures only had involvement financing the first movie; Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's production company, Lord Miller Productions, did not produce the first movie; and only two movies were released in IMAX, The Lego Batman Movie and The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. The Lego Ninjago Movie was originally planned for an IMAX release, but these showings were cancelled. The film was released theatrically on February 7, 2014, through Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures to near-unanimous acclaim; critics praised its visual style, humor, voice cast and heartwarming message. It earned more than $257 million in the U.S. and Canada and $210 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of over $469 million. The film won the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film, the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature, and the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film. It was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. The film also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for "Everything Is Awesome". In October 2014, Warner Bros. scheduled the release of The Lego Batman Movie, a spin-off starring Batman, for 2017, moving the release date for The Lego Movie 2 (later titled as The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part) to 2018. Will Arnett returned to voice Batman, with Chris McKay, who was earlier attached to the sequel, directing the film, the story written by Seth Grahame-Smith, and the film produced by Dan Lin, Roy Lee, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. On April 20, 2015, Warner Bros. scheduled The Lego Batman Movie for a February 10, 2017 release. In July 2015, Arnett's Arrested Development co-star Michael Cera was cast to voice Robin. In August 2015, Zach Galifianakis entered final negotiations to voice the Joker. In October 2015, Rosario Dawson was cast to voice Barbara Gordon, the daughter of police commissioner James Gordon who later becomes the crime-fighting heroine Batgirl. The following month, Ralph Fiennes was cast as Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne's butler. Mariah Carey, although initial reports indicated she was playing Commissioner Gordon, was actually cast as Mayor McCaskill. The score was composed by Lorne Balfe. The first trailer for the film was released on March 24, 2016, followed by a second on March 28 the same year. The film was released in the United States on February 10, 2017. Brothers Dan and Kevin Hageman, who wrote Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu and co-wrote the story of The Lego Movie, co-wrote the film adaptation of Lego Ninjago, which features a new take that diverges from the TV series. Charlie Bean, who produced Disney's Tron: Uprising, directed the film, produced by The Lego Movie team of Dan Lin, Roy Lee, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.[31] The spin-off movie was scheduled to be released on September 23, 2016.[32] On April 20, 2015, the film was delayed until September 22, 2017, as Storks took over the original release date of the movie.[12] In June 2016, the cast was announced to include Jackie Chan, Dave Franco, Michael Peña, Abbi Jacobson, Kumail Nanjiani, Zach Woods and Fred Armisen respectively. It is the second and last spin-off film of The Lego Movie franchise to be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Before the critical acclaim and blockbuster success of The Lego Movie, talks for a sequel were already in motion. On February 3, 2014, Jared Stern and Michelle Morgan were tasked to write a screenplay. On February 21, 2014, the studio scheduled the sequel for a May 26, 2017, release. On March 12, 2014, Deadline reported that the first film's animation co-director Chris McKay would direct the sequel with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller as producers. Warner Bros. did not invite co-producer of the first film, Village Roadshow Pictures, to return as a participant in the sequel, due to Warner Bros. having now more confidence in the film and trying to keep as much profit as possible for itself. On April 10, 2014, McKay expressed that he would like to introduce more women in the sequel than men. On July 28, 2014, it was reported that on the internet, Chris Pratt expressed interest in reprising his role as Emmet for the sequel. It was also reported that Will Arnett might return as Batman, but had not decided yet.[citation needed] In October 2014, Warner Bros. scheduled The Lego Batman Movie for 2017, and The Lego Movie 2 for 2018. By October 25, 2014, Lord and Miller had signed on to write The Lego Movie 2. The writers implied that the sequel would take place four years after the events of The Lego Movie. In February 2015, Warner Bros. announced that the title of the sequel had been changed to The Lego Movie Sequel, and that Rob Schrab, co-writer of Monster House replaced McKay as director since McKay went to direct The Lego Batman Movie. According to an interview at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, the sequel would focus on Emmet and his sister, taking place in a "weird, dystopian version of Bricksburg." On April 20, 2015, Warner Bros. scheduled The Lego Movie Sequel for a May 18, 2018 release date. On June 17, 2016, the film's release was delayed until February 8, 2019. By July 2016, Raphael Bob-Waksberg had been hired to do rewrites of the script. By February 2017, Schrab had been replaced by Mike Mitchell, reportedly due to "creative differences". On September 6, 2017, it was announced that production of The Lego Movie Sequel would begin in Canada on October 2, 2017. It was also announced that Lord and Miller returned to re-rewrite the script to tackle gender issues on how a girl plays versus how a boy plays. On March 23, 2018, it was confirmed that Tiffany Haddish was cast in the film as a new lead character while returning actors would be Pratt as Master Builder Emmet Brickowski, and addition to reprise the role of Emmet, Pratt would also voice the antagonist, Rex Dangervest. Elizabeth Banks reprises her role as Wyldstyle, and Arnett returns to reprise Batman, Channing Tatum as Superman & Jonah Hill as Green Lantern. On May 21, 2018, Warner Bros. officially renamed the film The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part along with releasing the first teaser poster. It is the last film of The Lego Movie franchise to be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, as Universal Pictures subsequently became the distributor of the franchise's future films through 2024. In March 2015, Warner Bros. announced that a third Lego Movie spin-off, titled The Billion Brick Race, was in development. By July 2016, Jason Segel and Drew Pearce signed onto the project as co-directors and co-writers. In August 2017, it was announced that Jorge R. Gutierrez was hired to replace them as its sole writer and director. At that time, the film was scheduled to be released on May 24, 2019 (The day Aladdin was released). By February 2018, Gutierrez had left the project declaring it a failure. In July 2018, the film's plot was announced by Pearce to be a Lego racing movie, inspired by pre-existing racing films, including The Cannonball Run. In December 2019, concept art of the film's main characters was revealed by the film's initial director Jorge R. Gutierrez, along with the confirmation that he had permanently cancelled the project. The poor box office results of The Lego Ninjago Movie and The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, along with the film's lengthy conceptual phase, were given as the primary reasons. In July 2022, Gutierrez stated on Twitter that he intended for the film's two leads to be voiced by Diego Luna and Emma Stone. The film was also going to include elements of time travel as well as an appearance by the creator of Lego, Ole Kirk Kristiansen. In December 2018, Chris McKay confirmed that a sequel to The Lego Batman Movie was in development, with him returning to direct. The film was set for a release in 2022. However, while the rights of DC Comics are owned by Warner Bros., the sequel was cancelled due to Warner Bros. losing the Lego film rights after The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part underperformed at the box office, with Universal signing a deal as the distributors for future Lego films. In June 2021, McKay revealed that the script was being written by Michael Waldron and Dan Harmon, and was stated to have taken notes from The Godfather Part II as well as Boogie Nights. The film would have focused on Batman's relationship with the Justice League, particularly Superman, and the main antagonists would have been Lex Luthor and OMAC. The film was tentatively titled Lego Superfriends. In December 2019, Universal Pictures entered early negotiations to distribute upcoming feature film properties based on the Lego toys. Although Universal will develop and distribute future Lego films, the original Lego Movie characters and films are still owned by Warner Bros. In April 2020, the deal with Universal was set for a limited 5-year film deal with Warner Bros. still owning the previous films. On August 5, 2022, in a podcast interview with The Ankler, Dan Lin revealed that a new Lego Movie film in the series is in development, saying "We know we have to switch it up and take to a different art form that's still true to LEGO." Lin promised that the creative team had "reinvented" the LEGO world for the film, but it does not yet have a release date. By July 2023, it was announced that Aaron and Adam Nee were attached to direct the film. In May 2017, Warner Bros. and Lego announced that Unikitty, a character from The Lego Movie, would get a spin-off television series on Cartoon Network. For the show, she is voiced by Tara Strong. The premiere date was January 1, 2018 and the show's executive producers are Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, Dan Lin, Roy Lee, Jill Wilfert and Sam Register. Ed Skudder (creator of Dick Figures) and Lynn Wang (character designer on Star vs. the Forces of Evil) are signed as producers while Aaron Horvath serves as supervising producer. The series aired a Halloween special/sneak peek titled "Spoooooky Game" on October 27, 2017. The series aired a second sneak peek "Sparkle Matter Matters" on November 17, 2017, and a third and final sneak peek/Christmas special titled "No Day Like Snow Day" aired December 1, 2017. On August 27, 2020, the series concluded with a two-part finale titled "The Birthday To End All Birthdays". Short films set within the franchise were produced. Most of which were released on the home media releases of the films. In addition, various other shorts made to promote the films and unrelated real world events have been released on YouTube.

The whole film is a reference to Lego Ninjago. The Master is a 2016 computer-animated short film written and directed by Jon Saunders, co-written by Ross Evans, Carey Yost and Remington D. Donovan and produced by Ryan Halprin. The short film was released theatrically with Storks on September 23, 2016, as well as early showings of The Lego Batman Movie in the United Kingdom.

In the short, Emmet and the citizens of Apocalypseburg throw a big Christmas Party to make everything awesome again despite the concern of attack from the Systar System from Lucy. Although originally released as an online short, it was eventually included as a bonus feature on The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part's home media release. Two additional shorts for theatrical distribution were in production alongside The Master in 2016: Contagious directed by Patrick Osbourne, and Emmet Amuck directed by Jon Saunders and Ross Evans.
