Kim Kirchen (born 3 July 1978 in Luxembourg City) is a Luxembourgian former road racing cyclist. He is the son of cyclist Erny Kirchen and the great-nephew of cyclist Jeng Kirchen. Kirchen signed as a professional cyclist in 2000 with De Nardi-Pasta Montegrappa, and went on to join Fassa Bortolo in 2001. For the 2006 cycling season, he joined the T-Mobile Team following the demise of the Fassa Bortolo team. His first recorded race was in Dommeldange in 1999, and he had to wait until 2000 for his first professional victory when he won the Piva Col trophy. Kirchen was named the Luxembourgian Sportsman of the Year in 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2008, surpassing the achievement of fellow cyclist Charly Gaul and putting him fourth in the all-time stakes. In July 2008 he showed good form during the Tour de France, placing 7th in the general classification and wearing the yellow jersey for a total of four stages. In 2010, Kirchen joined Team Katusha, after he was unable to agree with Team Columbia–HTC on a contract extension. He suffered a suspected heart attack during the 2010 Tour de Suisse, in June 2010. He did not race in 2011 because of the heart condition and later retired from the sport. Since 2011, Kirchen co-commentates all cycling races broadcast on RTL Télé Lëtzebuerg, along with former Cofidis cyclist Tom Flammang. 1999 1st Road race, National Road Championahips 2001 1st Stage 3 Tour de Luxembourg 2002 1st Overall Ronde van Nederland 1st Overall Tour de Berne 2003 1st Paris–Brussels 4th Overall Tour de Suisse 2004 1st Road race, National Road Championahips 1st Stage Tour de Luxembourg 6th Road race, Olympic Games 2005 1st Overall Tour de Pologne 1st Points classification 1st Stage 7 1st Gran Premio di Chiasso 1st Trofeo Laigueglia 1st Stage 4 Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 2nd La Flèche Wallonne 2nd Coppa Placci 2006 1st Road race, National Road Championahips 1st Prologue Tour de Luxembourg 2007 2nd Overall Tour de Suisse 2nd Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 3rd Overall Tour de Pologne 3rd Brabantse Pijl 3rd Milano–Torino 7th Overall Tour de France 1st Stage 15 2008 1st Time trial, National Road Championahips 1st La Flèche Wallonne Tour of the Basque Country 1st Stages 2 & 4 1st Stage 6 Tour de Suisse 7th Overall Tour de France 1st Stage 4 Held after Stages 6–9 Held after Stages 6–7 & 9 2009 1st Time trial, National Road Championahips 1st Stage 7 Tour de Suisse Cavendish, Mark (June 2009).
