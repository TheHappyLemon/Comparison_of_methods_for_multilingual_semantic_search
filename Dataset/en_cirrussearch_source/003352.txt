The Slovenia men's national basketball team (Slovene: Slovenska košarkarska reprezentanca) represents Slovenia in international basketball competitions, and is managed by the Basketball Federation of Slovenia. Since the independence of Slovenia in 1991, the national team has competed at every EuroBasket, and reached the knockout stage at every championship since 2005. Their greatest achievement overall at the tournament came at EuroBasket 2017, where they won all nine games and became European champions. As of September 2023, Slovenia is ranked 11th in the FIBA World Ranking. Before Slovenia's independence in 1991, Slovenian players represented Yugoslavia. Slovenia joined the International Basketball Federation in 1992 and played its first official game on 22 June 1992 against Bulgaria in the qualification rounds for the 1992 Summer Olympics. Slovenia debuted at the FIBA Basketball World Cup in 2006 after qualifying as the sixth-placed team of the EuroBasket 2005. In the 2010, 2014 and 2023 editions, Slovenia reached the quarter-finals; their highest overall finish is seventh place, achieved in 2014 and 2023. Between May and June 1993, Slovenia competed in the qualifiers for the EuroBasket 1993, where the team won all seven games and therefore qualified for its first EuroBasket. At the main tournament, held in Germany, Slovenia finished in 14th place out of 16 teams with one win and two defeats. Slovenia did not reach the knockout stages of the competition until the 2005 edition, where the team, coached by Aleš Pipan, reached the quarter-finals for the first time. In 2009, Slovenia reached the semi-finals for the first time after eliminating Croatia in the quarter-finals with a 67–65 victory. In the semi-finals, Slovenia lost to Serbia after overtime, and later to Greece in the third place game, finishing the competition in fourth place. In the next two tournaments, in 2011 and 2013, Slovenia was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Spain and France, respectively. In 2015, Slovenia failed to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since the 2003 edition after losing to Latvia in the round of 16. At EuroBasket 2017, Slovenia, captained by Goran Dragić and managed by Igor Kokoškov, won the championship after winning nine consecutive games, including victories against the 2013 winners France and the 2015 winners Spain. Dragić, who scored 35 points in the final against Serbia, was named the most valuable player of the tournament. Slovenia qualified for the men's basketball tournament at the 2020 Summer Olympics after competing in the 2020 FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments, winning the tournament in Kaunas. They won all games in the Group B, defeating Poland and Angola. In the Final round, they defeated Venezuela 98–70, and qualified for the final against Lithuania. Slovenia defeated Lithuania 96–85 in Kaunas, led by Luka Dončić (31 points, 11 rebounds, 13 assists), who with his triple-double sent Slovenia to their first Olympic appearance. Dončić was also proclaimed as the MVP of the tournament. At the Olympics, Slovenia was drawn in the group with the host Japan, Argentina, and reigning world champion Spain. In the opening game, they beat Argentina 118–100. With his 48 points in this game, Dončić tied with Eddie Palubinskas for the second highest points scored in a match in the history of the Olympics. In the next game Slovenia defeated host Japan 116–81. In the final match of the group stage, Slovenia faced Spain, the reigning world champions, and beat them 95–87. Mike Tobey, who was named player of the day by FIBA, recorded a double-double with 16 points and 14 rebounds, while Klemen Prepelič scored the crucial three-pointer that put Slovenia ahead 86–85 two and a half minutes before the end. The win gave them the group's top seed, and they were set to face Germany in the quarter-finals. Slovenia won their quarter-final, defeating Germany 94–70. Slovenia then lost the dramatic semi-final against France by one point, 90–89. In the last seconds of the game, Nicolas Batum blocked Prepelič's layup attempt, thus preventing Slovenia from reaching the final. In the bronze medal game, Slovenia played against Australia, and lost 107–93. Slovenia finished their inaugural Olympic tournament in fourth place, and Dončić was selected in the All-Star Team of the tournament.
