In the middle of these letters, there is the figure of Yivli Minare which is one of the several symbols of the city of Antalya. Three rectangular shapes on the Yivli Minare represent the unity of the three teams of Antalya. Antalya's first stadium was Antalya Atatürk Stadium which fell into disrepair from 2009 onwards. That forced the team to relocate to Akdeniz University Stadium which holds 7,083 spectators. In 2013 Antalyaspor began construction of Antalya Stadium. This stadium, which opened in the summer of 2015, seating 33,032 spectators, is nicknamed 100. Yıl (Centenary), after the major boulevard of the same name, 100. Yıl Bulvarı", which is located directly south of the stadium.[citation needed] 1.
