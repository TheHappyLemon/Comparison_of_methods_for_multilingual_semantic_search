In 1923, the ethnic Korean student group in Tokyo, ‚Ä≥Saekdong-hoe‚Ä≥ (ÏÉâÎèôÌöå), proclaimed the first Children's Day on May Day, later on 7 May.

In 1954, the United Nations established Universal Children's Day dedicated to improving children's welfare worldwide. It is celebrated annually on 20 November. Besides, many countries have their own national holidays to celebrate children. For example, Children's Day in Myanmar (former Burma) is celebrated on 13 February. The date of Myanmar's Children's Day coincides with the birthday of Aung San, a Burmese revolutionary, politician and general who is considered the Father of the Nation in present-day Myanmar. He fought for Burma's independence from Japan and the United Kingdom. It was decided to celebrate Aung San's birthday as Children's Day because "he fought for a better future for Burmese children". In the late 1980s, a military dictatorship was established in Myanmar. Naturally, the military government didn't encourage the celebration of Aung San's birthday and, by extension, Children's Day. The situation began to change after the 2011‚Äì2012 democratic reforms. Today, Children's Day is officially celebrated in schools across Myanmar. On 13 February, Burmese schools host special events for students. Their main goal is to emphasize the importance of education for the future of Burmese children, as well as to raise awareness of the problems that children and their parents face on a daily basis.

The first Children's Day was celebrated in Tantoyuca, Veracruz on 8 May (year unknown), but in 1925 President √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n changed it after the country joined the Geneva Conventions and looking after the wellness of the vulnerable children affected by World War I. Later, the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child was adopted on 26 November 1924 by the League of Nations recognizing that children are the most affected by war events. United Nations recommended 20 November to celebrate Children's Day throughout the world, but that day coincides with Revolution Day (Mexico). Also, 30 April was selected to avoid 1 May (Labor Day) and the celebrations of Cinco de Mayo (The Day of the Battle of Puebla). In Nicaragua the International Children's Day is celebrated on 1 June. In Panama, Children's Day or Kid's Day was formerly held on 1 November, but was changed by Vivian Fernandez de Torrijos, the wife of President Martin Torrijos (2004‚Äì2009), to the third Sunday of July.

Children's Day observations in the United States predate both Mother's and Father's Day, though a permanent annual single Children's Day observation is not made at the national level. National Children's Day is generally celebrated in June or October, but other days are celebrated as well. National Children's Day was celebrated on the second Sunday of October under the Bush and Clinton administration starting on 8 October 1989. The only exception was in 1993 when it switched to 21 November. In 2001, Congress declared that National Child's Day is to be celebrated on the first Sunday of June, which the Bush administration followed except in 2002, when it was postponed to the second Sunday of June. The Obama administration continued to celebrate "National Child's Day", but switched the date to 20 November, which does not always fall on a Sunday. An exception was made in 2009, when it was celebrated on Sunday, 22 November. In 1996, author Pat Mora, after learning about the annual Mexican tradition of celebrating 30 April as El d√≠a del ni√±o, the Day of the Child, proposed an annual celebration in the U.S. of El d√≠a de los ni√±os, El d√≠a de los libros/Children's Day, Book Day, thus honoring children and connecting them to literacy, essential in a democracy. Assistance starting this community-based, family literacy initiative was provided by REFORMA, the National Association to Promote Library & Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish Speaking. Often known as D√≠a, because it is both a daily commitment and an annual April celebration, Children's Day, Book Day, has grown to link all children to books, languages, and cultures. A major partner is the Association for Library Services to Children (ALSC), a division of the American Library Association (ALA). Every year, across the country, hundreds of libraries, schools, and community organizations, etc. hold culminating April Children's Day, Book Day celebrations that unite communities, creating an annual tradition much like Mother's Day and Father's Day. On 23 April 2011, Executive of King County, WA declared 23 April as the International Children's Day. Children's Day celebrations of Turkish Community in California lead to the State of California recognizing the last Saturday of April as the Children's Day. In 1856, Rev. Charles H. Leonard, D.D., then pastor of the First Universalist Church of Chelsea, Mass., set apart a Sunday for the dedication of children to the Christian life, and for the re-dedication of parents and guardians to bringing-up their children in Christian nurture. This service was first observed the second Sunday in June. The Universalist Convention at Baltimore in September 1867, passed a resolution commending churches to set apart one Sunday in each year as Children's Day. The Methodist Episcopal Church at the Methodist Conference of 1868 recommended that second Sunday in June be annually observed as Children's Day. The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in 1883 designated "the second Sabbath in June as Children's Day." Also in 1883, the National Council of Congregational Churches and nearly all the state bodies of that denomination in the United States passed resolutions commending the observance of the day. About this time many other denominations adopted similar recommendations. Chase's Calendar of Events cites Children's Sunday and notes that The Commonwealth of Massachusetts issues an annual proclamation for the second Sunday in June. Since 2009, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn has issued proclamations proclaiming the second Sunday in June as Children's Day as had the previous governor in 2007 and 2008. The mayors of Aurora and Batavia, Illinois, also have issued proclamations. Numerous churches and denominations currently observe the second Sunday in June including the African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. Children's Day (in Spanish "D√≠a del Ni√±o") in Argentina it has been historically celebrated on the second Sunday of August, however in 2013 it changed to the third as the second interfered with the country's primary elections. It is usual for kids to get toys and other gift from their parents/families and people usually gather and share meals together. It has been celebrated on this date continuously since the 1960s but it earned meaning in 1990 when around the same date the country adopted the "Children Rights Convention" under the law N¬∞ 23.849. Children's day in Bolivia was first established in 1954. Google made a Google Doodle celebrating this holiday on 13 April 2019. Although the holiday is celebrated on 12 April, not the 13th. In Brazil, Children's Day (In Portuguese: Dia das Crian√ßas) is celebrated on 12 October, coinciding with Our Lady of Aparecida's day, the country's Patron Saint holiday. In Brazil, Children's Day is celebrated by kids receiving presents from their parents and relatives. In Chile, Children's Day is officially recognized and assigned to the first Wednesday of October. However, it is observed on the second Sunday of August. It retains none of the international flavors as a day to recognize the needs of or rights of children but is observed merely as a commercial holiday dedicated to buying toys for children. In Colombia, Children's Day is celebrated on the last Saturday of April. It was established as a holiday in 2001. In Ecuador, Children's Day (D√≠a del Ni√±o) is celebrated on 1 June. Generally, kids up to 12 years old receive presents. In Paraguay, Children's Day is celebrated on 16 August, day of the Battle of Acosta √ëu, where it is said that 20,000 men from the Triple Alliance were awaited by a Paraguayan force made up of 3,500 children ages six to fifteen, ordered to hold the Alliance forces while the president Solano Lopez could escape. Even though Paraguay had been already completely defeated, it is said that Lopez forced them to stay and face the enemy, others sources claim that the children volunteered to fight against the Allied forces after their families had been killed by the advancing allied forces (see more in Paraguayan War). Children's Day is a national holiday, used to remember the event, which happened during the five-year war.[citation needed] According to Peruvian law in Peru, Children's Day (D√≠a del Ni√±o Peruano (Ley N¬∫ 27666) , literally Peruvian Child's Day (Law N¬∫ 27666)) is celebrated every second Sunday of April. There is a second celebration every third Sunday of August promoted as the "International Children's Day". On this day of the year, Peruvian children would typically be congratulated and would receive presents from their parents. Since it is celebrated on Sunday, all special activities in school, such as field trips and the like are done the previous Friday. All major stores offer special discounts on toys, appliances, electronics, clothes, etc. In Suriname, Children's Day or Kinderdag is celebrated on 5 December. Generally, children up to 12 years old receive presents from their parents. Children's Day in Uruguay is the second Sunday in August. 6 January is Epiphany (Reyes), also celebrated as Children's day. In Venezuela, Children's Day is celebrated the third Sunday of July.[citation needed] Children's Week is an annual event celebrated in Australia during the fourth week in October, from the Saturday before Universal Children's Day to the following Sunday. Prior to 1977, Child Care Week was held in various Australian states and territories focusing on children in care or those in institutions. This event was held at different times throughout the year. In 1984, it was decided to coordinate a national week to include all children to align with Universal Children's Day. In 1996 it was decided to adopt a permanent theme, "A Caring World Shares", to celebrate the right of children to enjoy childhood. Organised events allow children to demonstrate their talents, skills and abilities. National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children's Day in Australia has been held each year, since 1988, on 4 August. This event was initially held against the backdrop of bicentennial year protests that obscured the importance of indigenous children. The 4 August had historically been the date Stolen Generation Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who had been separated from their families without knowledge of their true birth dates would celebrate their birthday. Today, the day brings Elders, families and their children together to celebrate the strengths of First Nation's children and learn about the crucial impact that culture, family and community play in the life of every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child. In New Zealand, Children's Day is typically celebrated on the first Sunday in March. It honors children as a taonga (Maori for treasure), and is a day family can relax and share in activities to honor their children. In 2012, the focus was on peace and aroha (Maori for 'love'). New Zealand has high rates of child abuse and family violence. The New Zealand Government has recognized this as one of the most important issues for New Zealanders, with an event such as Children's Day helping to focus on the practice of sharing, loving and caring as well as honoring tamariki (Maori for 'children').[citation needed] The first Monday in August is National Children's Day in Tuvalu. This public holiday is called in Tuvalu Aso Tamaliki. In Vanuatu, Children's Day is celebrated on 24 July. The two main themes of the holiday are "Stop violence against children" and "Give a child the chance to express their opinion today". After the march, there are speeches and activities organized by schools, including a dance. Then, after midday, children return home to spend time with their parents for the rest of the day. Children's Day is a public holiday, set up following a recommendation of the committee on the Rights of the Child. A group of people in the United Nations monitor and protect children's rights. A committee, with both adult and child members, organizes activities. In the past, a committee of adults has chosen the theme ‚Äì but in the future children may help choose it. Children's Day originally took place only in the capital of Vanuatu, but it has now been extended to all 6 provinces. Schools, churches, local governments of the provinces and other local organizations all organize activities. Save the Children supports one Children's Day activity in each province, selecting it from the many requests they receive for support. In 2008, one of the activities supported by Save the Children was a sports day between many different schools. Parents and caretakers have been supportive of Children's Day activities. Many parents come to activities with children. In one province, children and parents from five different schools came together for a shared lunch. Some parents give their children presents for Children's Day ‚Äì however, Save the Children try to spread the message that it doesn't matter if a parent can't afford to buy their child a present, as the real aim of Children's Day is for parents and children to spend the day together, and work together to reconcile their problems.
