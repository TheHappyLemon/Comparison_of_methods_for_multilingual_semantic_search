Mandaue (Tagalog pronunciation: [mɐnˈdaʊ.ɛ]), officially the City of Mandaue (Cebuano: Dakbayan sa Mandaue; Hiligaynon: Dakbanwa sang Mandaue; Filipino: Lungsod ng Mandaue), is a 1st class highly urbanized city in the Central Visayas region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 364,116 people. Mandaue City is located on the central-eastern coastal region of Cebu. Its southeast coast borders Mactan Island where Lapu-Lapu City is located and is connected to the island via two bridges: the Mactan-Mandaue Bridge and Marcelo Fernan Bridge. Mandaue City is bounded on the north by the town of Consolacion, to the east by the Camotes Sea, and to the west and south by Cebu City. It is one of three highly urbanized cities on Cebu island and forms a part of the Cebu Metropolitan area and was part of the sixth district of Cebu joined with the municipalities of Consolacion and Cordova - it was qualified for a lone district since 1991. In April 5, 2019, the city became a lone legislative district. As of June 30, 2022, Mandaue City had its first representation in the 19th Congress of the Philippines. A community was established in Mandaue by a flourishing group of Austronesian people. The Venetian chronicler Antonio Pigafetta wrote of a settlement called "Mandaui" which existed in the area with a chieftain named Apanoaan some called him Lambuzzan in other accounts. Mandaue natives were forced into a town as decreed by the Spanish authorities. This may have started off as a mission village (which included present day Consolacion, Liloan and Poro) serving as a bulwark for the church in the northern Cebu and was managed by the Jesuit in 1638 then a century later by the Recollects. The Philippine Revolution of 1898 gave the town a new form of administration in accordance with the organic decree of the Central Revolutionary Government. The short-lived revolution was overthrown by the American troops and a battle nearly destroyed the town in 1901, killing Presidente Benito Ceniza. Mandaue was a semi-autonomous functioning town. Semi-autonomous as it was still under the jurisdiction of Cebu. Despite having been developed and organized by the Spaniards throughout the ages and its population increasing as the years gone by, the Spaniards did not make an initiative to elevate the town into an independent municipality. It was only after the death of Presidente Ceniza and the establishment of American Rule in Mandaue that the dream of becoming an independent municipality came true. In 1901, Mandaue became an independent municipality. Mandaue became independent from being an American Commonwealth and a Japanese garrison on July 4, 1946, along with the entire nation. On August 30, 1969, Mandaue became a chartered city and decades later it was recognized as a highly urbanized city on February 15, 1991.
