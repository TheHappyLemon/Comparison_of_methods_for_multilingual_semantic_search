"Tears" is a song by English electronic group Clean Bandit, featuring English singer Louisa Johnson. It was released on 27 May 2016. It is the last single to feature Neil Amin-Smith as violinist after his departure. Clean Bandit and Johnson performed the song with 5 After Midnight during the finals of The X Factor on 10 December 2016. It was included on the deluxe edition of the band's second studio album, What Is Love? Jack Patterson said: "Tears is an epic trap-2step breakup ballad. I wrote it with Sam Romans at the piano, and over the course of a year, it has transformed from a simple piano tune into a mad beast of changing time signatures and feels. To me, Tears feels like a 1990s vision of a future breakup song." The music video features Johnson and the band in a room with burning instruments with water on the floor. The video also features a snowy owl that was one of several who had previously played Hedwig in the Harry Potter films. Daw, Robbie (27 May 2016).
