Christophe Jérôme Dugarry (born 24 March 1972) is a French former professional footballer who played as a forward. His clubs include Bordeaux, Milan, Barcelona, Marseille, Birmingham City and Qatar SC. He was also a member of the France team that won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. Dugarry came through the youth ranks at Bordeaux alongside future France teammates Bixente Lizarazu and Zinedine Zidane. He spent eight years at Bordeaux, scoring 34 goals in 187 appearances. His two goals against A.C. Milan in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup quarter-finals helped to seal a move to that club for the 1996–97 season.[citation needed] Dugarry managed just 5 goals in 27 appearances for Milan, before joining Barcelona the following season. After only seven appearances in his sole season there, he returned to France, first with Marseille. He then returned to Bordeaux, where he played another 65 games, scoring 9 goals.[citation needed] In 2003, he joined Birmingham City on loan as the second World Cup-winner to join the team, the first being Argentinian Alberto Tarantini in 1978. His prominence earned him rough treatment from opposition defenders. After a run of 5 goals in 4 matches cemented the club's Premier League status, moving them from the relegation zone to 13th, Dugarry joined the club on a permanent two-year deal in May 2003. He saw out less than the first season, scoring once in 15 appearances before leaving the club by mutual consent, citing family reasons. He then signed a one-year contract with Qatar SC, where he made no appearances. Following this, he retired from football in 2005.[citation needed] He has since been inducted into Birmingham City's Hall of Fame. Dugarry made his international debut in a 1–0 win against Australia on 26 May 1994. He was capped 55 times for the France national team and scored eight goals. With France, Dugarry won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2000 and the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup. He also played at UEFA Euro 1996 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup.
