eToro is a social trading and multi-asset investment company that focuses on providing financial services. Its headquarters are located in Central Israel, and the company has registered offices in Cyprus, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. eToro was founded as RetailFX in 2007 in Tel Aviv, by brothers Yoni Assia and Ronen Assia together with David Ring. In 2010, the firm released the eToro OpenBook social investment platform, along with its CopyTrader feature, that enables investors to copy the network's top traders automatically. Later that year, the firm released an Android app. Between 2007 and 2013, the company raised $31.5 million in four rounds of funding. In December 2014, it raised $27 million from Russian and Chinese investors. In December 2017, it joined CoinDash to develop Blockchain-based social trading. In 2018, it raised a further $100 million in a private funding round. Overall, more than $162 million has been invested in the company by investment firms. In 2013, the firm introduced the capability to invest in stocks and CFDs, alongside commodities and currencies, with an initial offering of 110 stock products (which later grew to 3000 financial products). The same year, it was authorized to offer services in the UK, under the subsidiary eToro UK. In January 2014, the firm added cryptocurrencies to its investment instruments. In March 2019, eToro acquired Danish blockchain company Firmo for an undisclosed sum. In October 2019, eToro released a sentiment-based crypto portfolio using AI technology to evaluate Twitter's current positive or negative impressions of digital assets. In November 2019, the firm acquired Delta, a crypto portfolio tracker application company, based in Belgium. In March 2019, the company launched its cryptocurrency trading platform and its standalone cryptocurrency wallet to US users. In 2021, the company reported operating in 140 countries and having 20 million users. In March 2021, it announced that it is planning to become a publicly traded company through a reverse subsidiary merger with FinTech Acquisition Corp V (NASDAQ:FTCV), a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) backed by former Bancorp CEO Betsy Z. Cohen. The combined company will operate as eToro Group Ltd and have an implied estimated enterprise value of $10.4 billion at closing with $650 million in funding coming from private investment in public equity (PIPE) from Softbank Vision Fund 2, Third Point, Fidelity Management, Wellington Management, ION Investment Group and Research Co. In 2020, the company acquired Marq Millions, the UK division of e-money, which was then renamed to eToro Money. The company also obtained a primary membership of Visa and an electronic money institution (EMI) license from the Financial Conduct Authority. In December 2021, the company launched the eToro Money debit card for UK residents. In February 2022, eToro released its first Super Bowl ad during Super Bowl LVI, also nicknamed as "Crypto Bowl”. Called “Flying your way”, the 30-seconds commercial featured a consumer seeking cryptocurrency advice and crypto enthusiasts falling from the sky to offer him guidance and assistance, asking “to the moon?” The advertisement also featured a Shiba Inu dog addressing meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bored Ape. In August 2022, eToro signed a definitive agreement to acquire Gatsby, a fintech startup specializing in options and stock trading, for $50 million in cash and common equity. In September 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India's central bank, released a list of 34 forex trading online platforms, in which eToro was also listed as an illegal platform in India. eToro's main research and development office is located in Tel Aviv, Israel. Its other legal entities are registered in the UK, US, Australia and Cyprus. The firm is regulated by the CySEC authority in the EU; it is authorized by the FCA in the UK, and by FinCEN in the United States, and by the ASIC in Australia. In 2013, it was fined €50.000 by CySEC due to detected weaknesses which concerned its organisation and operation structure back to 2010. In 2015, eToro was added to Quebec blacklist as an unauthorized foreign company that encouraged residents to invest in binary options via its trading platform. The company operates in 140 countries. In August 2018, eToro announced a sponsorship deal with seven UK Premier League teams including Tottenham Hotspur, Brighton & Hove Albion F.C., Cardiff City F.C., Crystal Palace F.C., Leicester City F.C., Newcastle United F.C., and Southampton F.C. On Thursday 13 Apr 2023, Twitter announced a partnership with eToro that would give users the option to buy and sell stocks and other assets from eToro, the company told CNBC exclusively. On March 2, 2022, eToro triggered a stop-loss closure of investor positions in Magnit stock (MGNTL.L) at $0.01 per share. On March 7 2022, eToro reimbursed clients for the total initial invested amounts of MGNTL.L. On January 8, 2021, eToro notified its European clients that "due to extreme market volatility in the crypto markets, margin positions for all leveraged crypto positions" should be changed to nonleveraged, or they would be closed within four hours.
