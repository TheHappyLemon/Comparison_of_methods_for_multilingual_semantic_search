It is native to Europe and western Asia. The geographical distribution of the native range includes the British Isles, northern Europe, largely avoiding the Mediterranean, and north-western Asia. It also occurs in the Caucasus. Stace, C. A. (2010). New Flora of the British Isles (Third ed.). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 9780521707725.
