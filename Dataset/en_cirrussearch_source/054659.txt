João Pessoa (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʒuˈɐ̃w peˈsoɐ]), a port city in northeastern Brazil, is the state of Paraíba's capital and largest city, with an estimated population of 833,932 (as of 2022). It is located on the right bank of the Paraíba do Norte river. The new "Estação Ciência, Cultura e Artes" (Science, Culture and Art Station), located at the most eastern point of the Americas (Ponta do Seixas), is an educational and cultural institution as well as a national landmark. The complex, inaugurated in 2008, was created by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and is one of his final projects. The capital of Paraíba received the title of Creative City by UNESCO in 2017, appointing João Pessoa as "Brazilian city of handicrafts". City name throughout history 1585–1588 Royal City of Our Lady of the Snows 1588-1654 Philipeia of Our Lady of the Snows 1630–1654 Fredrikstad (Frederick City) 1654–1930 Parahyba do Norte 1930–present João Pessoa The city of João Pessoa was founded on August 5, 1585, during the celebration of the peace pact between the Portuguese represented by the Portuguese João Tavares, and the indigenous people, represented by the Piragibe Indian, chief of the Tabajara, on the banks of the Paraíba River. The French inhabited the locality, and had an alliance with the indigenous tribe of Potiguaras. With the alliance of the Portuguese with the Tabajaras (rivals of the Potiguaras), the Portuguese colonists, led by Frutuoso Barbosa, finally managed to expel the french and conquer Paraíba. After the conquest, they built the forts of São Tiago and São Felipe. They brought masons, carpenters, engineers and others to build the City of Nossa Senhora das Neves. With the beginning of the works, they went to Baía da Traição to expel the rest of the french who remained in Paraíba. There was the nomination of João Tavares to be the captain of the Fort. The Royal City of Nossa Senhora das Neves was the third city to be founded in Brazil, with the signing of an agreement between João Tavares and the chief Piragibe of the Tabajaras. Called "Royal City of Our Lady of the Snows", in honor of the saint of the day it was founded, its first structures were on the banks of the Sanhauá River, a tributary of the Paraíba River, now known as Porto do Varadouro, in the neighborhood of the same name. In 1588, the city was renamed "Philipeia of Our Lady of the Snows", in honor of King Philip II, who at the time accumulated the thrones of Spain and Portugal. In 1634, attracted by the sugar wealth of the then-capital of the Paraíba, the Dutch invaded and named it Fredrikstad (Frederick City), in honor of the prince of Orange, Frederick of Orange, was one of the two main cities of New Holland, brought the town a period of great prosperity, the installation of mills on the coast enabled greater efficiency in sugar production, with the main consequence being the guarantee of large profits, but, on the other hand, it required the practice of monoculture that was developed in increasing extensions of land, the latifundia. After the decline of New Holland and with the departure of the Dutch, the city was again dominated by the Portuguese and acquired the name "Parahyba do Norte" in 1654. The city was renamed João Pessoa in September 1930 in memory of the former governor of Paraíba, João Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque, who had been a vice-presidential candidate and was murdered on 26 July that year. João Pessoa is the third oldest city in Brazil. João Pessoa has 20 kilometres (12 mi) of beachfront. João Pessoa has many green areas distributed among its avenues, parks, and residential neighborhoods, supporting its claim as "the second greenest city in the world" with more than 7 square kilometres (2.7 sq mi) of forested land, second only to Paris. This claim is a matter of conjecture, however, originating from a publicity stunt carried out by the city's mayor during an Earth Summit. In João Pessoa, there are about twelve rivers. The Jaguaribe River is born in the Esplanada complex, crosses the Benjamim Maranhão Botanical Garden, in the middle of the Atlantic Forest, and flows into the Atlantic Ocean on the border with the municipality of Cabedelo. The water to supply the houses is taken from the Gramame-Mumbaba system, from the Paraíba Water and Sewerage Company. In this system, these two rivers take turns to supply the city with water. However, the most historically important river is the Sanhauá River, because it was on its banks that city was born and where the first houses were built. There is also the Solón de Lucena Park Lagoon in the City Center. The lagoon was the main tourist spot in the city during the time when most of the city was far from the beaches. At the end of 2010, during the Christmas celebrations, the lagoon was revitalized and gained devices such as ambient music. The capital of Paraíba has a coastline of about 24 kilometers in length, nine beaches in the municipality alone, in addition to the beaches of the Metropolitan Region, such as the city of Cabedelo, the city of Lucena and the District of Jacumã in the municipality of Conde , where the Tambaba Naturist Beach is located. Urban beaches are characterized by white sand beaches and crystal clear waters. Many have preserved the Atlantic Forest, as well as being ideal for bathing thanks to a natural barrier about 6 kilometers from the coast that protects a large part of the Pessoa and Cabedelo coast, allowing children to play in the calm waters. There is the Urban Tartarugas Project, which operates on the beaches of Bessa and Intermares, a spawning area for the hawksbill turtle, a scenario for environmental preservation. Surfing is also practiced in the city. Among the main beaches, we can mention the Praia de Tambau, about 8 kilometers long, composed of fine, beaten sand, with blue-green waters; the bessa beach is where the caribessa is located, a quiet beach with crystalline waters; also the Praia de Manaíra, a totally urban beach, formed by coral reefs, which makes its waves weak and clear water in summer. It is the point of several kiosks and bars, with sports fields on its edge. The Cabo Branco beach, white sand and warm water; Playa Seixas, which is where the most eastern point of America is located. In addition to Praia da Penha, where the historic Chapel of Our Lady of Penha, built in 1763, where the penha pilgrimage takes place every year, from the historic center to the beach.; The Jacarape beach, where the Poet Ronaldo Cunha Lima Convention Center is located; then Praia do Sol, which is a quiet and airy place; and the barra de gramame beach, which situates the meeting of the river gramme with the sea. João Pessoa has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen Am) with very warm to hot temperatures all year long and strong rainfall in most of the months; however, October to December have rather low rainfall. The city has a Benjamin Maranhão Botanical Garden, which preserves the Atlantic forest, the animals, and opens the visitation, which is the João Pessoa Botanical Garden, considered one of the largest remains of the natural Atlantic Forest in an urban area of Brazil. It is a excellent opportunity for people to be in contact with pure and crystalline nature. Among these, environmental education is a relevant element, allowing interesting approaches, from knowledge and interest in plants to stimulating curiosity and knowledge of this important space for visitation and research. There are 18 stations distributed along the Rio and Preguiça trails using as criteria elements mainly related to history, botany and ecology, contributing to knowledge of the environment and the need for its preservation.The area has about 515ha, of which 343ha are home to the Botanical Garden, where the flora is not very soft in the recreational and educational activities promoted on the spot. It includes the largest natural urban Atlantic forest reserve in the country, and an important historical heritage of the capital of Paraiba.
