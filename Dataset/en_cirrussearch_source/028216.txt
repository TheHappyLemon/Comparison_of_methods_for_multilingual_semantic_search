Slavičín (Czech pronunciation: [ˈslavɪtʃiːn]) is a town in Zlín District in the Zlín Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 6,200 inhabitants. Villages of Divnice, Hrádek na Vlárské dráze and Nevšová are administrative parts of Slavičín. There are several theories about the origin of the name. The name could be derived from slavík (i.e. 'nightingale'), or there may be a connection with the Slavník dynasty. According to local legend, the name is derived from slavný čin (meaning 'glorious deed'). Slavičín is located about 24 kilometres (15 mi) southeast of Zlín. It lies in the Vizovice Highlands, on the Říka stream. The highest point is at 532 m (1,745 ft) above sea level. The first written mention of Slavičín is in a deed of Bishop Jindřich Zdík from 1141. For centuries, it was mostly an agricultural village where the craft did not flourish much. In 1860 a tannery was founded here, which was later expanded by a shoe factory. In 1936, an engineering company was established and Slavičín became an industrial village. After the World War II Slavičín further expanded, and in 1964 it became a town. The Church of Saint Adalbert is the oldest building in the town. The original church was from the 13th century. After it was destroyed by a fire, this cemetery church completely rebuilt in the Baroque style in 1897. The Slavičín Castle was built in the Baroque style in 1750. Today it serves as a restaurant.
