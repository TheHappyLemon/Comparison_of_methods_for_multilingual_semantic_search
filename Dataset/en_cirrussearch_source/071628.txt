Luxembourg is a canton in the south of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Its name, like the name of the Grand Duchy itself, derives from the name of its principal city, Luxembourg (more commonly known as Luxembourg City). It is not to be confused with the former district of Luxembourg, one of three administrative units in Luxembourg abolished in October 2015. It is the only canton, other than Mersch, that is entirely surrounded by other cantons and, therefore, has no international boundary. Luxembourg Canton consists of the following eleven communes: Bertrange Contern Hesperange Luxembourg Niederanven Sandweiler Schuttrange Steinsel Strassen Walferdange Weiler-la-Tour On 26 March 1920 the former communes of Hamm, Hollerich and Rollingergrund (all from Luxembourg Canton) were merged into the commune of Luxembourg. On 1 July 1920 the former commune of Eich (from Luxembourg Canton) was merged into the commune of Luxembourg. (in French)/"Mémorial A, 1920, No. 23" (PDF) (in German). Service central de législation.
