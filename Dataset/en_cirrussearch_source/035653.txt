On June 7, the Warriors set two NBA Finals records during a 118–113 Game 3 win over the Cavaliers: most three-point field goals made in a quarter (9 in the first quarter) and in a half (12 in the first half).

On June 9, the Cavaliers defeated the Warriors 137–116 in Game 4 of the NBA Finals, snapping the Warriors' record playoff winning streak at 15 games. Several NBA Finals records were broken during the game. The Cavaliers set NBA Finals records for most points in a quarter (49 in the first quarter) and in a half (86 in the first half) in addition to most made three-pointers in a half (13 in the first half, which broke the record set by Golden State in the first half of Game 3 of this year's Finals only two days earlier) and in a game (24 total, which broke the record set by Golden State in Game 2 of this year's Finals only five days earlier). The Cavaliers and Warriors also scored a combined 154 points during the first half, setting an NBA Finals record for most combined points in a half.
