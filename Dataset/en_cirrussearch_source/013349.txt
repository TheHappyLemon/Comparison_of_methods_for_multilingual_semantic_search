Kristaps Juris Keggi (August 9, 1934 – July 4, 2023) was a Latvian-American orthopedic surgeon. He was considered to be the pioneer of the anterior approach to total hip replacement. Keggi was the recipient of multiple national and international awards and four Honorary Doctorates. Kristaps Keggi was born in Riga, Latvia on August 9, 1934, in the family of surgeon Jānis Kegi. His grandfather was a folklorist, teacher and pastor Ludis Bērziņš (1870–1965). During World War II, he fled with his family to Germany in 1944, and moved to the United States in 1949. He studied medicine at Yale University (1951-1959) and was a resident at the Roosevelt Hospital in New York and at Yale-New Haven Hospital. From 1965 to 1966 he participated in the Vietnam War as a military doctor. Keggi was stationed with the 173rd Airborne as Chief of Surgery at the 3rd Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in Biên Hòa, Vietnam. In 1966, he joined Yale University as an assistant professor. In 1989, he became a clinical professor of orthopaedics and rehabilitation at Yale University. In 2008, he was elected full professor in the Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation at Yale, and in 2010 he was named Elihu Professor of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation. Keggi served as senior research scientist at the Yale School of Medicine and as the director of Yale-New Haven Hospital's Joint Replacement Center and of Waterbury Hospital's Orthopaedic Center for Joint Reconstruction. Keggi practiced orthopaedic surgery at both St. Mary's Hospital (1969-1989) and Waterbury Hospital (1969-2018). From 1987, he regularly visited Latvia, where he performed demonstration operations, conducted seminars, and gave lectures. In 1988, he founded the non-profit Keggi Orthopaedic Foundation to allow for formal academic exchanges between the United States and the USSR. The organization has provided fellowships in advanced orthopaedic surgery at the Yale School of Medicine and at Waterbury Hospital for more than 300 surgeons from the Baltic nations, Russia, and Vietnam. In 1990, he founded the memorial museum of his grandfather Luda Bērziņš in Jūrmala. He established the "Keggi Velo," a bike race in memory of his father. He was the founder of the Luda Bērziņš Prize. Keggi's daughters were successful in sports. Mara Keggi participated in the 1988 Summer Olympics in rowing competitions, while Caroline Keggi participated in LPGA Tour golf tournaments. Keggi died on July 4, 2023, at the age of 88. Keggi studied major joint replacement, spinal diseases and wound treatment.
