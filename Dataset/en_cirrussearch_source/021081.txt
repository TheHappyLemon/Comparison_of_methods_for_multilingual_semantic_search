100,000 (one hundred thousand) is the natural number following 99,999 and preceding 100,001. In scientific notation, it is written as 105. In Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and South Asia, one hundred thousand is called a lakh, and is written as 1,00,000. The Thai, Lao, Khmer and Vietnamese languages also have separate words for this number: แสน, ແສນ, សែន (all saen), and ức respectively. The Malagasy word is hetsy. In Cyrillic numerals, it is known as the legion (легион): or .
