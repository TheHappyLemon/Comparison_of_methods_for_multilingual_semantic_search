Russula rosea (synonym Russula lepida), known as the rosy russula, is a north temperate, commonly found mushroom of the large "brittlegill" genus Russula. The cap is convex when young, later flat, mostly bright cinnabar to carmine red; often with yellow spots and up to 10Â cm in diameter. The gills are pale straw-yellow, brittle, and occasionally with a red edge at the rim of the cap. The spores are pale-cream. The stem is usually flushed carmine, but can be pure white. The flesh is hard and bitter-tasting; some consider it edible, others inedible. This mushroom is commonly found in coniferous forests[citation needed] or near beech trees. The rare Russula pseudointegra is distinguished by its hot-tasting flesh. Red-stemmed forms of R. rosea could also be confused with Russula xerampelina, but the latter has softer flesh and no woody flavour. List of Russula species Russula rosea Pers. - Rosy Brittlegill E.
