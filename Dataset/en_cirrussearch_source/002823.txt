Room for Improvement is the debut mixtape by Canadian rapper and singer Drake. It was self-released on February 14, 2006, by All Things Fresh.

In February 2006, in an interview with thabiz.com, Drake talked about the mixtape, "It's a mix CD and I did it with DJ Smallz, who does the Southern Smoke Series. He's done mixtapes with everyone. Lil Wayne, Young Jeezy, a lot of people and he's hosting it for me. It's called Room for Improvement. It's seventeen original tracks and a couple of remixes and stuff like that. 22 tracks in total. I have the Clipse on there, I got Trey Songz in there, I got Lupe Fiasco on there, I have Nickelus F, who is this amazing artist from Virginia, who I'm very very tight with and we work together a lot, we worked together. I have Voyce on there, he's a singer from Toronto. Production wise I don't really have any major producers on there. I have a song I did with Trey Songz. I have an individual by the name of Nick Rashur from Harlem he's a really cool cat. Amir; Boi-1da did the majority of the singles, who else should I mention DJ Ra from DC, a lot of people on the CD." The mixtape was re-released in 2009, featuring only 11 selected songs, with no DJs along with a remix of 'Do What You Do'. Partial credits adapted from Drake's personal notebook.
