Uldis Augulis (born 16 March 1972) is a Latvian politician and a member of the Union of Greens and Farmers. He holds a bachelor's degree in financial management from the University of Latvia. He was the former Welfare Minister from 2009 to 2010 and again between 2014 and 2016, and also again since 2023. He was also the former Minister of Transport from 2010 to 2011 and again between 2016 and 2019. He was also the acting Minister of Justice from March to April 2010. Augulis was elected to the Saeima on October 2, 2011. Augulis caused controversy with his prioritisation of road and rail links between Riga and Moscow while delaying regional EU projects such as Rail Baltica citing a lack of funds. Latvia has already lost EUR 12.2 million (LVL 8.54 million) of EU funds due to hesitation over the Rail Baltica project, and the EU Transport Commissioner has stated there is no chance that the EU will contribute funds to the proposed Moscow link despite Augulis' assertion that the EU could contribute up to 85%. The high-speed railroad project between Riga and Moscow is economically justified due to increasing passenger and cargo turnover, and it is not political, Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said after a meeting with Augulis.
