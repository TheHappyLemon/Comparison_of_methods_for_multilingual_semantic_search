"You Belong with Me" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift and the third single from her second studio album, Fearless (2008). Big Machine Records released the song to radio on April 20, 2009. Swift was inspired to write "You Belong with Me" after overhearing a phone call between a touring band member and his girlfriend; she and Liz Rose wrote the lyrics depicting an unrequited love. Swift and Nathan Chapman produced the track, which features a banjo-led country pop production and incorporates fiddle, mandolin, and rock-influenced bass and electric guitars. Although the single was promoted to country radio, some critics categorized it into 1980s pop subgenres such as pop rock and power pop. Early reviews generally praised the radio-friendly production and emotional engagement of the lyrics, although a few deemed the songwriting formulaic. Although some feminist critics took issue with the lyrics as slut-shaming, retrospective opinions have considered "You Belong with Me" one of Swift's signature songs. At the 2010 Grammy Awards, the song was nominated in three categories, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year. The single reached the top 10 on charts and received certifications in Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand. In the United States, it peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the first country song to reach number one on both the Hot Country Songs chart and the all-genre Radio Songs chart. The single was certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Roman White directed the song's music video, which stars Swift as both the antagonist (an unsympathetic, popular brunette cheerleader) and the protagonist (a sympathetic, blonde girl next door who yearns for the antagonist's boyfriend). At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the rapper Kanye West interrupted Swift's acceptance speech for Best Female Video, which caused a controversy widely covered by the media. Following the 2019 dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she rerecorded the song as "You Belong with Me (Taylor's Version)" for her rerecorded album Fearless (Taylor's Version) (2021). "You Belong with Me" was included on the set lists for five of Swift's six headlining tours as of 2023. Taylor Swift wrote songs for her second studio album, Fearless, while touring as an opening act for other country musicians to promote her self-titled debut studio album during 2007–2008, when she was 17–18 years old. Continuing the romantic themes of her first album, Swift wrote songs about love and personal experiences from the perspective of a teenage girl to ensure her fans could relate to Fearless. The end product was a collection of songs about the challenges of love with prominent high-school and fairy-tale lyrical imagery. Swift and the producer Nathan Chapman recorded over 50 songs for Fearless, and "You Belong with Me" was one of the 13 tracks that made the final cut. Recorded by the engineer Char Carlson, the track was produced by Swift and Chapman, and mixed by Justin Niebank at Blackbird Studios in Nashville. Swift was inspired to write "You Belong with Me" after she overheard a phone call between a band member and his girlfriend. She recalled that he became defensive when his girlfriend confronted him, which made her come up with the opening lines: "You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset. She's going off about something that you said." Out of sympathy for him, she imagined herself as a "girl-next-door-itis" character with hidden feelings for a close male friend, whom she understood but was in a relationship with a popular yet "snobby, ridiculous, overrated girl". She immediately wrote down some lyrics and in a songwriting session with Liz Rose, developed a complete narrative. Swift played the pre-chorus and chorus to Rose and sang the lines, "She wears short skirts/ I wear T-shirts", which were her favorite to write on the song. Rose suggested Swift write "something about bleachers", and they conceived another lyric, "She's cheer captain and I’m on the bleachers." "You Belong with Me" follows a verse–chorus form that has a pre-chorus between the verse and the chorus. The verse and the chorus follow the diatonic I−V−ii−IV chord progression (F♯−C♯−g♯−B), and each chord is maintained for two measures. The pre-chorus, though using the same chords, follows the ii−IV−I−V progression, and each chord is maintained for one measure. The track is set to a medium-tempo 4/4 time signature, and each section is divided into eight-measure phrases. Swift sings with melodic variation: Each section from the verse to the pre-chorus rises in register. Toward the chorus's end, Swift uses melisma on the words "see" and "me" in the lyric "Why can't you see / you belong with me?"—for each of the word, she sings with three notes that descend a short distance (B−A♯) and then a considerable drop (A♯−D♯). The musicologists Nate Sloan and Charlie Harding label this three-note melodic motif the "T-Drop", which recurs on many of Swift's later songs. "You Belong with Me" (Karaoke Version) A sample of the pre-chorus and chorus: the banjo strums and slide guitar riffs in the pre-chorus submerge in the chorus to make room for dynamic electric guitars Problems playing this file? See media help. Reviews from mainstream publications generally called "You Belong with Me" a country pop song, but many critics and musicologists deemed it a pop song applicable to more than one radio format. American Songwriter's Savannah Dantona said that it was "openly a pop song influenced by country, not country influenced by pop". Nolan Gasser said that the country-music stylistic foundation was in the instruments: banjo strums that drive verses, a pedal steel guitar, occasional slide guitar riffs, and a slight twang in Swift's vocals. As the song progresses into the chorus, the banjo and pedal steel submerge to make room for dynamic electric and bass guitars. Jody Rosen categorized "You Belong with Me" as power pop, while Andrew Unterberger of Billboard said that the dynamic shift from the verses to the chorus made the track sound "almost [...] like a '90s rock song". Gasser, Michael Campbell, and James E. Perone cited the song structure, rhythm, and collective use of acoustic, electric, and bass guitars to categorize the song into 1980s styles of pop rock, new wave, and pop-punk. For Perone, this 1980s connection is in the "highly unusual" incorporation of guitars and country banjo, fiddle, and mandolin in the steady eighth-note texture. In "You Belong with Me", a female narrator expresses her feelings for a male friend who is in a relationship with an unappreciative girlfriend. The lyrical motifs evoke a typical American high school setting: The narrator sees herself as a typical girl and an underdog, and the girlfriend is a popular, attractive cheerleader. The narrator appreciates the male friend ("She doesn't get your humor like I do / [...] She'll never know your story like I do"), but he is unaware of her affection. She discusses how she and the girlfriend contrast in the verses ("She wears high heels, I wear sneakers / She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers"). Throughout the song, the narrator persuades the male friend to acknowledge her charm. Some critics found the lyrics rather melancholy despite the upbeat production and opined that contrary to Swift's status as an attractive and popular figure, her narrator's position as an underdog contributed to her reliability. Ken Tucker in NPR wrote that the lyrics and vocals were full of "intense ache" that effectively conveyed adolescent yearning. Gasser described the narrative lyrics as the most profound country influences on "You Belong with Me", while Tom Breihan of Pitchfork found its narrative about unrequited love reminiscent of "the most fragile, heartbroken strains of twee indie pop". In the Edmonton Journal, Amanda Ash thought that the lyrics were not as sentimental since Swift's character "mocks a guy for his choice in women but also sheds a tear for his blindness". Before Fearless was released, Big Machine Records made "You Belong with Me" available for download exclusively via the iTunes Store in November 2008, as part of the promotional campaign "Countdown to Fearless". The track debuted at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100, making Swift tie with the Jonas Brothers for the most top-20 debuts (five) within one calendar year. Big Machine released the song to US country radio on April 20, 2009, as the third single from Fearless. The track was released to US contemporary hit radio on May 18, 2009, by Big Machine in partnership with Republic Records. The single peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 2009. Driven by non-country radio airplay, it gained the largest crossover radio audience since Faith Hill's "Breathe" in 2000. It also holds the record for the highest audience impression for a country song. On the Radio Songs chart, "You Belong with Me" peaked at number one, becoming Swift's first single and the first country song in history to do so since Billboard began incorporating Nielsen BDS-monitored data in 1990. On other airplay charts, it spent two weeks atop Hot Country Songs and 14 weeks atop Adult Contemporary, and it peaked at number two on both Pop Songs and Adult Pop Songs. It was the second-most-played song on US airplay of 2009, behind Fearless's lead single, "Love Story". "You Belong with Me" was certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for seven million units based on sales and streaming and had sold 4.9 million copies in the United States by July 2019. In the United Kingdom, "You Belong with Me" was released as a single on August 24, 2009, under Mercury Records imprint; it peaked at number 30 on the UK Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The single peaked within the top 10 on charts in Canada (three), Australia (five), New Zealand (five), and Japan (10), and it peaked within the top 40 in Ireland (12), Slovakia (17), Hungary (31), and Denmark (32). In Canada, the song reached number one on three airplay charts: Canada Country, Canada CHR/Top 40, and Canada Hot AC. The single was certified platinum in Japan and New Zealand, and multi-platinum in Australia (nine times platinum) and Canada (double platinum). By 2019, the single had sold an estimated seven million copies worldwide. In Fearless album reviews, a multitude of critics considered "You Belong with Me" a standout and recommended it for download. Some lauded the production as catchy and radio-friendly, a quality to which they attributed the single's crossover success—Craig S. Sermon from the Telegram & Gazette described the song as an "irresistible keeper", and Chris Richards from The Washington Post described the incorporation of country banjos and new-wave guitars as "perfectly natural". Critics also complimented how the lyrical sentiments resonated with a broad audience, including not only Swift's core audience of teenage girls but also adults. There were praises that observed a sophistication in the songwriting: Josh Love from The Village Voice picked it as one of the album's great songs for displaying "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness", and Jon P McLaughlin of The Province said that it captured "the nuances and minutiae" of high-school romance. Ash thought that the "witty" song showcased a maturity to Swift's adolescent perspectives, as compared to the "sappy" single "Teardrops on My Guitar" (2006). Some critics were more reserved in their praise: Chris Williams of Billboard contended that the lyrics might come off as immature to some listeners, and Johnny Davis of the British newspaper the Observer commented that the high school imagery "may needle British ears". The Tampa Bay Times complained that the song was generic and too similar to any of Swift's previous singles. After "You Belong with Me" was nominated in three categories at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Slant Magazine's Jonathan Keefe wrote that although it was not Swift's best-written song, it stood out among other contenders because "it's hard to fault its construction". Pitchfork included "You Belong with Me" in their list of the best songs of 2009, at number 69. It ranked 10th on The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop mass critics' poll for the same year. In 2010, "You Belong with Me" received several industry awards and nominations. At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, It was nominated for Song of the Year (lost to Beyoncé's "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"), Record of the Year (lost to Kings of Leon's "Use Somebody"), and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (lost to Beyoncé's "Halo"). The track won Favorite Song at the Kids' Choice Awards and was nominated for Song of the Year (lost to Lady Antebellum's "Need You Now") at the Academy of Country Music Awards. At the BMI Country Awards, organized by Broadcast Music, Inc. to honor the year's most-performed country songs on U.S. radio on television, "You Belong with Me" made Swift the youngest to win Songwriter of the Year and the first to win Song of the Year three consecutive times, after she had won for "Teardrops on My Guitar" in 2008 and "Love Story" in 2009. Critics have considered "You Belong with Me" one of Swift's signature songs and said that its pop-friendly sound preceded her later artistic shift from country to mainstream pop. Nate Jones from Vulture (2023) placed "You Belong with Me" second, after "All Too Well", in his ranking of Swift's discography; he lauded it as a "classic" about high-school feelings and wrote: "The line about short skirts and T-shirts will likely be mentioned in Swift's obituary one day." Chris Willman from Variety (2022) ranked it first in his list; he opined that the lyrical sentiments about adolescent feelings contributed to the song's enduring popularity and lauded the production as "monstrously hooky". Hannah Mylrea of NME (2022) placed it at number 22 out of Swift's 161 songs, and Jane Song from Paste (2020) ranked it eighth out of 158 songs. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone and Alexis Petridis of The Guardian were less enthusiastic; the former ranked it 128th out of Swift's 243 songs, and the latter said that it was somewhat less impactful than "Love Story". "You Belong with Me" appeared on some all-time rankings. It was ranked among the greatest songs of the 2000s decade by CMT (number eight) and VH1 (number 50). Billboard ranked the chorus of "You Belong with Me" the 20th-greatest in "100 Greatest Choruses of the 21st Century" (2017): "There were about a dozen moments ... you could point to as proof that Taylor Swift would one day become the biggest pop star in the world, but maybe none bigger than the immaculate chorus of ['You Belong With Me']." The magazine also featured the track at number 42 on their list of "The 500 Best Pop Songs" (2023) and said that it "[stood] the test of time" thanks to its "memorable lyrical passages" and "nuanced vocal runs". "You Belong with Me" ranked first on Teen Vogue's "91 Best Songs About Unrequited Love" (2020). Some feminist authors deemed "You Belong with Me" antifeminist or slut-shaming, citing the lyrics contrasting Swift's character in T-shirts and the antagonist girlfriend in short skirts as an act of belittling other women to win men's attention. Sady Doyle deemed the song a "triumph of girl-on-girl sexism" that promoted "moral superiority and '50's-style coy submissiveness", and Lauren Michele Jackson regarded it as a "bouncy jaunt through the valley of me versus those other girls". In Vulture, Nate Jones argued that the song, alongside other releases by Swift around the time, was made to appeal to a conservative, red-state audience. In a defense of the song, Emily St. James from Vox thought that the antifeminist interpretations ignored Swift's willingness to "play both women in that dichotomy [good-hearted girls next door [and] cheerleader jezebels]" and the song resonated with many people for its "earnest vulnerability and raw emotionality". Roman White directed the song's music video, in which Swift portrays both the protagonist ("the nerd, who is pining away for this guy that she can't have") and antagonist ("the popular girl, horrible, scary, intimidating and perfect"). The actor Lucas Till, whom Swift had met while on the set of Hannah Montana: The Movie in April 2008, portrays the male lead. In a behind-the-scenes video aired on Great American Country, Swift elaborated on the narrative: The protagonist wishes she could be in the antagonist's position to be with the boy. Filming took place within two days in Gallatin and Hendersonville in Tennessee; the prom and football match scenes were filmed at Pope John Paul II High School, with the school supplying many extras, including students, band members, cheerleaders, and football players. In scenes that feature both the protagonist and the antagonist, Swift used a body double. The two dresses that Swift used for the ending scene are from Jovani. The video starts with Till's character arguing with his girlfriend through a phone call. The protagonist, with big glasses and curly blonde hair, notices, and the two communicate by holding up signs through their adjoining bedroom windows. The boy closes his window, not knowing that the blonde holds up a sign saying, "I love you." The blonde, while in her room, tries on different costumes associated with different high school archetypes and busts out dance moves without knowing that the boy is watching through his window curtain; White replaced Swift's choreographed moves with what she described as "the dumbest moves". The next day, the blonde is sitting on a bench while reading a book as the boy approaches and talks with her. The antagonist, donning straight brunette hair, arrives and kisses the boy in her car as she gives the blonde a hostile look. At a football game, the brunette is a cheerleader and the blonde sits on the bleachers, performing in the school band (played by Swift's touring band). After scoring the winning touchdown, the boy finds his girlfriend flirting with a teammate (played by a friend of Swift's brother Austin), resulting in a heated argument as the blonde witnesses. Back at their bedroom windows, the boy and the blonde again communicate through signs; he asks her if she is going to prom, and she says no. The blonde notices the boy's disappointed look and decides to go to the prom in a white dress without her glasses. The brunette approaches the boy, but he ignores her and goes to the blonde instead. Ending the video, the boy and the blonde reveal folded signs saying "I love you" to each other and kiss. On the video's conclusion, White explained that it is meant to portray "who she really is", and Swift thought it was a happy ending. The video premiered on May 4, 2009, on CMT. Great American Country aired the video two days later and a 30-minute behind-the-scenes titled Taylor Swift on the Set: You Belong with Me later that month. MTV also put it on rotation. Writing for MTV, Tamar Anitai opined that the plot and fashion of "You Belong with Me" alluded to six teen movies of the late 1990s and 2000s: She's All That, Mean Girls, Drumline, Bring It On, A Cinderella Story, and Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist; Chris Ryan said that it had a similar plot to a rom-com and deemed it the most memorable video on MTV of 2009. The video was nominated for Video of the Year (lost to Miranda Lambert's "White Liar") at the 45th Academy of Country Music Awards, Video of the Year (lost to Carrie Underwood's "Cowboy Casanova"), and Female Video of the Year (lost to "White Liar") at the 2010 CMT Music Awards. At the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards in Canada, it was nominated for Best International Artist Video (lost to Miley Cyrus's "Party in the U.S.A.") and the People's Choice: Favourite International Video (lost to Adam Lambert's "Whataya Want from Me"). At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, "You Belong with Me" won Best Female Video. During Swift's acceptance speech, Kanye West came up to the stage to grab Swift's microphone and said, "Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you and I'ma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time", referencing Beyoncé's "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", a nominee in the same category. Known as "Kanyegate", the incident was widely covered by the press and resulted in many Internet memes. Public reaction turned against West; U.S. President Barack Obama called him a "jackass". He later issued an apology, which Swift accepted. Shaun Cullen, an academic in popular culture studies, deemed the incident an example of American "racial melodrama" that stereotyped a cultural rivalry between a violent, hostile black antagonist (West) and an innocent, gracious white victim (Swift). The controversy resonated throughout both West's and Swift's later careers and influenced their music releases such as West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and 2016 single "Famous" and Swift's 2017 album Reputation. Critics have considered "You Belong with Me" an iconic video. Billboard included it in a 2014 list of the "20 Best High School Music Videos". Mary Fogarty and Gina Arnold deemed it a representation of Swift's talents to portray "contradictory [...] performed persona" but still maintain her authenticity and an early example of her cultural status as both "villain and victim" that represented not only ideals of "an America that has passed into history" but also "a feminist future". The "Junior Jewels" T-shirt that Swift's blonde character wears became a memorable look; Glenn Rowley writing for the Recording Academy said that it "established the goofy side of Swift's personality" and her "willingness to embody characters in her videos". Spin (2017) deemed it Swift's second-best video, behind "Blank Space" (2014), and wrote, "This wasn't the last time [Swift] emerged victorious over her supposed bullies (or painted herself as a victim)." During promotion of Fearless in 2009, Swift performed the song on televised shows and events including The Today Show and the CMT Music Awards. She also performed the song for a mini-concert at Bishop Ireton High School after students of that school won a Verizon Wireless contest. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift performed "You Belong with Me"; she first sang the song in a subway station, dressed in a brown trench coat and a black beanie, and continued in a subway ride, taking off the trench coat and revealing a red cocktail dress. Once the subway docked at a stop, Swift completed the performance atop a yellow taxi cab. Billboard in 2022 ranked it as the 14th-greatest VMAs performance of all time. After the VMAs, Swift performed the song again on The View and Saturday Night Live. Swift included "You Belong with Me" in the set lists for the festivals that she headlined in 2009, including the Florida Strawberry Festival, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, and the CMA Music Festival. She also performed it on GMTV in the United Kingdom and at the Sound Relief concert in Australia. "You Belong with Me" was the opening number on the set list of Swift's first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, in 2009–2010. Before the concerts began, the screen showed footage of celebrities including Miley Cyrus, Faith Hill, and Garth Brooks sharing their definitions of the word "fearless". The shows opened with the stage decorated as a school hallway as background videos showed lockers; six background dancers were dressed as cheerleaders and the seven-member backing band wore marching band outfits. Swift appeared at the top of the stage, in a drum majorette uniform, to sing "You Belong with Me". Midway, the dancers removed her marching-band outfit to reveal a sparkling silver cocktail dress and boots. At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards in February 2010, Swift performed a medley of "You Belong with Me", "Today Was a Fairytale", and Fleetwood Mac's "Rhiannon" with Stevie Nicks. Swift first sang "Today Was a Fairytale" on an acoustic guitar, dressed in a white blouse and jean. She then duetted "Rhiannon" with Nicks and played the acoustic guitar again for "You Belong with Me", during which Nicks stood back, tapping her tambourine and nodding and occasionally singing with Swift. For her parts, Swift sang off-key and harmonized poorly with Nicks, which resulted in a media backlash that questioned her vocal abilities. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said it was refreshing to see "see someone so gifted make the occasional flub" and opined that it was necessary for her to have "her facade [...] come undone a bit" as her fame grew bigger. Big Machine's CEO Scott Borchetta defended Swift as "[maybe ...] not the best technical singer, but [...] probably the best emotional singer". "You Belong with Me" was part of the set list of Swift's second and third concert tours, the Speak Now World Tour in 2011–2012 and the Red Tour in 2013–2014. During the shows of the latter tour, she rearranged the song into a 1960s-girl-group-inspired version. The song was part of Swift's performance at BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards and a VH1 Storytellers episode that was recorded at Harvey Mudd College in California; both took place in October 2012. On several shows of the 1989 World Tour (2015), Swift performed an acoustic version of "You Belong with Me" outside the regular set list. She also sang the song at the Formula One United States Grand Prix on October 22, 2016, and at the pre-Super Bowl Super Saturday Night event on February 4, 2017. She included it in a medley with "Style" and "Love Story" in the set list of her Reputation Stadium Tour (2018). On her Eras Tour (2023–2024), which Swift described as an homage to all of her album "eras", she performed "You Belong with Me" as part of the Fearless era. The singer-songwriter and producer Butch Walker recorded a seven-minute video of him recording the instruments and covering "You Belong with Me" onto YouTube in November 2009. In the video, Walker plays drums and tunes a mandolin before singing the song, incorporating lyrics told from a male perspective. The cover was included in a deluxe edition of Walker's 2010 album, I Liked It Better When You Had No Heart. His cover is a banjo-led folk and bluegrass composition. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine described its arrangement as "fantastic" and said that it "emphasized the terrific melody and structure that are the song's real selling points". "You Belong with Me" was parodied by the comedy musician "Weird Al" Yankovic, who titled it "TMZ" and included it in his studio album Alpocalypse (2011). In "TMZ", Yankovic sings about how paparazzi and the titular gossip site publicizes "embarrassing" things of celebrities. Yankovic said that the track did not feature his clear stance whether he supported the paparazzi or the celebrities and instead made fun of "everyone's obsession with celebrity culture and how ridiculous it is and why do we even care about any of this". A music video for "TMZ", directed by Bill Plympton, was filmed in October 2010 and included on the album's DVD. Credits adapted from Fearless album liner notes Taylor Swift – vocals, songwriter, producer Liz Rose – songwriter Nathan Chapman – producer Steve Blackmon – assistant recording engineer, assistant mixer Chad Carslon – recording engineer Justin Niebank – mixer In 2018, Swift ended her 13-year contract with Big Machine and signed anew with Republic Records; in November 2020, she began re-recording her first six studio albums that Big Machine had released. The decision followed a 2019 dispute between Swift and the talent manager Scooter Braun, who acquired Big Machine, including the masters of her albums. By re-recording the albums, Swift had full ownership of the new masters, which enabled her to control the licensing of her songs for commercial use and therefore substituted the Big Machine–owned masters. The re-recording of "You Belong with Me", subtitled "Taylor's Version", was released as part of Fearless's re-recording, Fearless (Taylor's Version). Republic Records released the album on April 9, 2021. One day before the release, the singer-songwriters Olivia Rodrigo and Conan Gray, whom had been contacted by Swift, posted clips of themselves dancing to excerpts of "You Belong with Me (Taylor's Version)" on TikTok. "You Belong with Me (Taylor's Version)" charted on the official singles charts of Australia (53), Canada (44), Ireland (30), Singapore (20), and the United Kingdom (52). It was certified platinum in Australia and silver in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it peaked at number 75 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 16 on Hot Country Songs. The track peaked at number 51 on the Billboard Global 200. Swift produced "You Belong with Me (Taylor's Version)" with Christopher Rowe, who recorded her vocals at Kitty Committee Studio in London. David Payne, assisted by Lowell Reynolds, recorded the track; and John Hanes, assisted by Reynolds and David Garten, engineered it at Black Bird and Prime Recording Studios in Nashville. Musicians included Amos Heller (bass guitar), Mike Meadows (acoustic guitar, banjitar, banjo, mandolin), Paul Sidoti (electric guitar), Matt Billingslea (drums), and Jonathan Yudkin (fiddle). Caitlin Evenson provided background vocals. Serban Ghenea mixed "You Belong with Me (Taylor's Version)" at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach. "You Belong with Me (Taylor's Version)" features an identical arrangement as the original; Alexandra Pollard of The Independent the musical elements were "painstakingly reconstructed". Kitty Empire of The Observer said the re-recording had a "smoother" and more "nuanced" production that was evident through the "interplay between the guitar and banjo", and Lucy Habron of Clash said the more defined instruments made the song "shinier". Critics commented that Swift's vocals were the most prominent change and brought forth a new listening experience. Emily St. James commented that Swift's voice used more of her alto range and therefore made the song sound fuller. She also opined that the storytelling perspective changed over time, calling the new version "warmer and more empathetic". Hannah Mylrea of NME claimed that Swift successfully revisited the teenage feelings "with kindness and affection", and Saloni Gajjar of The A.V. Club said that Swift incorporated a subtle change in delivery that elevated the emotional impact. Joe Coscarelli from the New York Times, meanwhile, thought that the rerecorded track "can't help but sound like [a cover]" because of Swift's matured vocals and teenage lyrics. Heather Taylor-Singh of Exclaim! and Jonathan Bernstein of Rolling Stone opined that Swift's vocals somewhat lost the adolescent sense as in the original.
