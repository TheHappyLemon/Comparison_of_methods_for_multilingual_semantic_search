She was one of the top performers of the romantic Russian Gypsy songs in the late 1920s and 1930s before the genre became almost taboo in Soviet Russia. Yurieva was largely forgotten until the 1990s when she resurfaced on television and was named a People's Artist of Russia. 7452 Izabelyuria, asteroid named after her «Старинные романсы и песни»[permanent dead link] Some sources indicate her birth year as possibly 1902, but her obituary and tombstone both list 1899 "Умерла Изабелла Юрьева".
