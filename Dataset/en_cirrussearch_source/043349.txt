On 26 July 2014, Khalifa was loaned to Club Africain with an option to buy included in the deal. In June 2016 Kalifa was linked with a move to Qatar to play for Al-Shahania Sports Club but this move eventually fell through. He spent time on loan with Kuwait SC in 2018. On 14 January 2019, Emirates Club has signed Khalfia for one seasons from Club Africain.
