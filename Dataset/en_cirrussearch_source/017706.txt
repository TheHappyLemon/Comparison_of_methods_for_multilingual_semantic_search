Davyd-Haradok or David-Gorodok (Belarusian: Давыд-Гарадок, IPA: [daˈvɨd ɣaraˈdok]; Russian: Давид-Городок; Polish: Dawidgródek) is a town in Brest Region, Belarus. As of 2023, it has a population of 5,774. Within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Davyd-Haradok was part of Brest Litovsk Voivodeship. In 1793, Davyd-Haradok was acquired by the Russian Empire in the course of the Second Partition of Poland. The 18 March 1921 Peace of Riga between Poland on one side and Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine on the other defined Davyd-Haradok (Dawidgródek) as part of Poland in the interwar period. It was administratively located in the Polesie Voivodeship. Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the village was occupied by the Soviet Union until 1941. In 1940, more than a third of the total population was Jewish, 4,350 Jews. The town was under German occupation from 7 July 1941 until 9 July 1944. On 10 August 1941, 3,000 Jews older than 14 years old were murdered in a mass execution perpetrated by an Einsatzgruppen unit consisting of Germans and their collaborators. Survivors were imprisoned in a ghetto where they were forced to perform forced labour and suffered harsh living conditions, many deaths. On 10 September 1942, 1,263 remaining inhabitants of the ghetto, the vast majority women and children, were murdered. About a hundred of them managed to escape to the forest.
