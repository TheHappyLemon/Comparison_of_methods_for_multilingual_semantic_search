Minsk-Pasažyrski (Belarusian: Мінск-Пасажырскі, Russian: Минск-Пассажирский) is the main passenger railway station in Minsk, Belarus. It is located in the centre of Minsk. It is sometimes called Minsk Ploshchad Lenina due to the metro station serving the terminal, or simply Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal, Vilnius station (Belarusian: Віленскі вакзал Russian: Виленский вокзал). The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II, Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945–1946 and served until 1991. The new building of Minsk-Passazhyrski railway station was built in 1991–2002. Its construction was delayed for financial difficulties. However, now Minsk has one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. Minsk Passazhirsky is the hub of national passenger transport. It is also served by several international trains to Russia. It is the center, with the neighbour Minsk Institut Kultury station, of a suburban rail linking the capital to several cities and town of its suburb in the district and through the region. The station is served by Minsk Metro at Ploshchad Lenina station (Lenin Square), part of the Maskoŭskaja line, and Vakzaĺnaja station, part of the Zelenaluzhskaya line.
