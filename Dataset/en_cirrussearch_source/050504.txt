Cole made his NHL debut on November 6, 2010 after being recalled from Peoria on November 4. He scored his first NHL goal on March 9, 2011 against Columbus Blue Jackets goaltender, Mathieu Garon. On March 2, 2015, the Pittsburgh Penguins acquired Ian Cole from the Blues in exchange for Robert Bortuzzo and a 2016 7th-round draft pick. On June 29, 2015, Cole signed a three-year contract worth $6.3 million to remain in Pittsburgh. In the 2015–16 season, Cole registered 12 assists in 70 games.

As a free agent in the off-season, Cole signed a three-year, $12.75 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche on July 1, 2018. On February 8, during a 2018–19 regular season game against the Washington Capitals, Cole laid a late hit on Evgeny Kuznetsov resulting in a fight with Tom Wilson. It was determined that Tom Wilson had fractured Cole's orbital bone and he was subsequently placed on Colorado's injured reserve. Entering his final year under contract with the Avalanche in the pandemic delayed 2020–21 season, Cole played in a third pairing role in the opening two games.[citation needed] On January 19, 2021, Cole was traded by the Avalanche to divisional rival club, the Minnesota Wild, in exchange for Greg Pateryn. Cole made an instant impact, solidifying the Wild's third pairing and helping the team push up the standings in recording 1 goal and 8 points through 52 regular season games. In a first-round series defeat to the Vegas Golden Knights, Cole featured in all seven games. As a free agent, despite showing interest to return to the Wild, Cole was unable to come to terms and was signed to a one-year, $2.9 million contract with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 28, 2021. He scored the overtime game-winning goal against the New York Rangers in Game 1 of their 2nd round series in the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs. Having concluded his contract with the Hurricanes, Cole was again on the move in agreeing to a one-year, $3 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning on July 13, 2022. The Lightning announced the team had suspended Cole, with pay, on October 10, 2022, pending an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse. "I take the allegations made against me today in an anonymous tweet very seriously," Cole said in a statement made through his agent. "I look forward to clearing my name and demonstrating to the NHL and the Tampa Bay Lightning that these allegations are unfounded." Ultimately, both the team and league investigations into Cole found no evidence that the allegations were truthful. After a lone season with the Lightning, Cole left as a free agent and was signed to a one-year, $3 million contract with the Vancouver Canucks for the 2023–24 season on July 1, 2023. Cole's first international experience came at the 2007 World Junior Championships.
