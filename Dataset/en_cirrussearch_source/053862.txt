He made his debut on 5 September, as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 league defeat to Atalanta. Following the end of the loan spell, on 5 July 2023, Monza signed Izzo permanently on a three-year deal. On 5 November 2016, Izzo was called up to the senior squad for the first time by Gian Piero Ventura for Italy's 2018 FIFA World Cup Qualification match against Liechtenstein and a friendly match against Germany. On 15 March 2019, Izzo received a call up from Roberto Mancini for Italy's UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying matches against Finland and Liechtenstein later that month. On 26 March, he made his senior international debut in a 6–0 home win over Liechtenstein. On 23 May 2016, Izzo, along with midfielders Luca Pini and Francesco Millesi, was put under investigation by the anti-mafia police department in Naples (DDA) after being accused of being directly involved with a Camorra clan based in Secondigliano in altering the results of the Serie B matches Modena–Avellino (1–0) from 17 March 2014, and Avellino–Reggina (3–0) from 25 May 2014. On 3 March 2017, the Italian Football Federation's prosecutor asked for Izzo to be suspended for six years, also requesting that collateral estoppel be applied, and demanded that he should receive a €20,000 fine. On 12 April, he received an 18-month ban from football and was also fined €50,000. On 19 May, his ban was reduced to six months. On 4 May 2023, Izzo was found guilty of associating with the Camorra and sporting fraud, and sentenced to five years in prison. Izzo is a right-footed defender who mainly plays as a centre-back. He has often played in a three-man back-line throughout his career, a position which best utilises his dynamism, and which also allows him to contribute offensively as well as defensively. He has also been deployed as a right-sided full-back on occasion. A strong, hard-working, and tenacious defender, he is known for his tackling ability and anticipation.
