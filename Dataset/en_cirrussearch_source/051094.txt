The Imperial Crypt (German: Kaisergruft), also called the Capuchin Crypt (Kapuzinergruft), is a burial chamber beneath the Capuchin Church and monastery in Vienna, Austria. It was founded in 1618 and dedicated in 1632, and located on the Neuer Markt square of the Innere Stadt, near the Hofburg Palace. Since 1633, the Imperial Crypt serves as the principal place of entombment for the members of the House of Habsburg. The bones of 145 Habsburg royalty, plus urns containing the hearts or cremated remains of four others, are here, including 12 emperors and 18 empresses. The visible 107 metal sarcophagi and five heart urns range in style from puritan plain to exuberant rococo. Some of the dozen resident Capuchin friars continue their customary role as the guardians and caretakers of the crypt, along with their other pastoral work in Vienna. The most recent entombment was in 2023. Anna of Tyrol1, wife of Emperor Matthias2 conceived the idea of a Capuchin cloister and burial crypt for herself and her husband, to be built in the neighborhood of the Hofburg castle in Vienna. She provided funds for it in the will she made on 10 November 1617 and died the following year in 1618 which released the funds, allowing for planning and construction to commence. Her spouse died in 1619. The foundation stone was laid on 8 September 1622 in the presence of Emperor Ferdinand IIx578 and after slow progress caused by the distractions of the Thirty Years' War the church was dedicated on 25 July 1632. At Easter the following year, the simple sarcophagi containing the remains of Emperor Matthias2 and Empress Anna1 were transferred with great ceremony to what is now called the Founders Vault. Emperor Leopold I37 enlarged the crypt in 1657 in the area under the nave of the church and his son Emperor Joseph I35 extended it further westward and built another mausoleum chamber and a chapel to the east in 1710, but awkwardly, beginning the vault that his brother Emperor Charles VI40 continued westward in 1720 that extends under the chancel and the apse choir above. For the first time, a well-known architect (Lukas von Hildebrandt) was involved with an enlargement of the crypt. In 1754, his daughter Empress Maria Theresa56 went even further west, completely past the church above, into the monastery garden with her domed addition that admits natural light. The imposing dome and crypt is the work of architect Jean Jadot de Ville-Issey. During the reign of her grandson Emperor Francis II57 architect Johann Aman turned to the north for his addition in 1824. The monastery surrounding the church had fallen into disrepair after 200 years of constant use, so during the reign of Emperor Ferdinand62 in 1840 the monastery (but not the church) was torn down and rebuilt. As part of that project, architect Johann Höhne built the Ferdinand Vault and the Tuscan Vault as part of the basement of the new structure. As part of the jubilee celebrating his 60 years on the throne in 1908, Emperor Franz Joseph142 had architect Cajo Perisic build another mausoleum chamber and a chapel to the east of Franz II57 and Ferdinand's62 vaults. At the same time, new annexes for visitors were created on either side of the church. By 1960 it was obvious from the deteriorating condition of the tombs that the environment of changing heat and humidity needed to be controlled if the historic sarcophagi were to survive for future generations. The New Vault, north of the Tuscan, Ferdinand's and the Franz Joseph Vault, was built by architect Karl Schwanzer, with metal doors by sculptor Rudolf Hoflehner. It added about 20% to the space of the crypt, and was used as part of a massive rearrangement of the tombs in the vaults. The original small vault had held, besides the tombs of the two founders, those of a dozen children and had been called the Angel's Vault. Those were moved to open niches newly made in the front wall of the Leopold Vault. Selected tombs from various other vaults were moved to the New Vault and grouped in themes such as Bishops, the direct ancestors of the last reigning emperor, and the immediate family of Archduke Charles122 the victor of Aspern. Thirty seven other tombs, of some minors and minor members of the ruling family, were walled-up into four piers created in the Ferdinand Vault. Thus about half of all the tombs were moved out of the original vaults to more orderly places as part of that great reorganization. In 2003 another project made the crypt accessible to disabled visitors, and opened previously unused doors so that the visitor route no longer requires the 100% backtracking that was necessary before. The entire crypt was also air conditioned to prevent deterioration of the tombs. The free-standing tombs are usually variations of either a flat-topped storage chest, or a tub with sloping sides and a convex lid of tapered decks. Ornamentation ranges from simple to elaborate. Until far in the 18th century, the most common material for a sarcophagus here was a bronze-like alloy of tin, coated with shellac. The splendid tombs of the baroque and rococo eras are made of true bronze, a nobler and therefore more expensive material. Reforming Emperor Joseph II42 decreed simplified burial customs for the people, and introduced the use of lighter and cheaper copper into the Imperial Crypt, where it was then used into the 19th century. In the later 19th century a mixture of cast brass and bronze as well as silver-bronzed copper was adopted. Other metals were used only rarely, except for silver and gold plating on decorations. Various techniques of metalworking were used: full casting for the sarcophagus; hollow casting for decorative sculpture; carving, engraving, and hammered relief for surface decoration. The parts for chests and covers are riveted together, ornaments and decorative figures are screwed on. The sculptor responsible for the most elaborate tombs is Balthasar Ferdinand Moll. In order to guarantee the stability of the enormous display tombs, they have iron bracings and wood lining inside. This avoids both cave-ins and a buckling of the side walls from the weight of the cover. The cover of the double tomb of Empress Maria Theresa56 and her husband55 alone weighs approximately 1700 kg (3800 lb). Within the outer case lies a wooden coffin that is wrapped in silk (black with gold trim for rulers, red with silver trim for others). The coffin usually has two locks, the key to one is kept by the Capuchin Guardian of the crypt, the other is kept in the Schatzkammer of the Hofburg palace in Vienna. Within the coffin, the body usually has had the organs removed as a necessary part of the embalming process for its display before the funeral. For about one-third of the bodies, the heart has been placed into a silver urn and sent elsewhere (usually the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche), and for some the intestines and other organs have been put into a copper urn and deposited in the Dukes Crypt in the catacombs of Vienna's cathedral, the Stephansdom. Over the centuries, constant humidity, variations in temperature, and the host of visitors had taken a great toll on the sarcophagi. Corrosion craters, holes and tears had developed. Layers of the horizontal surfaces had peeled, base plates had broken through, decorative fixtures had been broken or stolen by visitors, the cast metal absorbed too much humidity and puffed up, and heavy covers had caused some sidewalls to bend or cave. The first major restoration effort was undertaken in 1852, but further work was needed by 1956 when the Gesellschaft zur Rettung der Kapuzinergruft (Association for Saving the Capuchin Crypt) came into being to inform the public of the problem, raise funds, and preserve and restore the tombs. It was first necessary to create additional space and to dehumidify the crypt. After completion of the New Vault in 1960 and the transfer of 26 tombs from the overflowing Tuscan Vault, the work of dehumidification could begin. Also, a workshop was created in the south end of the Tuscan Vault where highly skilled artisans could work on selected tombs temporarily moved there for restoration. In 2003 remodelling of the ground-level visitor facilities took place to create a new visitor entrance and make the crypt accessible to disabled visitors. The visitor route was also changed so that visitors now see the tombs in historical sequence by entering at one end and leaving at the other, instead of both entering and leaving via a single stairway that is in the middle of the route. Most importantly, the entire crypt was air conditioned so that humidity can be controlled. The repair and conservation of the artistic work takes place in close cooperation with the monks, the Association, the Austrian Monument Office and the Vienna Old City Preservation Fund. The bodies of 145 people (mainly members of the ruling line of the House of Habsburg and the successor House of Habsburg-Lorraine), plus urns containing the hearts or cremated remains of four others, are deposited in one of the ten interconnected Vaults of the Imperial Crypt. They include 12 Emperors and 18 Empresses. The most recent entombment, that of Archduchess Yolande of Austria, wife of Archduke Carl Ludwig, was on 7 October 2023. From other families there are 33 spouses, plus four others,who have found their resting place here. The longest-lived person entombed here is Yolande De Ligne, aged 100 years and 5 months. The next longest-lived is Otto Von Habsburg150,eldest son of the last Austrian emperor, at 98 years. Several died at birth and over 25% of those entombed here were five years of age or younger when they died. Emperors buried here: Emperor Matthias Emperor Ferdinand III Emperor Leopold I Emperor Joseph I Emperor Charles VI Emperor Francis I Stephen, husband of Maria Theresa Emperor Joseph II Emperor Leopold II Emperor Francis II Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria Emperor Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria Empresses buried here: Anna, consort of Emperor Mathias Maria Anna,consort of Emperor Ferdinand III Eleonora Magdalena, consort of Emperor Ferdinand III Maria Leopoldine, consort of Emperor Ferdinand III Margaret Theresa, consort of Emperor Leopold I Eleonora Magdalena , consort of Emperor Leopold I Elisabeth Christina, consort of Emperor Charles VI Empress Maria Theresa Maria Josepha, consort of Emperor Joseph II Isabella Maria, consort of Emperor Joseph II Elisabeth Wilhelmine, consort of Emperor Francis II Maria Theresa consort of Emperor Francis II Maria Ludovika, consort of Emperor Francis II Karoline Augusta, consort of Emperor Francis II Archduchess Maria Louise , Empress of France Maria Anna, consort of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria Elisabeth , consort of Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria Zita, consort of Emperor Charles of Austria (Also, the hearts of Empresses Claudia Felicitas and Amalie Wilhemine are here, but their bodies are buried elsewhere.) All 146 persons buried here (in whole or in part) are shown on the directory charts below, together with links to a detailed text listing. For ease of use, they show the Habsburg family buried here as family trees based upon lines of descent. Go directly to family of the Founders (c. 1450 – c. 1650) Go directly to descendants of Emperor Ferdinand III (c. 1600 – c. 1750) Go directly to descendants of Empress Maria Theresa (c. 1725 – c. 1875) Go directly to descendants of Emperor Leopold II (c. 1750 – c. 1900) Go directly to descendants of Emperor Francis II (c. 1775 – end of the monarchy) Go directly to descendants of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany (c. 1775 – c. 1900). The vaults consist of an interconnected series of ten subterranean vaulted rooms, built at various times as more space was needed. The visible 107 metal sarcophagi and five heart urns range in style from puritan plain to exuberant rococo. The bodies of 145 nobles, plus urns containing the hearts or cremated remains of four others, are deposited here. There is only one space left. They include 12 Emperors and 18 Empresses. The most recent entombment149 was in 2023. From other families there are 33 spouses, plus four others,15 41 47 117 who have found their resting place here. Everyone else in the Imperial Crypt was born with the Habsburgs-only title of Archduke or Archduchess. In 1960, with the various vaults overcrowded, a major rearrangement project began which resulted in the construction of the Children's Columbarium and the New Vault. At the same time many bodies were moved to those new areas, others were moved from the Tuscan Vault and the Ferdinand Vault and walled up into the corner piers of the Ferdinand Vault. The Gründergruft is the oldest part of the Kaisergruft, dating from the original construction of the church (completed in 1632), and lies under the Emperor Chapel at the left of the nave of the church above. The room is low, plain, and windowless, and visible through baroque gates from the Leopold Vault. Here stand the two plain sarcophagi of the founding couple. Looking through the gate, from left to right: 2 Emperor Matthias (1557–1619) →Family Tree Third son of Emperor Maximilian II.x527 Once governor of the Austrian Netherlands, he wrested power over Austria, Hungary and Moravia from his inept brother Emperor Rudolf IIx552 in 1608 and inherited the rest in 1612. He built the original hunting lodge that became Schönbrunn, and died only three months after his wife Empress Anna.1 His heart is buried in urn 2 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche. His intestines are buried in urn 18 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 1 Empress Anna of Tyrol (4 October 1585 – 15 December 1618) →Family Tree Daughter of Ferdinand II, Duke of Tyrol and wife of her cousin Emperor Matthias2 who was 28 years older than she was. She provided in her will of 1617 for the establishment of a crypt for her and her husband in a Capuchin's Church to be built in Vienna, and died only one year later, at age 33 after seven years of a childless marriage. Her heart is buried in urn 1 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche. Her intestines are buried in urn 17 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. The Leopoldsgruft was built under the nave of the church above, beginning in 1657 by Emperor Leopold I of Austria,37 following the edict of his father Emperor Ferdinand III27 that the hereditary burial place of the imperial family would be in this church. Considering that Leopold contributed his three wives and 16 of his children—plus himself—to the population of the crypt, it was inevitable that other vaults would be needed soon. Turning to the left of the gates to the Founders Vault, in the thick east foundation wall of the church are twelve longitudinal recessed niches built in the 1960s containing sarcophagi of 12 children. The coffins had previously been in either the Founders Vault or the main hall of this vault, but were generally in poor condition and have now been placed into identical cases. No markings or documentation identifies which child lies in which coffin, but those buried in these niches are: Four children of Emperor Ferdinand III27: 3 Archduke Maximilian Thomas (1638–1639) →Family Tree Infant son of Emperor Ferdinand III27 and Empress Maria Anna.22 4 Archduke Philipp August (1637–1639) →Family Tree Two-year-old son of Emperor Ferdinand III27 and Empress Maria Anna.22 5 Archduchess Theresia Maria (1652–1653) →Family Tree Infant daughter of Emperor Ferdinand III27 and Empress Eleonora.19 6 Archduke Ferdinand Josef (1657–1658) →Family Tree Infant son of Emperor Ferdinand III27 and Empress Eleonora.19 His viscera are buried in urn 22 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. Seven children of Emperor Leopold I37: 7 Archduke Ferdinand Wenzel (1667–1668) →Family Tree Infant son of Emperor Leopold I37 and Empress Margarita Teresa.20 His intestines are buried in urn 25 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 8 Archduke Johann Leopold (1670) →Family Tree Infant son of Emperor Leopold I37 and Empress Margarita Teresa.20 His intestines are buried in urn 27 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 10 Archduchess Maria Anna (1672) →Family Tree Infant daughter of Emperor Leopold I37 and Empress Margarita Teresa.20 Her intestines are buried in urn 28 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 11 Archduchess Anna Maria Sophia (1674) →Family Tree Infant daughter of Emperor Leopold I37 and Empress Claudia Felicitas.24 Her viscera are buried in urn 30 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 12 Archduchess Maria Josepha (1675–1676) →Family Tree Infant daughter of Emperor Leopold I37 and Empress Claudia Felicitas.24 Her heart is in a gold and silver urn atop her mother's sarcophagus in the Dominican Church. Her viscera are buried in urn 32 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 13 Archduchess Christina (1679) →Family Tree Infant daughter of Emperor Leopold I37 and Empress Eleonora Magdelena.32 14 Archduchess Maria Margareta (1690–1691) →Family Tree Infant daughter of Emperor Leopold I37 and Empress Eleonora Magdelena.32 Her heart is buried in urn 34, and her viscera in urn 35, in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. Grandson of Emperor Ferdinand III27: 15 Unnamed (1686) →Family Tree Son of Johann Wilhelm of Pfalz-Neuberg and Archduchess Maria Anna Josepha.17 In front of the Children's Columbarium: 9 (Urn containing the heart of) Queen Maria Anna of Portugal (9 July 1683 – 14 August 1754) →Family Tree Daughter of Emperor Leopold I.37 Her body is in the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora in Lisbon, beside her husband John V of Portugal. Proceeding along the north wall, east-to-west: 16 Archduchess Maria Josepha (1687–1703) →Family Tree Sixteen-year-old daughter of Emperor Leopold I.37 Her heart is buried in urn 10 the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche, and her viscera are buried in urn 40 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 17 Archduchess Maria Anna Josepha (20 December 1654 – 4 April 1689) →Family Tree Daughter of Emperor Ferdinand III.27 Wife of Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. 18 Queen Eleonora Maria of Poland (21 May 1653 – 17 December 1697) →Family Tree Daughter of Emperor Ferdinand III.27 Wife of Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki, King of Poland, then of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, by whom she became grandmother of the two brothers who married Empress Maria Theresia56 and her sister.39 19 Empress Eleonora Magdalena (18 November 1630 – 6 December 1686) →Family Tree Third wife of Emperor Ferdinand III.27 Foundress of the Order of the Starry Cross (the Sternkreuzorden).

He established the tradition of burial of different parts in three separate Vienna churches. 30 Archduke Leopold Johann (13 April 1716 – 4 November 1716) →Family Tree Six-month-old only son of Emperor Charles VI.40 His death later led to the War of the Austrian Succession because his father had no other male heirs. His heart is buried in urn 43, and his viscera in urn 44, in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 31 Archduchess Maria Magdalena (26 March 1689 – 1 May 1743) →Family Tree Daughter of Emperor Leopold I.37 32 Empress Eleonora Magdalena of Pfalz-Neuburg (6 January 1655 – 19 January 1720) →Family Tree Third wife of Emperor Leopold I.37 The first part of the Charles Vault (Karlsgruft) was built in 1710 by Emperor Joseph I.35 In 1720 it was extended by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt on the orders of Emperor Charles VI40 and shelters 8 containers: Proceeding along the south wall, from left to right: 37 Emperor Leopold I (9 June 1640 – 5 May 1705) →Family Tree Second son of Emperor Ferdinand III27 and father of Emperors Joseph I35 and Charles VI.40 He repelled an effort by the Muslims to conquer Europe at the Second Siege of Vienna. He built the Leopold's Wing of the Hofburg, used today as the offices of the president of Austria. He can be seen sculpted, kneeling prayer for the end of the plague epidemic, on the plague column (Pestsäule) in Vienna. Died at age 65 after a reign of 48 years. His three wives and 16 of his children are buried here. His heart is buried in urn 11 the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and his viscera are in urn 41 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 38 Archduchess Maria Elisabeth (1680–1741) →Family Tree Daughter of Emperor Leopold I.37 Unmarried, she was appointed governor of the Austrian Netherlands in her own right and when she died at age 69, was originally buried in Brussels but was transferred here 8 years later. Her heart is buried in urn 14 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and her viscera are in urn 51 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 39 Archduchess Maria Anna (14 September 1718 – 16 December 1744) →Family Tree Daughter of Emperor Charles VI.40 and sister of Empress Maria Theresia.56 She married Charles of Lorraine, brother of Maria Theresia's husband, Emperor Franz I Stephen.55 They were joint governors of the Austrian Netherlands. She died in Brussels at age 24 whence her body was transferred at her sister's order. Her heart is buried in urn 15 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and her viscera are in urn 52 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 40 Emperor Charles VI (1 October 1685 – 20 October 1740) →Family Tree Younger son of Emperor Leopold I.37 Raised in Spain in preparation to inherit the Spanish throne upon the death of his childless cousin, the War of the Spanish Succession ended when Charles unexpectedly inherited the Empire upon his brother Joseph's35 early death and no one wanted to allow the dominance that would come from empowering Charles with both realms. Moving to Vienna, he brought the Spanish Riding School with him and built the magnificent hall it uses today. Because he had no surviving male heirs,30 he negotiated the Pragmatic Sanction to assure that his daughter Maria Theresa56 would succeed him, going so far as to pre-bribe the nine Electors but, of course, once he died they ignored their promises but kept the money, resulting in the War of the Austrian Succession. He died after a reign of 29 years, at age 55 after catching a cold while hunting. His heart is buried in urn 13 the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and his viscera are in urn 48 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. His tomb is one of the most remarkable, with a death's head at each corner wearing one of the distinctive crowns of his major realms (the Empire, Bohemia, Hungary, and Austria). The empty plaza at the west third of this vault was used as the area for reception ceremonies when new bodies were brought in after the funeral ceremonies upstairs. Returning along the north wall, from left to right: 36 Empress Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (28 August 1691 – 21 December 1750) →Family Tree Wife (1708) of Emperor Charles VI40 and mother of Empress Maria Theresa.56 Died at age 59 of heart failure brought on by corpulence and rheumatism. Her sarcophagus is the earliest by Balthasar Ferdinand Moll. Her heart is buried in urn 17 the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and her viscera are buried in urn 53 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 35 Emperor Joseph I (1678–1711) →Family Tree Son of Emperor Leopold I.37 Allied with the British during the War of the Spanish Succession where his great general Eugene of Savoy worked with the Duke of Marlborough to prevent the throne of Spain going to the French. With no surviving son,33 he died of the black pox at age 33 after a reign of 6 years. The heart of his wife34 is nearby. His heart is buried in urn 12 the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and his viscera are buried separately in urn 42 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. 34 (Urn containing the heart of ) Empress Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick (21 April 1673 – 10 April 1742) →Family Tree Wife (1699) of Emperor Joseph I.35 The wing of the Hofburg in which she had living space during her widowhood is named after her, but she founded the Salesian Cloister in Vienna 1712 to educate young women and spent much of her time there. She died of edema at age 69. Her body lies dressed in a nun's habit entombed in a simple stone sarcophagus below the high altar in the Salesian Cloister in Vienna. 33 Archduke Leopold Joseph (1700–1701) →Family Tree Infant son of Emperor Joseph I.35 Died of hydrocephalus. His viscera are buried in urn 38 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. The three vaults of the Imperial Crypt held 44 bodies plus urns containing the hearts of two other persons when Empress Maria Theresa56 started construction of the Maria Theresien Gruft in 1754. It is behind the church above, with its dome rising into the monastery courtyard and contains the tombs of 16 persons: In the entrance archway: 42 Emperor Joseph II (Schönbrunn 13 March 1741 – Vienna 20 February 1790 →Family Tree Son of Empress Maria Theresa.56 A populist who became known as "the people's emperor," he initiated many reforms (including a prohibition on embalming and elaborate burials), many of which he repudiated in disillusionment shortly before his death. In keeping with his edict, his body is unembalmed and intact within a simple copper tomb. He died shortly before his 49th birthday after an official reign of 10 years. His equestrian statue in the Josefsplatz of the Hofburg palace is where Harry Lime's auto accident occurs in The Third Man. His two wives and two children are buried in this vault. In the small chamber immediately north of Emperor Joseph II42: 41 Countess Karoline von Fuchs-Mollard (1 January 1681 – 27 April 1754) →Family Tree Long-time family retainer and governess to Empress Maria Theresia,56 her sisters23 39 and her children. The inscription of gratitude on the lid of her sarcophagus is signed by Empress Maria Theresa,56 who ordered her burial with the imperial family (although she had no direct blood or matrimonial connection to the Habsburgs) when she died at age 73. In the center of the vault, from left to right: 56 Empress Maria Theresa (13 May 1717 – 29 November 1780) →Family Tree Eldest surviving descendant of Emperor Charles VI,40→Family Tree her ascension was contested and officially the crown of the Empire went to her husband (1736) Emperor Franz I Stephen.55 Dying at age 63, her forty years' reign is thought of by the Austrians as the British think of Queen Victoria: the golden years of power, prestige and empire. A prominent statue of her enthroned and surrounded by her ministers is a landmark at the entrance to the Museumsplatz. Her heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche. 55 Emperor Franz I Stephen (Lunéville 8 December 1708 – Innsbruck 18 August 1765) →Family Tree Duke of Lorraine and Grand Duke of Tuscany. Husband of Empress Maria Theresa,56 he died at age 56 after nominally being Emperor for 25 years. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche. This double tomb of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband, Francis I Stephen, sculpted by Balthasar Ferdinand Moll is of particular artistic merit and is probably the most glorious in terms of design. In the small chamber immediately south of Emperor Joseph II42: 43 Archduchess Maria Karolina (17 September 1748 – 17 September 1748) →Family Tree Still-born daughter of Emperor Franz I Stephen55 and Empress Maria Theresa. Along the south wall, young children of Emperor Franz I Stephen55 and Empress Maria Theresa.56 From left to right: 44 Archduke Karl Joseph Emanuel Johann Nepomuck Anton Prokop (1 February 1745 – 18 January 1761) →Family Tree Second son of Emperor Franz I Stephen55 and Empress Maria Theresa. Died of smallpox shortly before his 16th birthday. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche. 45 Archduchess Marie Johanna Gabriele Josephe Antonie (4 February 1750 – 23 December 1762 →Family Tree Eighth daughter of Emperor Franz I Stephen55 and Empress Maria Theresa.56 Died of smallpox at age 12.

Had issue from two morganatic marriages. The Toscanagruft was built in 1842, along with the Ferdinand Vault. At that time there were 85 bodies plus the heart urns of three other persons in the five vaults of the crypt. The Tuscan Vault once held many more than the present 14 tombs, but most were moved to the New Vault or enclosed within the piers of the Ferdinand Vault during the major rearrangement of 1960. The 5-meter wide vault is very large, being 21 meters long, and extends along the entire western lengths of both the Ferdinand Vault and the Franz Vault, ending only when it meets the outside wall of the west transept of the Maria Theresia Vault. This vault takes its name from the many descendants of the younger sons of Emperor Leopold II,113 as Grand Duke of Tuscany, who are entombed here.

Her heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche. 113 Emperor Leopold II (1747–1792) →Family Tree Third son of Empress Maria Theresa.56 →Family Tree Most of his career was spent in Florence, reforming the governance there as Grand Duke of Tuscany, and only his final two years were as Emperor.

Having no surviving descendant, he left most of his huge estate to his ill-fated cousin Archduke Franz Ferdinand,x863 who subsequently used the title Archduke of Austria-Este. The art collection of his now-extinct branch, accumulated over centuries, is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. The Neue Gruft was built between 1960 and 1962 under the monastery grounds as a 280 square meter enlargement to eliminate the overcrowded jumble of 140 bodies (plus cremation and heart urns of four other persons) in the other nine vaults, and to provide a climate-controlled environment to protect the metal sarcophagi from further deterioration. Its stark concrete walls evoke the solemnity of death. The New Vault is entered from the Ferdinand Vault, and exits into the back of the Franz Joseph Vault.

Her heart is buried in the Hofkapelle in Innsbruck. Proceeding along the east wall, from north to south, the direct ancestors of the last emperors: 135 Archduke Franz Karl (1802–1878) →Family Tree Third son of Emperor Franz II.57 When his elder brother Emperor Ferdinand62 abdicated in 1848, he stood aside so that his son, Emperor Franz Joseph,142 could succeed to the throne instead.

She would probably wish her tomb was not exactly where it now is. She accompanied the last reigning emperor, Karl Ix887 into exile, and spent the remainder of her life with his family after his death. By 1908 the seven vaults of the crypt already held 129 bodies, plus the heart urns of another three persons. In that year the Franz Josephs Gruft was built, along with the adjacent Chapel, as part of the celebrations of Emperor Franz Joseph's142 60 years on the throne. The vault is usually entered from the north wall in the rear, through the southeast door of the New Vault.

The Gruftkapelle was built, along with the Franz Joseph Vault, in 1908. It is usually entered from the south doorway of the Franz Joseph Vault.

Because Sophie could not be buried here, the couple is buried instead in the crypt of the castle at Artstetten. Ahead, to the right of the altar along the south wall: 150 Archduke Otto (1912–2011) →Family Tree , eldest son of Emperor Karl I of Austriax887 and claimant to the thrones (renounced in 1961) and later (1979) elected by German voters to a seat in the European Parliament, where after many reelections he served longer than any other member.

A specific place in the Crypt Chapel was reserved for Archduchess Yolande (1923–2023), wife (1950) of Archduke Carl Ludwig148. There is room for two others along the east wall. Any other entombments would most easily be located along the south wall in the New Vault. There is also room in the Tuscan Vault, but that would not follow the generally chronological arrangement of the tombs. Cremated remains can be accommodated within the piers in the corners of the Ferdinand Vault. Since 1971 members of the family (e.g. Archduke Rudolf (1919–2010)) are mostly entombed in the crypt of the Loretto Chapel of the Benedictine Monastery at Muri, Switzerland, which was founded in 1027 by Count Radebot von Habsburg.
