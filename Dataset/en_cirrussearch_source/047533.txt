Soyuz MS-12 was a Soyuz spaceflight which launched on 14 March 2019, carrying three members of the Expedition 59 crew to the International Space Station. The mission ended on 3 October 2019, when Soyuz-MS-12 (carrying Ovchinin, Hague, and spaceflight participant Hazza Al Mansouri) successfully landed. Soyuz MS-12 was scheduled to be the debut flight for Hazza Al Mansouri or Sultan Al Neyadi, the first two astronauts from the United Arab Emirates, but this was delayed to flight Soyuz MS-15 following the Soyuz MS-10 mission failure. Counting the aborted flight of Soyuz MS-10, even though this did not quite cross the Kármán line. This matches NASA's count, though RSA follows the Kármán line definition.
