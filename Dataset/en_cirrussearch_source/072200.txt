Euporie /ˈjuːpəriː/, also known as Jupiter XXXIV, is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the temporary designation S/2001 J 10. Euporie is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 19.266 million km in 550.69 days, at an inclination of 145.7° to the ecliptic, in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.148. It is affected by the Kozai mechanism. It was named in August 2003 after Euporie, a Greek goddess of abundance and one of the Horae in Greek mythology (and thus a daughter of Zeus). It is a member of the Ananke group. Brian G. Marsden (15 May 2002). "MPEC 2002-J54: Eleven New Satellites of Jupiter". International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center. per "eupory".
