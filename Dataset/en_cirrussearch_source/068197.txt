The 2023–24 UEFA Europa League is the 53rd season of Europe's secondary club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 15th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the UEFA Europa League. The final will be played at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. The winners of the tournament will automatically qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League group stage, and also earn the right to play against the winners of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League in the 2024 UEFA Super Cup, and the winners of the 2023 Copa Sudamericana in the 2024 UEFA–CONMEBOL Club Challenge. This edition will be the final season with the current format of 32 teams participating in the group stage, after UEFA announced that a brand new format would be introduced for the following edition. Due to the format change, no clubs can be transferred from the Champions League group stage to the UEFA Europa League under the Swiss format, and this edition's winners onwards will no longer be able to defend the title. Sevilla were the defending champions, but could not defend their title after being eliminated from European competition in the group stage of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League. A total of 57 teams from 34 of the 55 UEFA member associations are participating in the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League. Among them, 15 associations had teams directly qualifying for the Europa League, while for the other 40 associations that did not have any teams directly qualifying, 19 of them have teams playing after being transferred from the Champions League (the only member association which could not have a participant was Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league, and could only enter their cup winner into the Europa Conference League given their association ranking). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: The title holders of the UEFA Europa Conference League were given an entry in the Europa League (if they did not qualify for the Champions League through league performance). Associations 1–5 each had two teams qualify. Associations 6–16 (except Russia) each had one team qualify. 36 teams eliminated from the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League were transferred to the Europa League. For the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2022 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2017–18 to 2021–22. Apart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Europa League, as noted below: (UCL) – Additional teams transferred from the UEFA Champions League (UECL) – Additional berth for UEFA Europa Conference League title holders The following is the access list for this season. Due to the suspension of Russia for the 2023–24 European season, the following changes to the access list were made: The cup winners of associations 13 (Belgium) and 14 (Switzerland) entered the play-off round instead of the third qualifying round. The cup winners of association 16 (Czech Republic) entered the third qualifying round instead of the Europa Conference League second qualifying round. The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round: ECL: Europa Conference League title holders CW: Cup winners 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc.: League position of the previous season UCL: Transferred from the Champions League GS: Third-placed teams from the group stage CH/LP PO: Losers from the play-off round (Champions/League Path) CH/LP Q3: Losers from the third qualifying round (Champions/League Path) CH/LP Q2: Losers from the second qualifying round (Champions/League Path) The third qualifying round was divided into Champions Path (CH) and Main Path (MP).

The mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows: In the draw for the knockout round play-offs, the eight group runners-up were seeded, and the eight Champions League group third-placed teams were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. In the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight winners of the knockout round play-offs were unseeded. Again, the seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. In the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there are no seedings, and teams from the same association can be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals are held together before the quarter-finals are played, the identity of the quarter-final winners will not be known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw will also be held to determine which semi-final winner will be designated as the "home" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it is played at a neutral venue). The draw for the knockout round play-offs was held on 18 December 2023, 13:00 CET. The first legs were played on 15 February, and the second legs were played on 22 February 2024. The draw for the round of 16 was held on 23 February 2024, 12:00 CET. The first legs were played on 6 and 7 March, and the second legs were played on 14 March 2024. The draw for the quarter-finals was held on 15 March 2024, 13:00 CET. The first legs will be played on 11 April, and the second legs will be played on 18 April 2024. The draw for the semi-finals was held on 15 March 2024, 13:00 CET, after the quarter-final draw. The first legs will be played on 2 May, and the second legs will be played on 9 May 2024. The final will be played on 22 May 2024 at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. A draw was held on 15 March 2024, after the quarter-final and semi-final draw, to determine the "home" team for administrative purposes. 22 May 2024 (2024-05-22) 20:00 IST Aviva Stadium, Dublin Statistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.
