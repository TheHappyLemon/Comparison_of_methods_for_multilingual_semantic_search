The first written mention of Kuřim is from 1226 when the Margrave of Moravia Ottokar I issued a charter about the payment of tithes to the Church of Saints Peter and Paul. It was probably founded in the 12th century during the colonization by Přemyslids. In 1570, the settlement was promoted to a market town, but later lost the title.

After it was burned down in the Thirty Years' War, it was reconstructed in its today's late Baroque form in 1766–1772. The rectory was also founded in 1226. The original wooden structure was rebuilt after 1806. The original medieval fortress next to the church was rebuilt into a Renaissance residence in 1592–1594.
