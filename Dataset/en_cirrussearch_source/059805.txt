Kłodzko County (Polish: powiat kłodzki) is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, south-western Poland. It came into being on 1 January 1999 as a result of the Polish local government reforms passed in 1998. The county covers an area of 1,643 square kilometres (634 sq mi); its territory almost exactly corresponds to the former Bohemian, later Prussian, County of Kladsko (German: Grafschaft Glatz). It is located in a panhandle called Kłodzko Panhandle. The county's administrative seat is the town of Kłodzko; the other towns are: Duszniki-Zdrój, Nowa Ruda, Polanica-Zdrój, Bystrzyca Kłodzka, Kudowa-Zdrój, Lądek-Zdrój, Międzylesie, Radków, Stronie Śląskie and Szczytna. (The suffix Zdrój appearing in several of these names means "spa".) As of 2019 the total population of the county was 158,600. Kłodzko County is bordered by Wałbrzych County to the north-west, Dzierżoniów County to the north and Ząbkowice Śląskie County to the north-east.
