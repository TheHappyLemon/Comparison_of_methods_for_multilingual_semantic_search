Neurergus is a genus of salamanders, more specifically newts, in the family Salamandridae. They are found in the Middle East (predominantly in Turkey and Iran), and are kept and bred in captivity for their bright colors. In nature, they inhabit streams and small rivers, and the surrounding forests or shrublands. All of the Neurergus are considered threatened species, primarily due to destruction of habitat and overcollection for the pet trade. Generally, Neurergus species are dark-colored (brown to black) above, with a pattern of white to yellow to orange spots and lines. On their ventral sides, the lighter color of their spots becomes a solid color. Like most salamanders, they have five toes on their hind feet. Studies have demonstrated the genus Neurergus is monophyletic, containing these species: 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, accessed 19 January 2009. Steinfartz, S.; Hwang, U.
