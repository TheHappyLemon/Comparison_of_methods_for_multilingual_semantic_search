Vincent Jay (born 18 May 1985) is a former French biathlete and non-commissioned officer. During his career, he won two Olympic medals at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver - a gold in the sprint and a bronze medal in the pursuit.

He won a gold medal in the 10 km sprint and a Bronze medal in the 12.5 km pursuit at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Jay also won the 20 km individual race at the 2009 World Cup event in Vancouver. His Olympic victory came one year after his first victory in World Cup at the same venue. He was not considered a favourite to win gold but was seen as the fourth man in the French team after Vincent Defrasne, and Simon and Martin Fourcade. He caused surprise by winning France's first gold medal at the 2010 Olympic Games. He followed this up with a bronze medal in the pursuit two days later. This event gave him a level of fame in the media for which he wasn't prepared. After two seasons in halftone, he announced his retirement from the sport because of disappointing results in December 2012. In his last race he helped the French team to a second place in a World Cup relay in Hochfilzen. Jay married alpine skier Marie Marchand-Arvier in June 2014.
