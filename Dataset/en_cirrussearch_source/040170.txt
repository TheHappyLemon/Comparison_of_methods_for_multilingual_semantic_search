Sloane Stephens defeated Madison Keys in the final, 6–3, 6–0 to win the women's singles tennis title at the 2017 US Open. It was her first major title. Stephens became the first player using a protected ranking to win a major title. Additionally, she became the second unseeded woman in the Open Era to win the title (after Kim Clijsters in 2009). It was the first all-American final at the US Open since 2002, and for the first time at a major since the 1985 Wimbledon Championships, all four semifinalists were American, and all from the same country overall. Angelique Kerber was the defending champion, but was defeated in the first round by Naomi Osaka. Kerber became the second US Open defending champion to lose in the first round, after Svetlana Kuznetsova in 2005. Osaka herself would go on to win the title the next year. Garbiñe Muguruza became the new world No. 1 despite losing in the fourth round, after Karolína Plíšková failed to defend her finalist points. Eight of the top nine seeds (with the exception of Kerber) were in contention for the top ranking. This was Maria Sharapova's first major since the 2016 Australian Open, following a suspension for violating anti-doping rules. She was awarded a wildcard into the main draw, and was defeated by Anastasija Sevastova in the fourth round. Venus Williams became the first player in history to reach the semifinals of the US Open 10 years apart and then do so another 10 years apart (1997, 2007, and 2017). Kaia Kanepi became the first qualifier to reach the quarterfinals since Barbara Gerken in 1981, and was the lowest-ranked player ever to reach a major quarterfinal, having been ranked No. 418 prior to the tournament. This was the final Grand Slam tournament of former world No. 1 Jelena Janković, who lost to Petra Kvitová in the first round. Janković would formally retire from tennis five years later. 01.   Karolína Plíšková (quarterfinals) 02.   Simona Halep (first round) 03.   Garbiñe Muguruza (fourth round) 04.   Elina Svitolina (fourth round) 05.   Caroline Wozniacki (second round) 06.   Angelique Kerber (first round) 07.   Johanna Konta (first round) 08.   Svetlana Kuznetsova (second round) 09.   Venus Williams (semifinals) 10.   Agnieszka Radwańska (third round) 11.   Dominika Cibulková (second round) 12.   Jeļena Ostapenko (third round) 13.   Petra Kvitová (quarterfinals) 14.   Kristina Mladenovic (first round) 15.   Madison Keys (final) 16.   Anastasija Sevastova (quarterfinals) 17.   Elena Vesnina (third round) 18.   Caroline Garcia (third round) 19.   Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (first round) 20.   CoCo Vandeweghe (semifinals) 21.   Ana Konjuh (first round) 22.   Peng Shuai (second round) 23.   Barbora Strýcová (second round) 24.   Kiki Bertens (first round) 25.   Daria Gavrilova (second round) 26.   Anett Kontaveit (first round) 27.   Zhang Shuai (third round) 28.   Lesia Tsurenko (first round) 29.   Mirjana Lučić-Baroni (second round) 30.   Julia Görges (fourth round) 31.   Magdaléna Rybáriková (third round) 32.   Lauren Davis (first round) Click on the seed number of a player to go to their draw section.
