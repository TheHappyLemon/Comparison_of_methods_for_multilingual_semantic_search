Barysaw or Borisov (Belarusian: Барысаў, romanized: Barysaŭ, IPA: [baˈrɨsaw]; Russian: Борисов, IPA: [bɐˈrʲisəf]) is a city in Minsk Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Barysaw District. It is located on the Berezina River and 74 kilometres (46 mi) north-east from Minsk. As of 2023, it has a population of 136,409. Barysaw is first mentioned in the Laurentian Codex as being founded (as Borisov) in 1102 by the Prince of Polotsk Rogvolod Vseslavich, who had the baptismal name of Boris. During the next two centuries, it was burned and then rebuilt south of where it was before. From the late 13th century to 1795, the town was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was part of the Polish-Lithuanian union since the Union of Krewo (1385) and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Union of Lublin (1569). In 1500, during the Lithuanian–Muscovite War, Alexander Jagiellon resided in Barysaw Castle. In 1563, it was granted Magdeburg town rights by King Sigismund II Augustus. In the last years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, troops were stationed here, including the 2nd and 4th Lithuanian Vanguard Regiments and 1st Lithuanian Infantry Regiment. King Stanisław August Poniatowski established the town's coat of arms (decree #17435), the top half containing the coat of arms of Minsk, while the lower half had two stylized towers on a silver background with a passage between them and Saint Peter above the towers holding a key in his hand. Barysaw became part of the Russian Empire in 1793 as a result of the Second Partition of Poland. After the Partitions of Poland, Barysaw was an uyezd town in the Minsk Governorate. In 1812, Barysaw became a crucial location when Napoleon's troops crossed the Berezina river. The French feinted a crossing at the town itself, but successfully escaped the pursuing armies by building two wooden bridges north of the city, at Studianka. This event is reenacted by military locals during town festivals. A cannon from the Napoleonic era is kept by the town's museum. In 1871, the railway between Brest and Moscow passed near Barysaw, and a station was built there. In 1900 the area around the station was annexed the town. During World War I, after the fall of Tsarist Russia, fights broke out for control of the city and it changed owners several times. In November 1917 the area became a part of Soviet Russia, from early 1918 it was occupied by Germany, in December 1918 it fell to the Soviets again, from 1919 to 1920 it was controlled by Poland, before being captured by the Soviets for the third time. Soviet rule was recognized by the Peace of Riga in 1921 and the city was included in the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. During World War II, Barysaw was occupied by Nazi Germany from 2 July 1941 to 1 July 1944, and most of the city was destroyed. The Germans also operated the Dulag 126, Dulag 184, Dulag 240 and Stalag VI-H prisoner-of-war camps in the city. Since May 1948 the city has been home to the headquarters of the 7th Tank Army, which became the 65th Army Corps and then the North Western Operational Command of the Armed Forces of Belarus in 2001. In 2000s the Head of City Administration, or Mayor, was Vassily Burgun.
