Early in the 2023–24 season, Dynamo's new manager Marcel Lička began to deploy Laxalt in a defensive midfielder position. Laxalt was voted player of the month by Dynamo fans for July 2023. On 6 August 2023, in an away game against the defending champions Zenit Saint Petersburg, Laxalt assisted on Dynamo's winning goal deep in added time.
