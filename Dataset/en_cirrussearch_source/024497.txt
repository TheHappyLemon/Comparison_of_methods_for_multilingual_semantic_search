Zanjan province, or Zangan province (Persian: استان زنجان, Ostân-e Zanjân), is one of the 31 provinces of Iran, whose capital is the city of Zanjan. It is a mountainous province with close to 22,000 km2 of land placed in Iran's Region 3. Two-thirds of the people of the province live in the cities, mainly the capital and Abhar. At the time of the National Census of 2006, the population of the province was 942,818 in 235,771 households. The following census in 2011 counted 1,015,734 inhabitants living in 286,806 households. At the most recent census of 2016, the population had increased to 1,057,461 in 321,983 households. In Ptolemy's Geography, the city is referred to as Aganzana. It is said that the Sassanid king Ardashir I of Persia, reconstructed the city and called it Shahin, but later it was renamed Zangan: the present name is the Arabicized form. In past times Zanjan's name was Khamseh, which means "province with five tribes". Zanjan province incorporates areas of the former Gerrus province. At least since the era of Zand dynasty, Zanjan and its surrounding areas were called "Khamseh." For instance, in a book named "Mojmal al-Tawarikh-e Golestaneh", while it talks about the events of Karim Khan Zand era, it mentions the "Mahal-e Khamseh" which literally means "Khamseh areas" to refer to the areas of Zanjan province. Use of Khamseh for Zanjan could precedent the Zand era, as after the death of Nader shah and collapse of the great unification of Afshar tribes, the tribe of "Afshar-e Khamseh" returned to the "Mahal-e Khamseh". So the tribe name, was already containing the suffix of "Khamseh", since the era of Nader and possibly before they leave the Zanjan area to accompany Nader, therefore it can be concluded that at least since the time of Nader and Afsharids, the area was called as "Khamseh". It has been said that when Karim Khan Zand left Ardabil and Khalkhal to suppress Zaki Khan in Kashan, he entered the Zanjan, and in Abhar, he delegated the governorship of three areas of "Mahal-e Khamseh" to Zolfagharkhan-e Sultan Irlooy-e Afshar, and as such this is another sign for the area being named at the time of Zands as "Khamseh". Later at the time of Qajars also Zanjan province, was called as Khamseh. Etemad Al-Saltaneh in the book "Esker-ol-Tavarikh", when talks about Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar just before the formation of Qajar dynasty, uses the title of "Hakem-e Khamseh" (Governor of Khamseh). In addition, Mirza Abolhasan Khan Shirazi, in his travelogue in the year 1229 Hijri (around 1814 AC) mentions the "Khamseh". Among the European travellers, the first person who used the name "Khamseh" for the province where Zanjan city was located, was Pierre Amédée Jaubert who was sent by Napoleon Bonaparte to visit Fath Ali Shah's court, and in the year 1804 AC visited the Zanjan city.
