Bono began his youth career in Morocco, playing for Wydad AC.

He won two UEFA Europa League and Zamora Trophy with Sevilla. Born in Canada to Moroccan parents, Bono returned to Morocco at the age of three with his family. He has been a full international for Morocco since 2013. Having previously played for the under-23 team at the 2012 Olympics, he has represented his nation at two FIFA World Cup and four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. Bounou was born in Montreal, Quebec to Moroccan parents. His father, who is originally from the region of Taounate, moved to Canada when he was a child. Bounou and his parents moved to Casablanca, Morocco when he was 3 years old. He began playing in the streets as a child and joined Wydad AC at the age of 8 in 1999. He liked to play using his feet, but due to his height it was later suggested he become a goalkeeper; a challenge he accepted. The goalkeeper idol is Edwin van der Sar. His parents initially had mixed feelings regarding their son spending so much time playing football, but they later became more supportive as his talent became more evident. At 17 years old, his goalkeeping skills were spotted by a scout from OGC Nice, and he signed with the club; however due to bureaucratic problems he ended up not playing for Nice, and he returned to Wydad AC. In 2011, he made his senior debut in the club, after having been promoted to the first-team a year earlier.

He made his first-team debut on 24 July 2014, in a 1–0 pre-season friendly win against Numancia. On 1 September 2014, Bono was loaned to the Segunda División's Real Zaragoza, in a season-long deal. Kept out by Óscar Whalley for the first half of the campaign, he made his debut the following 11 January in a 5–3 loss at UD Las Palmas, and finished the season with 16 appearances. In the play-offs, after Whalley's performance led to a 0–3 home loss to Girona FC in the first leg, Bounou replaced him in the second for a 4–1 win and advancement on away goals; Zaragoza lost the final by the same rule to UD Las Palmas. On 23 July 2015, he returned to the Aragonese side, again in a one-year loan deal. On 12 July 2016, Bounou signed a permanent two-year contract with fellow league team Girona.

He was also selected in the 18-man under-23 squad for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but acted as a backup to Mohamed Amsif during the tournament, in which Morocco were eliminated at the group stage. In an interview, Bounou said that he had been contacted by the manager of the Canada national team, Benito Floro, but that this ultimately did not materialise. Moreover, he said to the interviewer that he grew up in Morocco, and deep down dreamed of representing the Moroccan national team.
