Chile competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Chile was 1 of 14 nations to have competed at the inaugural Summer Olympic Games, the only South American founding participant. One athlete, Luis Subercaseaux claimed to have competed for Chile in the 100, 400 and 800 metres, although it cannot be substantiated because the Official Report typically includes only medal winners and Subercaseaux did not win any.
