Datuk Jimmy Choo Yeang Keat PJN DIMP DSPN OBE (born 15 November 1948) is a Malaysian fashion designer based in the United Kingdom. He co-founded Jimmy Choo Ltd, which became known for its handmade women's shoes. Choo was born in 1948 in the Crown Colony of Penang, British Malaya, into a family of shoemakers. Of Chinese descent, his family name is Chew (Chinese: 周), but it was misspelled on his birth certificate as Choo. Choo's father, a shoemaker who made all of his shoes by hand, taught him the craft. "My parents were shoemakers and I have followed my father's lead. He inspired me," said Jimmy Choo. He made his first pair of shoes when he was 11 years old—a pair of slippers. Between 1982 and 1984, Choo studied at Cordwainers Technical College in Hackney (now part of the London College of Fashion) in London. He went to a design firm to work after graduation, wishing to remain in London permanently instead of returning to Malaysia. After college, Choo worked at two design companies for a total of nine years before starting his own business. Choo initially started with the help of the Prince's Trust. Choo's parents emigrated to Britain to help him get started, and he eventually expanded the business by opening his first shop in 1986, renting an old hospital building. His craftsmanship and designs were soon noticed at London Fashion Week in 1988. After seeing his creations, Vogue featured his shoes in an eight page spread. Choo has said that his designs became significantly more popular after the Vogue coverage. Patronage from Princess Diana in the early 1990s further bolstered his image. In 1996, Choo co-founded Jimmy Choo Ltd. with British Vogue magazine accessories editor Tamara Mellon. In April 2001, Choo sold his 50% stake in the company for £10 million. He has since concentrated his work on the exclusive Jimmy Choo couture line produced under license from Jimmy Choo Ltd. The Jimmy Choo London line, also known as Jimmy Choo Ready-To-Wear or, simply, Jimmy Choo, is under the purview of Tamara Mellon. The ready-to-wear line has expanded to include accessories such as handbags. In 2009, Choo claimed that his brand was a favourite of Diana, Princess of Wales. 2002: Appointed an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in recognition of his services to the shoe and fashion industry in the UK 2004: Awarded an honorary doctorate in art by De Montfort University, Leicester, UK, for his contribution to their unique Single Honours Footwear Design degree 2009: Awarded an Honorary Fellowship by University of the Arts London 2011: Winner of "The World's Outstanding Malaysian Designer 2011" Design for Asia Award for the "Daniel" part 2011: Winner of the "Outstanding Chinese Designer Award" for his accomplishments in the footwear industry. 2012: Received You Bring Charm to the World – the Most Influential Malaysian Award 2013: Became a member of the Red Dot product design jury.  Malaysia : Commander of the Order of Meritorious Service (PJN) – Datuk (2013)  Pahang : Knight Companion of the Order of the Crown of Pahang (DIMP) – Dato' (1999)  Penang : Officer of the Order of the Defender of State (DSPN) – Dato' (2004)  United Kingdom : Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) (2002) "Back from London to receive award".
