The Primera Divisió (First Division), also known as Lliga Multisegur Assegurances for sponsorship reasons is the top level of men's football in Andorra. The league was launched in 1995 sponsored by the local federation (Andorran Football Federation) which was created just one year before. Until then, clubs had played since 1970 in an amateur league without a structure or affiliation with any official institution. Since affiliation to UEFA and FIFA in 1996, Andorran clubs are able to compete in the UEFA competitions. Until 2015 the league was known as Lliga Grup Becier and during 2016 Lliga Grup Sant Eloi. It was renamed in 2017 as Lliga Multisegur Assegurances for sponsorship reasons. All the teams in the league play in the same stadiums owned by the federation. The same occurs in all other Andorran competitions, such as the Copa Constitució and Supercopa. FC Andorra, one of the major clubs in the country based in Andorra la Vella have never played in this league. They play in the Spanish league system, and are registered with the Royal Spanish Football Federation. The eight clubs that play in the league play each other three times in the same venue. After the first 21 rounds, the league splits in half, into a top four and bottom four. They then play the other three teams in their section twice more to give a total of 27 games. The last placed of the relegation round is relegated to Segona Divisió, the second highest football league in Andorra, while the penultimate classified play a two-legged relegation play-off against the runners-up of Segona Divisió.
