"Naḥnu Jund Allāh Jund al-Waṭan" (Arabic: نحن جند الله جند الوطن; English: "We are Soldiers of God, Soldiers of the Homeland") is the national anthem of Sudan. The words were written by the poet Ahmed Mohammed Saleh and the tune was composed by Ahmed Morjan in 1955. It is officially called the Republican Salute (especially when played musically), as it is called for short, the Flag Anthem or Flag Salute. The current national anthem of Sudan was originally the organizational anthem of the Sudan Defence Force prior to independence. The poem "We are the Soldiers of God, the Soldiers of Homeland" was chosen among other poems that participated in a general competition about poetic works praising the strength of the Sudan Defence Force in 1955. When Sudan gained independence in 1956, the first four verses of the poem were chosen to be the national anthem. As for the rest of the verses, they are not officially approved in the national anthem: See Help:IPA/Arabic and Sudanese Arabic. "Sudan – nationalanthems.info".
