Gunnbjørn Fjeld is the tallest mountain in Greenland, Denmark, and north of the Arctic Circle. It is a nunatak, a rocky peak protruding through glacial ice. Gunnbjørn Fjeld is located in the Watkins Range, an area of nunataks on the east coast, which contains several other summits above 3,500 metres. Its height is often given as 3,700 metres (12,139 ft), although figures vary slightly. Gunnbjørn Fjeld was first climbed on 16 August 1935 by Augustine Courtauld, Jack Longland, Ebbe Munck and Lawrence Wager. It is named after Gunnbjörn Ulfsson, the first European to have sighted Greenland. The peak rises in an uninhabited part of the eastern coast of Greenland. The mountain is climbed infrequently due to its remote location. Access is often done with helicopter or ski-equipped plane (normally from Iceland).
