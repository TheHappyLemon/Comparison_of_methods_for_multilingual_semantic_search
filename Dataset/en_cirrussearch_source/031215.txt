The Tauber (German: [ˈtaʊbɐ]) is a river in Franconia (Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria), Germany. It is a left tributary of the Main and is 132 km (82 mi) in length. The name derives from the Celtic word for water (compare: Dover). It flows through Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Creglingen, Weikersheim, Bad Mergentheim, Königshofen, Tauberbischofsheim, and flows into the river Main in Wertheim am Main. The Tauber Valley Cycleway is a bicycle path which runs about 101 km along the course of the river. There is a medieval bridge over the river near Rothenburg ob der Tauber.
