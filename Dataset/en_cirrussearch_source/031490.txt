Arena Riga (Latvian: Arēna Rīga) is an indoor arena in Riga, Latvia. It is primarily used for ice hockey, basketball and concerts. Arena Riga holds a maximum of 14,500 and was opened on 15 February 2006. It was built to be used as one of the venues for the 2006 IIHF World Championship, the other being Skonto Arena. The arena was designed by the Canadian company SCI Architects and Latvian firms SIA Merks and SIA Nams. The 11,000-seat arena was constructed as a requirement for hosting the 2006 IIHF World Championship. Its construction overseen by Latvian Ice Hockey Federation president Kirovs Lipmans was delayed due to disagreements on the construction contract and finding an investor to fund the project. The Baltic Times reported that Lipmans was to blame for the delays, and that he was asked to resign for a conflict of interest in owning shares in the arena's management company. It has been home to the Latvian national ice hockey team ever since and the Kontinental Hockey League club Dinamo Riga since 2008, as well as the Latvian men's and women's national basketball teams since 2006. During the years the arena has also hosted many well-known artists from all over the world. A part of the events of the 2006 NATO Summit also took place in the venue. The arena hosted the matches of EuroBasket Women 2009, EuroBasket Women 2019 and 'D' group of Eurobasket 2015. The arena will host matches for the EuroBasket 2025 including the final phase. It will also host matches for the UEFA Futsal Euro 2026. 2006 IIHF World Championship Sensation White 2007 IIHF Continental Cup 2008 2008 IIHF World Junior Ice Hockey Championships – Division I EuroBasket Women 2009 Dinamo Riga vs. Phoenix Coyotes 2010 2011 FIBA Under-19 World Championship 2012 Kontinental Hockey League All-Star Game 2013 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship 8th World Choir Games 2014 EuroBasket 2015 2016 European Wrestling Championships 2016 Men's World Floorball Championships Eurovision Choir of the Year 2017 World Boxing Super Series 2017–18, 2018–19 2018 IIHF World U18 Championships – Division I A 2018 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship 2019 UEFA Under-19 Futsal Championship EuroBasket Women 2019 (partially held in Serbia) 2019 Fed Cup ( Latvia vs  Germany) 2021 IIHF World Championship 2021 FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup 2022 UEFA Futsal Champions League Finals 2023 Davis Cup ( Latvia vs  Israel) 2023 IIHF World Championship (partially held in Finland) EuroBasket 2025 UEFA Futsal Euro 2026 2Cellos 50 Cent Thirty Seconds to Mars A-ha Adam Tensta Al Bano Alla Pugacheva Apocalyptica Avril Lavigne Backstreet Boys Bastille Billy Idol Björk Bryan Adams Bonnie Tyler Chris Norman Chris Rea Citi Zēni Combichrist David Guetta DDT Deep Purple Depeche Mode Dmitri Hvorostovsky Ed Sheeran Elena Vaenga Elton John Enrique Iglesias Eric Clapton Eros Ramazzotti Faithless Glenn Miller Orchestra Gojira Golden Ring Gotan Project Gregorian Grigory Leps Gustavo Hurts Iggy and The Stooges Imagine Dragons Instrumenti Iron Maiden James Blunt James Brown Jean Michel Jarre Katie Melua Katy Perry KISS Korn Kylie Minogue Lana Del Rey Lenny Kravitz Limp Bizkit Linkin Park Lou Reed Louis Tomlinson Luis Fonsi MakSim Mariah Carey Marilyn Manson Mashina Vremeni Metallica Mika Mireille Mathieu Mumiy Troll Muse Nazareth Nikolay Baskov Nine Inch Nails Okean Elzy Ozzy Osbourne Patricia Kaas Paul Mauriat Pet Shop Boys Philipp Kirkorov Pink Placebo Redfoo Prāta Vētra Queen + Paul Rodgers R.E.M.
