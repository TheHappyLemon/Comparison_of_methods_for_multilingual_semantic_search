Pierre Charles Bouvier MSC (born May 9, 1979) is a Canadian singer and musician best known for being the lead vocalist and studio bassist of the rock band Simple Plan. Bouvier was born to Réal and Louise Bouvier on May 9, 1979 in Montréal, Quebec. He has two older brothers, Jay and Jonathan.[citation needed] At a young age he began taking piano lessons and at 9 years old took up the guitar. Prior to deciding to become a musician Bouvier originally sought to be a marine biologist.[citation needed] He described his childhood as good and remained close to his family.[citation needed] He attended Collège Beaubois in Pierrefonds, Quebec, with bandmates Chuck Comeau, Jeff Stinco, and Sébastien Lefebvre. Before and partly during his early musical career, Bouvier worked as a cook at St-Hubert in Montréal.[citation needed] When Bouvier was 13 or 14 years old, he founded the punk rock band Reset with his best friend Chuck Comeau in which he was the bass guitarist and lead vocalist. He was not happy with Reset and left the band in 1999, a year after Comeau's departure in 1998. His former bandmate David Desrosiers took his place as lead vocalist and bass guitarist. He later met Comeau at a Sugar Ray concert and joined him in creating Simple Plan with old schoolmates Desrosiers, Jeff Stinco, and Sébastien Lefebvre. He hosted the MTV reality show Damage Control. Bouvier owns a collection of Takamine acoustic guitars, the brand he uses on every album and while playing live. He also plays Fender electric guitars. Since 2020, he has served as bass guitarist and lead singer following the departure of David Desrosiers.
