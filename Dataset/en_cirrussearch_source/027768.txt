The Finnish Wikipedia (Finnish: Suomenkielinen Wikipedia) is the edition of Wikipedia in the Finnish language. By article count, it is the 27th largest Wikipedia with about 570,000 articles as of April 2024. Wikipedia is the only encyclopedia in Finnish which is still updated. The Finnish language project was started in late 2002, but it remained at a very primitive stage until well into 2003. The speed of development picked up somewhat after the MediaWiki software was upgraded to Phase III in late November 2003, and continued to increase steadily through 2004. In 2013, the reliability of the Finnish Wikipedia was investigated by the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. The researchers used experts to evaluate quality of randomly selected 134 articles and found that 70% of the articles scored well for accuracy. 500,000 articles – December 28, 2020 450,000 articles – January 12, 2019 400,000 articles – August 29, 2016 350,000 articles – July 9, 2014 300,000 articles – June 26, 2012 250,000 articles – September 24, 2010 200,000 articles – April 12, 2009 150,000 articles – February 4, 2008 100,000 articles – February 11, 2007 50,000 articles – February 21, 2006 15,000 articles – February 9, 2005 5,000 articles – April 15, 2004 1,000 articles – September, 2002 Finnish Wikipedia's 400,000 article logo (29 August 2016) Oldest article that has survived "List of Wikipedias". meta.wikimedia.org.
