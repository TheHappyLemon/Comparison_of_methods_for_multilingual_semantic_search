Hippodrome is a term sometimes used for public entertainment venues of various types. A modern example is the Hippodrome which opened in London in 1900 "combining circus, hippodrome, and stage performances". It is derived from the ancient Greek hippodromos (Greek: ἱππόδρομος), a stadium for horse racing and chariot racing. The name is derived from the Greek words hippos (ἵππος; "horse") and dromos (δρόμος; "course"). The ancient Roman version, the circus, was similar to the Greek hippodrome. One end of the ancient Greek hippodromos was semicircular, and the other end square with an extensive portico, in front of which, at a lower level, were the stalls for the horses and chariots. At both ends of the hippodrome were posts (Greek termata) that the chariots turned around. This was the most dangerous part of the track and the Greeks put an altar to Taraxippus (disturber of horses) there to show the spot where many chariots wrecked. It was built on the slope of a hill if possible and the ground taken from one side served to form the embankment on the other side.[citation needed] Delos Delphi Isthmia Lageion Mount Lykaion Nemea Olympia Aphrodisias Caesarea Maritima Circus Maximus Gerasa Hippodrome of Berytus Hippodrome of Constantinople Hippodrome of Thessalonica Tyre Hippodrome Miróbriga (Mirobriga Celticorum) Roman circus of Mérida Roman Stadium of Philippopolis List of horse racing venues Other structures called hippodromes: Hippodrome du parc de Beyrouth Kensington Hippodrome Madison Square Garden (1879).
