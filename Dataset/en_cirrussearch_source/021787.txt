Bellingshausen Island is one of the most southerly of the South Sandwich Islands, close to Thule Island and Cook Island, and forming part of the Southern Thule group. It is named after its discoverer, Russian Antarctic explorer Fabian von Bellingshausen (1778–1852). The island is a basaltic andesite stratovolcano, and the latest crater, about 152 metres (500 ft) across and 61 metres (200 ft) deep, formed explosively some time between 1968 and 1984. Its highest point, at 255 metres (837 ft), is Basilisk Peak. Its southeast point is called Isaacson Point; first charted by Discovery Investigations personnel on the Discovery II in 1930 and named for Ms. S. M. Isaacson, an assistant to the staff of the Discovery Committee. Hardy Point List of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands Salamander Point "Isaacson Point". Geographic Names Information System.
