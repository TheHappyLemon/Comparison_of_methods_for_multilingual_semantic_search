Stage 6 Films, Inc. is an American film production label of Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions that acquires and produces feature films that are low budget and that are being released direct-to-disc, on demand, or through streaming services. Some of their films are also being released theatrically. Once a film is finished, Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions will decide if the film will be released theatrically or on a different platform. Founded in 2007, the label takes its name from the location of its main office, the Stage 6 building at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, CA (originally an actual sound stage used for such films as The Wizard of Oz). Stage 6 occasionally also acquires international rights to films, be it worldwide excluding the United States and/or Canada, or in major territories such as the United Kingdom and Australia.
