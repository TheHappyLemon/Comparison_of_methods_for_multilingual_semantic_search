He has played in more than 80 important tournaments and won the Stockholm Elo Challenge in 2010, and was second in Rodrigo Memorial (Ferrol, Spain) in 2010. During the 2007 Vandœuvre Open in late December, Starostīts, falsely accused Anna Rudolf of cheating by hiding a computer in her lip balm. Starostīts in particular asked the arbiter to confiscate her belongings and refused to shake her hand before their game, the latter of which could have been penalized. Marie Boyarchenko, another player at the event, believed these actions were key factors in Rudolf losing that last-round game and cost her the championship. Starostīts has never apologized for his behavior towards Rudolf.
