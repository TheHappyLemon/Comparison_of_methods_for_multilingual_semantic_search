The 2017 BinckBank Tour was a road cycling stage race that took place between 7 and 13 August in the Netherlands and Belgium. It was a continuation of the Eneco Tour but was renamed following a change in title sponsor. As such, it was the 13th edition, the first one under the name BinckBank Tour. It was also the 29th event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. It was won by Tom Dumoulin. All UCI WorldTeam were invited as the race is part of the UCI World Tour. The race organisation also gave out wildcards to four UCI Professional Continental teams.

The first of these is the general classification, calculated by adding up the time each rider took to ride each stage. Time bonuses are applied for winning stages (10, 6 and 4 seconds to the first three riders) and for the three "golden kilometre" sprints on each stage. At each of these sprints, the first three riders are given 3-, 2- and 1-second bonuses respectively. The rider with the lowest cumulative time is the winner of the general classification. The rider leading the classification wins a green jersey. There is also a points classification. On each road stage the riders are awarded points for finishing in the top 10 places, with other points awarded for intermediate sprints. The rider with the most accumulated points is the leader of the classification and wins the blue jersey. The combativity classification is based solely on points won at the intermediate sprints; the leading rider wins the black jersey. The final classification is a team classification: on each stage the times of the best three riders on each team are added up. The team with the lowest cumulative time over the seven stages wins the team classification. "UCI expands WorldTour to 37 events". Cycling News. Retrieved 2 October 2016.
