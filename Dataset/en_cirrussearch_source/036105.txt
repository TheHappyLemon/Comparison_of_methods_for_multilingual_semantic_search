Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Algeria accepted the convention on 24 June 1974. There are seven World Heritage Sites in Algeria, with a further six on the tentative list. The first site in Algeria added to the list was Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad, in 1980. The most recent site added was Kasbah of Algiers, which was listed in 1992. Of the seven sites on the list, six are listed for cultural significance while Tassili n'Ajjer is listed for both cultural and natural significance. From 2002 to 2006, Tipasa was listed as endangered because of inadequate management of the site, including vandalism, growing urbanisation in the buffer zone, and unsuitable restoration techniques. Algeria has served on the World Heritage Committee three times. UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural. In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Algeria maintains six properties on its tentative list.
