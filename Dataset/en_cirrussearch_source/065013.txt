Eurojackpot is a transnational European lottery launched in March 2012. As of March 2024, the countries participating in the lottery are: Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain Sweden, and Greece. The jackpot starts at €10,000,000 and can roll over up to €120,000,000. Playing the Eurojackpot costs €2 per line (except in Lithuania which includes additional game called 'Joker' that increases the price to €3 per line; buying a base ticket without Joker is not an option and in Greece where its costs €2,50 per line). The goal is to match 5 correct numbers out of 50 plus another 2 supplementary numbers out of another 12; the odds of winning the jackpot are 1:140,000,000. There are 12 tiers of prizes for Eurojackpot. The lottery draw takes place every Tuesday and Friday at 21:00 local time in Helsinki. The evaluation of the winning lottery tickets is done in Germany and Denmark. All odds are rounded to the decimal point. Up to January 31, 2013 the Eurojackpot lottery had a 'rolldown' clause: in case the jackpot is not won for 12 consecutive draws, the 13th draw will be subject to a rolldown whereby if no winner is able to match all 7 winning numbers, the jackpot is paid out to the next winning tier where a winner is available. It was this clause that set the previous jackpot record of 27,545,857.50 Euros in August 2012, as a German player who correctly matched the 5 main numbers, but only one of the Euronumbers (out of two), walked away with the jackpot in the second prize tier. For the groups except the first one, the winning amounts are calculated nationally, and they can vary by country based on number of winners, lottery tax and other reasons. Accurate as of 09-03-2024 The maximum jackpot of €120 million was reached for the first time on Tuesday 19th July 2022. Nobody won in that draw, but a player from Denmark did win in the following draw on Friday 22nd July. The second largest jackpot was set on May 20, 2022, when a 15-player syndicate from Germany won €110 million. This prize was the first jackpot over €90 million to be won following Eurojackpot's rule changes in March 2022, which increased the jackpot cap to €120 million. The previous record, and cap, was 90,000,000.00 Euro. This sum was first won on May 15, 2015 where a person from Czech Republic won the 90,000,000.00 Euro jackpot. The first event when multiple players have won the same divided jackpot was on 7 January 2017. For the first time, five people (one from each German federal states of Berlin, Niedersachsen and Hessen, with a winner from Denmark and one from the Netherlands) won 18,000,000.00 Euro after a week when the maximum Jackpot with 90,000,000.00 Euro hadn't been drawn. It was followed by the next multiple 5+2 win on 10 February, when a Hungarian player won the country's biggest-ever lottery prize (overtaking the most famous 5/90 Ötöslottó's record with 5092 million Forint, which was 19˙216˙280,26 Euro as in the currency of 28 November 2003). A Finnish syndicate of 50 players from Siilinjärvi, who had played a system ticket with 4 predictions in the 7/3 system mode for a total amount of 504.00 Euro, won on August 23, 2019 the maximum jackpot amount plus further winnings from the lower prize categories thus the record win of 91,938,695.00 Euro (84,174,472.21 GBP).

The Eurojackpot lottery was proposed in 2006, to compete with the EuroMillions lottery. By virtue of a large number of participating countries, the EuroMillions is able to offer considerably larger jackpots than those offered in a single national lottery. After seeing the success of EuroMillions, Germany, Finland, Denmark, Slovenia, Italy and the Netherlands met in Amsterdam in November 2011 to complete the negotiations for the Eurojackpot lottery and to begin the roll out in 2012.
