Hissaro-Alay is located west of the Pamirs, between the Fergana Valley in the north, the Karshi Steppe, the Tajik Depression and the Alay Valley in the south. The eastern part of the system is located on the territory of Kyrgyzstan, the middle - in Tajikistan and the western - in Uzbekistan. The length of Hissaro-Alai from west to east is about 900 km (560 mi), the width in the western part is up to 150 km (93 mi), and in the east up to 80 km (50 mi). Neolithic cultures, such as Hissar have inhabited the Hissaro-Alay mountain area between 6-2 millennia BCE whose economy consisted of sheep and goat pastoralism. source: Taylor, William T.
