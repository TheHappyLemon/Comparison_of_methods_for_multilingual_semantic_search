Myjava (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈmijaʋa]; historically also Miava, German: Miawa, Hungarian: Miava) is a town in Trenčín Region, Slovakia. It is located in the Myjava Hills at the foothills of the White Carpathians and nearby the Little Carpathians. The river Myjava flows through the town. It is 10 km away from the Czech border, 35 km from Skalica and 100 km from Bratislava. The settlement was established in 1533 and was colonized by two groups of inhabitants: refugees fleeing from the Ottomans in southern Upper Hungary (today mostly Slovakia) and inhabitants from north-western and northern Upper Hungary. During the Revolutions of 1848, the first Slovak National Council met in the town as a result of the Slovak Uprising. Today, the house of their meeting is now part of the Museum of the Slovak National Councils, a part of the Slovak National Museum network. According to the 2001 census, 95.5% of the inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.5% Czechs and 0.4% Roma. The religious makeup was 51.4% Lutherans, 28.2% people with no religious affiliation and 14.2% Roman Catholics.
