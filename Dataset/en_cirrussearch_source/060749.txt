The 2022 IIHF World Championship Division II was an international ice hockey tournament run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The Group A tournament was held in Zagreb, Croatia from 25 to 30 April and the Group B tournament in Reykjavík, Iceland from 18 to 23 April 2022. After the tournament was cancelled the two previous years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all teams stayed put in their respective groups. China won Group A and got promoted to Division IB, while Iceland won Group B and got promoted to Group A. In order to fill each group of the World Championships back to their normal amount of teams, the IIHF made the decision following the tournament not to relegate Israel or Mexico, who finished last in Groups A and B respectively, but instead to promote the Netherlands and Georgia, the runners-up of each group. Three referees and five linesmen are selected for the tournament.
