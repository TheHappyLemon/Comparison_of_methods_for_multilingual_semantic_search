36 (thirty-six) is the natural number following 35 and preceding 37. 36 is both the square of six, and the eighth triangular number or the sum of the first eight non-zero positive integers, which makes 36 the first non-trivial square triangular number. Aside from being the smallest square triangular number other than 1, it is also the only triangular number (other than 1) whose square root is also a triangular number. 36 is also the eighth refactorable number, as it has exactly nine positive divisors, and 9 is one of them; in fact, it is the smallest number with exactly nine divisors, which leads 36 to be the 7th highly composite number. It is the sum of the fourth pair of twin-primes (17 + 19), and the 18th Harshad number in decimal, as it is divisible by the sum of its digits (9). It is the smallest number n{\displaystyle n} with exactly eight solutions (37, 57, 63, 74, 76, 108, 114, 126) to the Euler totient function ϕ(x)=n{\displaystyle \phi (x)=n}. Adding up some subsets of its divisors (e.g., 6, 12, and 18) gives 36; hence, it is also the eighth semiperfect number. This number is the sum of the cubes of the first three positive integers and also the product of the squares of the first three positive integers. 36 is the number of degrees in the interior angle of each tip of a regular pentagram.
