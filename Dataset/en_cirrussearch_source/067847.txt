The result was also the first away victory for a CFU team over a European side on their home soil. In October 2016, it reached its highest ranking in the FIFA world ranking (73rd place) thanks to its good performance in the 2nd round of the 2017 Caribbean Cup of Nations qualifiers.[citation needed] However, two defeats against French Guiana (0–1) and Haiti at home (0–2 a.e.t.) stopped the Sugar Boyz in the 3rd round of these qualifiers.[citation needed] The year ends with a 1–1 draw in Basseterre against Estonia on November 19, 2016, in a friendly match, one year after playing against the same team in Tallinn.[citation needed] In June 2017, the team went on a second European tour and played Armenia on June 4 in Yerevan[citation needed] and Georgia three days later in Tbilisi.[citation needed] Both games ended in equally bad losses, 5–0 and 3–0, respectively.[citation needed] St. Kitts and Nevis continues its pattern of international tours and travels in August 2017 to Mumbai to meet Mauritius and India in a friendly tournament, the 2017 Hero Tri-Nation Series.[citation needed] Both matches ended in draws acquired by the same score of one goal each.[citation needed] The Sugar Boyz played Andorra again on March 25, 2022, six and a half years after their first confrontation, for a friendly match in Andorra la Vella.[citation needed] This time the Principality's selection wins against Saint Kitts and Nevis on its home stadium (1–0).[citation needed] They qualified for their first ever CONCACAF Gold Cup in 2023.[citation needed] The following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.   Win   Draw   Loss   Fixture Saint Kitts and Nevis  v  Aruba Curaçao  v  Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Kitts and Nevis  v  French Guiana Trinidad and Tobago  v  Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Kitts and Nevis  v  United States Jamaica  v  Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Kitts and Nevis  v  Guadeloupe Saint Lucia  v  Saint Kitts and Nevis Sint Maarten  v  Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Kitts and Nevis  v  Sint Maarten Saint Kitts and Nevis  v  Saint Lucia Guadeloupe  v  Saint Kitts and Nevis San Marino  v  Saint Kitts and Nevis San Marino  v  Saint Kitts and Nevis Costa Rica  v  Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Kitts and Nevis  v  Bahamas Trinidad and Tobago  v  Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Kitts and Nevis  v  Grenada Carlos Cavagnaro (1988) Alistair Edwards (1996–1997) Ces Podd (1999–2000) Clinton Percival (2000–2001) Elvis Browne (2002–2004) Lenny Lake (2004) Leonard Taylor (2008) Lester Morris (2008) Lenny Lake (2008–2010) Clinton Percival (2010–2012) Jeffrey Hazel (2012–2015) Jacques Passy (2015–2019) Earl Jones (2019) Claudio Caimi (2019–2021) Leonardo Neiva (2021) Austin Huggins (2022–) The following players were called up for the friendlies against San Marino on 20 and 24 March 2024.
