Artūrs Silagailis (born 3 May 1987) is a retired Latvian football defender. Currently he works as a youth coach at his hometown club Blāzma. Silagailis began his career in the local club Dižvanagi Rēzekne (later renamed SK Blāzma). In February 2009 he signed a contract with FC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih. He made his first-team debut in a league match against the famous FC Shakhtar Donetsk. He found it difficult to find a place in the starting line-up, so he left the team on loan to FK Ventspils in March 2010. In August 2010 he signed a contract with KF Tirana in Albanian Superliga. Due to the delayed salary payment he left the team in December, the same year, signing a one-year contract with an option to extend it for another season with FC Gomel, playing in the Belarusian Premier League. Just 3 months after signing with FC Gomel, Silagailis left the club, signing for another Belarusian Premier League club Dnepr Mogilev. From 2007 to 2008 Silagailis played for Latvia U-21, but he hasn't been capped for the senior side. His brother Guntars is also a former professional footballer.
