The villages of Březovec, Drahotice, Libáň, Nová Ves, Obořice, Ochoz and Podlíšťany are administrative parts of Nasavrky. Nasavrky is located about 11 kilometres (7 mi) south of Chrudim and 20 km (12 mi) south of Pardubice. It lies in the Iron Mountains and partly in the eponymous protected landscape area. The highest point is at 564 m (1,850 ft) above sea level. The area is rich in small fishponds. The first written mention of Nasavrky is from 1318. Bishop Jan Očko of Vlašim acquired the village in 1355. During his rule, in 1360, Nasavrky was promoted to a town. From 1746 to 1942, Nasavrky was owned by a branch of the Auersperg family. The I/37 road, which connects Hradec Králové and Pardubice with the D1 motorway, passes through the town. The Church of Saint Giles was built in the Gothic style in the 14th century. After a fire in 1740, Baroque modifications were made. The Nasavrky Castle is a late Renaissance building from around 1600. It was built on the site of an old Gothic fortress. It has a valuable entrance hall with Renaissance portals. Originally it served as a summer residence of the Auersperg family, later there were apartments and offices. Today it serves cultural and social purposes and there is an exposition about the life of the Celts. Země keltů (Land of Celts) is an open-air museum presenting life in a Celtic settlement, which was once in the territory of the Iron Mountains. "Population of Municipalities – 1 January 2023".
