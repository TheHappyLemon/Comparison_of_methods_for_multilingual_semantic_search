Maguindanao del Sur, officially the Province of Maguindanao del Sur (Maguindanaon: Dairat nu Salatan Magindanaw, Jawi:دايرت نو سلاتان مڬیندانو ), is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in Mindanao. Its capital is the municipality of Buluan near the city of Tacurong in the neighboring province of Sultan Kudarat.

However an issue arose since the determination of the first set of officials of the province presumes that the plebiscite was held prior to the 2022 national and local elections. However the plebiscite was postponed to a date after the elections. This led to the Commission on Elections to come up with a legal opinion. The position was issued on September 28, 2022, where the election body conclude that only the Department of the Interior and Local Government could appoint the first officials of the province. Mangudadatu would assume the position and take oath as governor of the new province in October 13, 2022.
