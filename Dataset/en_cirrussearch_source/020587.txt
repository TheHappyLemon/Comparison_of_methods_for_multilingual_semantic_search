Pieter Weening (born 5 April 1981) is a Dutch former professional road bicycle racer, who rode professionally for the Rabobank (2004–2011), Orica–GreenEDGE (2012–2015), Roompot–Charles (2016–2019), and Trek–Segafredo (2020) teams. Weening was born in Harkema, Friesland. In 2005 Weening won a stage in the Tour de France. After one of the closest finishes in the Tour ever, Weening won the eighth stage just ahead of Andreas Klöden. In the same year he also won a stage in the Tour de Pologne and finished second overall, five seconds behind winner Kim Kirchen. He was named Dutch cyclist of 2005. With only a stage win in the Tour of Austria, Weening had to wait six years before a next big victory. In the Giro d'Italia, just one day after the neutralised stage due to the death of Wouter Weylandt, Weening won stage 5. Analysts described this stage as a 'Mini Tour of Lombardy'. The stage had an uphill finish and several unpaved stretches (strade bianche). Weening was the strongest on the uphill finish of a small break away and stayed just in front of the peloton. After the stage win, he was awarded the Pink leaders jersey. He gave the physical jersey awarded to him on the podium to Weylandt's family. On 10 August 2011, and after eight seasons with Rabobank, Weening left the team to join the new GreenEDGE squad for its inaugural season in 2012. In 2013, Weening won the Tour de Pologne after starting the time trial fifth overall, and 27 seconds down. He managed to take the lead by placing a solid performance. In 2014, Weening again won a stage in the Giro d'Italia, after also being part of the team that won the first-stage team time trial. On stage 9, he took part in the day's main breakaway and, along with Davide Malacarne (Team Europcar), was able to stay away to the end of the stage. He outsprinted Malacarne in the closing metres, to take the third individual stage win of his career. Weening also won the Giro della Toscana from a solo attack. After Roompot–Charles disbanded at the end of the 2019 season, Weening signed with Trek–Segafredo on 5 June 2020, marking his return to the UCI World Tour after four years at the UCI Professional Continental level. His short-term contract was not extended beyond the 2020 season, and Weening announced his retirement that November. 2001 7th Overall Grand Prix Guillaume Tell 2002 1st Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships 2nd GP Wielerrevue 6th Overall Tour de l'Avenir 10th Overall Circuit des Ardennes 2003 1st Overall Jadranska Magistrala 1st Stage 2 3rd La Côte Picarde 3rd Liège–Bastogne–Liège U23 9th Overall Tour of Austria 10th Overall Niedersachsen Rundfahrt 2005 1st Stage 8 Tour de France 2nd Overall Tour de Pologne 1st Stage 6 9th Overall Vuelta a Murcia 2006 8th Overall Critérium International 2008 1st Ridderronde Maastricht 7th Overall Regio-Tour 2009 3rd Overall Vuelta a Murcia 4th Overall Tour de Pologne 6th Overall Tour of Austria 1st Stage 3 2010 2nd Road race, National Road Championships 5th Overall Ster Elektrotoer 8th Overall Vuelta a Murcia 10th Overall Tour of Austria 2011 Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 5 Held after Stages 5–8 6th Overall Tour de Romandie 2012 10th Overall Tour of California 2013 1st Overall Tour de Pologne 2nd Overall Tour de Langkawi 2nd Grand Prix Impanis-Van Petegem 6th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 8th Overall Eneco Tour 8th Amstel Gold Race 8th Amstel Curaçao Race 9th Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 2014 Giro d'Italia 1st Stages 1 (TTT) & 9 1st Giro di Toscana 2015 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Giro d'Italia 2016 1st Overall Tour of Norway 1st Stage 2 1st Stage 6 Tour de Suisse 6th Overall Tour des Fjords 2017 1st Mountains classification Tour de Yorkshire 1st Mountains classification Tour of Austria 3rd Overall Tour of Norway 1st Stage 3 6th Trofeo Pollenca–Port de Andratx 7th Overall Danmark Rundt 9th Vuelta a Murcia 2018 1st Stage 5 Tour of Austria 2nd Overall Tour of Croatia 6th Overall Adriatica Ionica Race 8th Overall Okolo Slovenska 2019 1st Stage 2 Tour de Luxembourg 4th Trofeo Andratx–Lloseta 5th Classic Sud-Ardèche 8th Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 10th Overall Tour of Belgium Aubrey, Jane (10 August 2011).
