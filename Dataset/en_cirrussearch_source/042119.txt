Marc Soler Giménez (born 22 November 1993) is a Spanish cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam UAE Team Emirates. Soler was born in Vilanova i la Geltru. In 2017, Soler finished third overall behind team mate Alejandro Valverde and Alberto Contador in the Volta a Catalunya, winning the young rider's classification. Later that year was named in the startlist for the Vuelta a España. In March 2018, he won the Paris–Nice stage race. Having started the final stage 37 seconds down on race leader Simon Yates (Mitchelton–Scott) in sixth place overall, Soler attacked around halfway into the stage along with compatriot David de la Cruz (Team Sky); the duo joined Omar Fraile (Astana) at the head of the race, and the trio managed to stay clear of the rest of the field by the time they reached Nice. As de la Cruz and Fraile contested stage honours, Soler finished third – acquiring four bonus seconds on the finish in addition to three gained at an earlier intermediate sprint – and with a 35-second gap to Yates and the remaining general classification contenders, it was enough to give Soler victory over Yates by four seconds. In June 2021, Soler was forced to abandon the 2021 Tour de France, after being involved in a crash on the opening stage and suffering fractures to both arms' radial heads and his left ulnar head. 2013 1st Stage 3 Vuelta a Palencia 2014 1st Soraluzeko Saria 1st Ereñoko Udala Sari Nagusia 1st Grand Prix Kutxabank 1st Memorial Cirilo Zunzarren 1st Stage 3 Vuelta a Zamora 3rd Time trial, National Under-23 Road Championships 2015 1st Overall Tour de l'Avenir 6th Klasika Primavera 2016 (1 pro win) 2nd Overall Route du Sud 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 4 7th Circuito de Getxo 2017 3rd Overall Volta a Catalunya 1st Young rider classification 4th Time trial, National Road Championships 5th GP Miguel Induráin 8th Overall Tour de Suisse Combativity award Stage 9 Vuelta a España 2018 (1) 1st Overall Paris–Nice 1st Young rider classification 3rd Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 5th Overall Volta a Catalunya 6th Overall Vuelta a Aragón 6th GP Miguel Induráin 2019 8th Overall Vuelta a Aragón 9th Overall Vuelta a España 2020 (2) 1st Pollença–Andratx Vuelta a España 1st Stage 2 Combativity award Stages 11, 14 & 17 8th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 2021 (1) 4th Overall Tour de Romandie 1st Stage 3 2022 (1) Vuelta a España 1st Stage 5 Combativity award Stage 5 & Overall 7th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 2023 4th Overall Volta a Catalunya 2024 1st Stage 3 (TTT) Paris–Nice 9th Trofeo Pollença–Port d'Andratx 10th Clásica Jaén Paraíso Interior "Marc Soler".
