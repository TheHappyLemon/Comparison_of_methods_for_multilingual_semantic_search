Before the First Partition of the First Polish Republic in 1772, there was a non-town Kościerzyna County Council. During the Prussian partition in 1818–1919, the Prussian district "Landkreis Berent" functioned. In the years 1920-1939 (the Second Polish Republic) and 1945-1975 (PRL) there was a Kościerzyna Land District. In the period of September 1939 - February / March 1945, the area of the county was under German occupation. In 1920, the county granted to Poland covered the area of 117,698 ha and was smaller than its Prussian counterpart of 6,301 ha, which left for the Free City of Gdańsk (villages of Częstocin, Trzepowo, Gromadzin, Czarna Huta, Borowina, Olszanka, Sucha Huta, and Pawłowo). The county is subdivided into eight gminas (one urban and seven rural). These are listed in the following table, in descending order of population. GUS. "Population.
