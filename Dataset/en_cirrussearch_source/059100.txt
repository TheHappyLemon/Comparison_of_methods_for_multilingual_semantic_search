It was founded by former members of the Riga City Council Aleksejs Roslikovs and Valērijs Petrovs. It is a party that advocates Russian minority politics, and it describes itself as centrist on the political spectrum. The party organized multiple protests in 2021 against mandatory vaccination and restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The For Stability - Yes! group was founded in the winter of 2021. It was founded by two former Riga councilors elected from the list of the Social Democratic Party "Harmony": Aleksejs Rosļikovs and Valērijs Petrovs. In the early 2020 Riga City Council election, both councilors stood on the list of the Alternative party, which did not win seats in the council. At the end of the ten days set aside for collecting signatures, a total of 315 people participated in the founding of the party. At the time of its founding, the party had 647 members. The party's establishment was voted unanimously, and the party was officially founded on 26 February 2021. The group's leaders emphasized that they would build a political party free of sponsors, which would contribute to the stabilization of the state as its main task. They also announced that they would run in the local elections in 2021. They chose Law and Order and the Republic as the closest groups. The party ran in the 2022 Latvian parliamentary election.

The party's logo and initial abbreviation was the letter S with an exclamation point. The choice of the logo received a lot of criticism, especially in Sigulda, for the similarity of the logo with Sigulda's trademark "S!gulda aizrauj". Since Sigulda's trademark is 12 years older than the party, the court decided to ban the party "For Stability!" to use the trademark S! in economic circulation, including in advertising and online, without the permission of the municipality of Sigulda region. Until December 2023, the party used the long version of the logo with the full name of the party before changing it to the current "ST!" one.
