Since the 2012–13 NHL season all teams not qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs have a "weighted" chance at winning the first overall selection. Beginning with the 2014–15 NHL season the NHL changed the weighting system that was used in previous years. Under the new system the odds of winning the draft lottery for the four lowest finishing teams in the league decreased, while the odds for the other non-playoff teams increased. The first three picks overall in this draft were awarded by lottery on April 9, 2019. The New Jersey Devils, New York Rangers and Chicago Blackhawks won the lotteries that took place on April 9, 2019, giving them the first, second and third picks overall.
