While appearing in Sweet Charity, Applegate broke her foot and it was announced that the musical would close during previews. She persuaded the producers to change their minds. Because of her injury, she had to wear special shoes to prevent another accident. In a 2013 interview, she said that because of what happened, she "actually can't dance anymore. And that is sad for me because I always wanted to go back. But I probably won't be able to." She does dance whenever the opportunity presents, but cannot perform in strenuous roles. In 2006, Applegate appeared in Jessica Simpson's music video for "A Public Affair" with Eva Longoria, Ryan Seacrest, and Christina Milian. She starred in the ABC comedy Samantha Who? from October 15, 2007, until it was cancelled on May 18, 2009; the finale aired on July 23, 2009.

Applegate starred in the NBC sitcom Up All Night with Maya Rudolph and Will Arnett, which debuted on September 14, 2011. On February 8, 2013, she left the series after its second-season hiatus, which was leading into a planned format change. The series was ultimately cancelled. On July 31, 2013, Applegate was featured on the second episode of the fourth season of the revived American version of the TLC series Who Do You Think You Are?. The episode centered on Applegate trying to find information about her paternal grandmother, Lavina Applegate Walton, who was absent for most of Applegate's father's life and died when he was young. Applegate learned that Walton died in 1955 from tuberculosis and alcohol-related cirrhosis. In 2013, Applegate reprised her role as Veronica Corningstone in the comedy sequel film Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues. The film received positive reviews from critics and was a box office success. In 2014, she had a starring voice role as Mary Beth in the animated musical fantasy film The Book of Life.

The film was poorly reviewed, but was a box office success. In 2016, she starred as Gwendolyn James in the comedy film Bad Moms with Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn. The film earned mixed reviews from critics and was a box office success. She reprised her role for a cameo appearance in the November 2017 sequel A Bad Moms Christmas. In July 2018, Applegate co-starred with Linda Cardellini in the Netflix dark comedy series Dead to Me and executive produced the series with Will Ferrell, Adam McKay, and Jessica Elbaum. The series received critical acclaim. Applegate received two nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance in seasons one and two and nominations for a Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and TCA Award. On November 14, 2022, she received a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was accompanied by her Married With Children co-stars Katey Sagal and David Faustino. Her star was placed adjacent to Sagal and Ed O'Neill's stars. In 2024, Applegate began a podcast with fellow actress with MS Jamie-Lynn Sigler called MeSsy about their friendship based on the condition. Applegate married actor Johnathon Schaech in Palm Springs, California on October 20, 2001. Schaech filed for divorce in December 2005, citing irreconcilable differences, and the divorce was finalized in August 2007. She began dating Dutch musician Martyn LeNoble in 2009. The couple became engaged on Valentine's Day 2010 and married on February 23, 2013, at their Los Angeles home. It was the second marriage for both. They have one daughter, born in January 2011. People reported in 2008 that Applegate had been diagnosed with breast cancer. A representative stated, "Christina Applegate was diagnosed with an early stage of breast cancer. Detected early through a doctor-ordered MRI, the cancer was not life-threatening. Christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery." It was announced that she was cancer-free after a double mastectomy, although cancer had been found in only one breast. She has an inherited genetic trait, a BRCA1 mutation, which can trigger breast and ovarian cancer. Her mother is also a breast cancer survivor. Applegate said when she first was diagnosed, "I was just shaking and then, also immediately, I had to go into 'take-care-of-business mode,' which included a change to a more healthy diet." Applegate announced in August 2021 that she had received a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis a few months before. The disease heavily affected her ability to perform in the final season of Dead to Me, for whose success she credits her co-star Linda Cardellini and showrunner Liz Feldman's support and openness in making reasonable adjustments to her filming schedule. Applegate said in 2023 that because of her illness she probably would no longer act on camera, but that she would be open to voiceover work, such as a planned animated revival of Married... with Children. She would also consider working behind the scenes. Applegate has supported Entertainment Industry Foundation, Adopt-A-Classroom, The Motion Picture and Television Fund Foundation, World Animal Protection, and the Trevor Project. In 2003, she was the spokesman for the Lee National Denim Day, which raises millions of dollars for breast cancer education and research. Following her breast cancer diagnosis, she appeared on a television special, Stand Up to Cancer, designed to raise funds for breast cancer research. The one-hour special was broadcast on CBS, NBC and ABC television networks on September 5, 2008. In 2009, Applegate announced plans to return as the ambassador for Lee National Denim Day. Also in 2009, she founded Right Action for Women, a charitable foundation dedicated to breast-cancer screening for women and focused on the type of MRI scan that saved her life. In February 2015, she was awarded the Saint Vintage Love Cures Award at the 2nd annual unite4:humanity event hosted by Variety magazine for her dedication to and work with Right Action for Women.
