On 1 July 2010 Emma Green improved her personal best to 1.98 m when she won at the Sollentuna GP, beating her previous best which had lasted almost five years. Only one month later, on 1 August 2010, at the 2010 European Championships in Barcelona, she improved her personal best twice over within 5 minutes; first she jumped 1.99 and then just minutes later she jumped 2.01. This was her first time over the two-metre mark and was worth a European silver medal behind Blanka Vlašić – her first continental medal. She won the Folksam Grand Prix in Gothenburg later that month, jumping 1.95 m. Apart from being a world class high-jumper she has been a Swedish champion at the 100 m, 200m and long jump and is also a top national level triple jumper. She won a bronze medal in high jump at the 2012 European Athletics Championships in Helsinki on 28 June. In 2011 Green married her coach Yannick Tregaro, who was also the coach of high jumper Kajsa Bergqvist and triple jumper Christian Olsson. The couple announced their divorce in early 2014. She is a supporter of LGBT rights and painted her nails in rainbow colors during the 2013 World Championships in Moscow as an act of defiance against Russia's recent ban on gay propaganda.Yelena Isinbayeva condemned Green Tregaro's action at a press conference, but later clarified her views. The Swedish Olympic Committee subsequently cautioned their athletes against engaging in the same type of manifestation as Green Tregaro's at the upcoming Winter Olympics 2014.
