The Bay of Puck or Puck Bay (Polish: Zatoka Pucka; Kashubian: Pùckô Hôwinga; German: Putziger Wiek), is a shallow western branch of the Bay of Gdańsk in the southern Baltic Sea, off the shores of Gdańsk Pomerania, Poland. It is separated from the open sea by the Hel Peninsula. The bay has an average depth of 2 m (7 ft) to 6 m (20 ft). There is a shallow sand-bank from Rewa to Kuźnica in the middle of Hel Peninsula. The bay is available only for small fishing boats and yachts, which have to stick to the strict deeper routes. There are deposits of potassium salt below the Bay of Puck. The main ports are Puck, Jastarnia, and Hel. The name has nothing to do with the ice hockey, in Polish the word "puck" doesn't mean anything, and the sport is popular only in the southern part of the country, opposite to the coast.
