Brandis (German pronunciation: [ˈbʁandɪs]) is a town in the Leipzig district, in Saxony, Germany. It is situated 16 km east of Leipzig. Brandis developed as a village around Brandis manor house which still forms part of the historical center. Since the late 1990s, the city has been merged with a number of formerly independent villages, including Beucha and Polenz. Brandis is connected to the federal highway network via a network of local roads. In Beucha, the city is linked to the regional rail network with direct trains to Leipzig.
