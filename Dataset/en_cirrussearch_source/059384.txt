Dylan Groenewegen (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈdɪlən ˈɣrunəˌʋeːɣən]; born 21 June 1993) is a Dutch professional road racing cyclist, who rides for UCI WorldTeam Team Jayco–AlUla. He has won five individual Tour de France stages and one team time trial stage. He has also won the Dutch National Road Race Championships, five stages of the Tour of Norway, five stages of the Tour of Britain and three stages of Paris–Nice. In 2020, Groenewegen received considerable attention for causing a serious crash at the Tour de Pologne, which put Fabio Jakobsen in hospital, and for which Groenewegen received a nine-month ban from racing. Groenewegen was born to a working-class family in Amsterdam. His grandfather, Ko Zieleman (1933–2021), assembled custom bike frames of which Groenewegen received his first bike at the age of seven. Zieleman owned a shop selling bike frames, a trade that his father had started in 1928, which Groenewegen's father, Gerrie, has continued. At the age of 17, Groenewegen went to a trade school in order to follow his previous three generations as a frame-builder. Groenewegen said in an interview that he had to choose between Team Roompot or BMC Racing Team to join in 2014. He chose the former as they gave him "a lot of confidence". In October 2015, Groenewegen announced that he had signed with LottoNL–Jumbo, on an initial three-year deal from 2016. In June, Groenewegen won the Dutch National Road Race Championships after outsprinting Wouter Wippert. During a review of Groenewegen's Bianchi Oltre XR4 bicycle, Simon Richardson of Global Cycling Network said he is "a very easy rider to work with" in respect to the mechanics. Groenewegen won stage 4 of the Tour of Britain. In the Dubai Tour, which ran from late January into early February, Groenewegen came second in the general classification, having finished second in stages 1 and 2. Despite narrowly missing out on victory in these areas, he did win the overall youth classification. On 28 April, Groenewegen won the first stage of the Tour de Yorkshire. The stage, which was 174 kilometres (108 mi) long from Bridlington to Scarbrough, came down to a photo finish where he held off Australian sprinter Caleb Ewan. He came fourth on the second stage which finished in Harrogate. He continued this success when in May, he won two stages at the Tour of Norway. The Tour de France started well for Groenewegen when he came fifth on stage 2, the first flat stage. He produced two more top-10 results in the first week, with sixth in stages 6 and 7. After two mountain stages and a rest day in Dordogne, he returned to finish third on stage 10 – a 178 kilometres (111 mi) route from Périgueux to Bergerac. Groenewegen won the final stage of the race on the last stage on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. In February, Groenewegen competed in the Dubai Tour and won stage 1. Groenewegen held the general classification lead until the third stage when he was penalised 20 seconds after illegally drafting behind his team's car after suffering a mechanical fault. The blue jersey, given to the race leader, was lost to Elia Viviani who started the day two seconds behind Groenewegen, who dropped out of the top 10. He expressed his anger, saying "I had problems with my bike, the mechanicals fucked it up for me. I actually think it was a good decision by the judges but it fucked it up for me" before placing the blame on his mechanics, saying that "it's the fault of my mechanics". In the Tour de France, Groenewegen won stage 7 after beating Fernando Gaviria and Peter Sagan, both of whom had won two stages to that point in the tour. The stage was the longest in the tour at 231 km (143.5 mi) which started in Fougères and finished in Chartres, Northern France. Groenewegen also won stage 8, beating Sagan and John Degenkolb in Amiens. In an interview, Groenewegen said that the sprint was "a bit messy" but he said that he "surged ahead" and took advantage of the "good opportunity". In March, Groenewegen won the first two stages of Paris–Nice. On the second stage, he found himself at the head of the race in a group of 23 riders about 30 km (18.6 mi) from the finish line, and ended up winning the stage after another split left just 7 riders contesting for the win. Later in March, he won the Three Days of Bruges–De Panne, out sprinting Gaviria and Viviani after squeezing through a gap between Gaviria and the barrier in order to open up his sprint. Team Jumbo-Visma won the team time trial on stage 2 of the Tour de France, thus increasing the lead of Groenewegen's teammate, Mike Teunissen in the general classification. Groenwegen went on to win stage 7 of the Tour de France, the longest stage in the tour at 230 km (142.9 mi) finishing in Chalon-sur-Saône. He beat Caleb Ewan and Sagan, giving him his fourth Tour de France stage win. Groenewegen won stages 1, 3 and 5 of the Tour of Britain, beating Davide Cimolai, Mathieu van der Poel, and Matthew Walls on the respective stages. Groenewegen's 2020 season started well, with victories on stages 1 and 3 as well as the points classification of the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana. Groenewegen had further success in the UAE Tour, winning stage 4 on 26 February. He beat Fernando Gaviria and Pascal Ackermann to the finish in Dubai after 173 km. During stage 1 of the Tour de Pologne in Katowice, Poland on 5 August, Groenewegen pushed Fabio Jakobsen into the barriers surrounding the finish line causing a very serious crash that put his rival in hospital and eventually in a medically induced coma. Groenewegen crashed as well and suffered a broken collarbone. More riders were involved in the crash; French sprinter Marc Sarreau had to abandon the race due to his injuries resulting from the crash. Groenewegen was disqualified from the race and fined CHF 500. Jakobsen's directeur sportif Patrick Lefevere said at the time that his team were considering bringing criminal charges against Groenewegen. In November 2020, Groenewegen was handed a nine-month ban for causing the crash, backdated to the day of the incident, meaning the ban ended on 7 May 2021. The previous month, Jakobsen had to undergo facial surgery where his jaw was reconstructed and bone was transplanted. Both Groenewegen and his team Jumbo-Visma apologized and took responsibility, with Groenewegen saying he "deviated from [his] line" and also that he wanted to be a "fair sprinter". In December 2021, Groenewegen signed a three-year contract with Australian UCI WorldTeam Team BikeExchange–Jayco from 2022 season. Early in the season he won stages in several smaller races including the Tour de Hongrie, the Tour of Slovenia as well as the 2022 Saudi Tour where he won two stages and the points classification. In the 2022 Tour de France he won stage 3, his first victory at the Tour since 2019. As of 2017, Groenewegen lives in Rivierenbuurt, a district in Amsterdam. 2011 1st Stage 1 Driedaagse van Axel 1st Stage 3 Liège–La Gleize 2nd Road race, National Junior Road Championships 2nd Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne Juniores 2012 3rd Münsterland Giro 4th Nationale Sluitingsprijs 9th Dutch Food Valley Classic 9th Omloop van het Houtland 2013 1st Kernen Omloop Echt-Susteren 1st Ronde van Noord-Holland 2nd Ronde van Vlaanderen Beloften 4th Dorpenomloop Rucphen 5th Overall Olympia's Tour 6th Nationale Sluitingsprijs 8th Zuid Oost Drenthe Classic I 9th Antwerpse Havenpijl 2014 1st Ronde van Vlaanderen Beloften 1st Stage 2 Tour de Normandie 3rd Trofeo Palma 3rd Zuid Oost Drenthe Classic I 10th Ronde van Overijssel 10th Gooikse Pijl 2015 (2 pro wins) 1st Arnhem–Veenendaal Classic 1st Brussels Cycling Classic 4th Road race, National Road Championships 5th Handzame Classic 7th Grote Prijs Stad Zottegem 2016 (11) 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st Rund um Köln 1st Heistse Pijl 1st Tour de l'Eurométropole 1st Arnhem–Veenendaal Classic Tour de Yorkshire 1st Points classification 1st Stage 1 Ster ZLM Toer 1st Points classification 1st Stage 3 Tour of Britain 1st Points classification 1st Stage 4 1st Stage 1 Eneco Tour 1st Stage 1 Driedaagse van West-Vlaanderen 1st Stage 3 Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 2nd Handzame Classic 3rd Ronde van Drenthe 3rd Nokere Koerse 4th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 6th EuroEyes Cyclassics 6th Le Samyn 9th Scheldeprijs 2017 (8) Ster ZLM Toer 1st Points classification 1st Stages 2 & 3 Tour of Norway 1st Stages 2 & 4 1st Stage 21 Tour de France 1st Stage 5 Tour of Guangxi 1st Stage 1 Tour de Yorkshire 1st Stage 7 Tour of Britain 2nd Overall Dubai Tour 1st Young rider classification 2nd Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 3rd EuroEyes Cyclassics 3rd Tacx Pro Classic 5th Dwars door Vlaanderen 5th Münsterland Giro 2018 (14) 1st Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen 1st Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 1st Arnhem–Veenendaal Classic Tour of Norway 1st Stages 1, 3 & 4 Tour de France 1st Stages 7 & 8 Volta ao Algarve 1st Stages 1 & 4 1st Stage 2 Paris–Nice 1st Stage 1 Tour of Guangxi 1st Stage 1 Dubai Tour 1st Stage 2 Tour of Slovenia 7th Gooikse Pijl 2019 (15) 1st Three Days of Bruges–De Panne 1st Tacx Pro Classic Four Days of Dunkirk 1st Stages 1, 2 & 3 Tour of Britain 1st Stages 1, 3 & 5 Tour de France 1st Stages 2 (TTT) & 7 Paris–Nice 1st Stages 1 & 2 1st Stage 4 Volta ao Algarve 1st Stage 5 Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 3rd Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen 4th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 4th Primus Classic 7th Overall ZLM Tour 1st Points classification 1st Stages 1 & 2 2020 (3) Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 1st Points classification 1st Stages 1 & 3 1st Stage 4 UAE Tour 2021 (3) Tour de Wallonie 1st Points classification 1st Stages 1 & 4 1st Stage 1 Danmark Rundt 2nd Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen 3rd Ronde van Drenthe 9th Binche–Chimay–Binche 10th Elfstedenronde 2022 (7) 1st Veenendaal–Veenendaal Classic Saudi Tour 1st Points classification 1st Stages 3 & 5 1st Stage 3 Tour de France 1st Stage 2 Tour of Slovenia 1st Stage 2 Arctic Race of Norway 1st Stage 4 Tour de Hongrie 2nd Classic Brugge–De Panne 2nd Grand Prix de Fourmies 2nd Paris–Chauny 3rd Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen 3rd Omloop van het Houtland 3rd Memorial Rik Van Steenbergen 4th Rund um Köln 5th Gooikse Pijl 7th Münsterland Giro 2023 (6) 1st Veenendaal–Veenendaal Classic Tour of Slovenia 1st Stages 1 & 2 Saudi Tour 1st Points classification 1st Stage 1 1st Stage 5 UAE Tour 1st Stage 1 Tour de Hongrie 2nd Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen 2nd Omloop van het Houtland 3rd Gooikse Pijl 4th Scheldeprijs 10th Milano–Torino 2024 (1) 1st Clàssica Comunitat Valenciana 1969 2nd Bredene Koksijde Classic 9th Gent–Wevelgem Stage 1 was an individual time trial.
