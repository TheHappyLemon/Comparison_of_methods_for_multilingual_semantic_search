The extended version, which was used in the music video, also features Timbaland's brother Sebastian and rapper D.O.E., who both contribute an extra verse after the bridge. The director noted that the influence of making the video came from the sound of the song and used the rhythm and beats to add effects to make the video have an edgy appeal.

See media help. "The Way I Are" is an electrohop and electro-funk song with a length of two minutes and fifty-nine seconds. It is written in the key of G♯ minor and is set in common time with a tempo of approximately 115 beats per minute. The song incorporates heavy elements of R&B, dance and electronic music and has been noted by critics to exhibit a futuristic sound. It is built upon a club beat and heavy synths. The lyrics are centered around the theme of sexual desire and role reversal; Timbaland explains that he is flat broke, while Hilson replies that she does not care about any of that, and jokes that she can pay him to strip. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times described the track as a "swirling electronic come-on" while Luke Bainbridge of The Observer labelled it as "futuristic disco". Critics found the song to share similarities with works by American singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake, who has worked with Timbaland on numerous occasions, from his second studio album FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006). Mike Schiller of PopMatters compared the synthesizers on the song to those utilized in Timberlake's single "My Love" (2006), which both him and Timbaland share songwriting and production credits. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine felt the same way, describing the synth line as "booming" and "futuristic". Norman Meyers of Prefix compared the song to Timberlake's "SexyBack". Nate Patrin of Pitchfork Magazine described the song as "'Push It' gone trance". Norman Meyers of Prefix took a liking to the song, stating it and "Release" (featuring Justin Timberlake) as "successful tracks". Luke Bainbridge of The Observer also shared interest in the track, labeling it along with "Release" and "Bounce" as "standout tracks", while Andy Kellman of AllMusic did the same with the song along with three other songs from the Shock Value album. Daniel Incognito of Sputnikmusic praised the song's structure, writing "The pulsating synth melody throughout the song is as irresistible as its My Love counterpart, and a sure fire way to get everybody on the dance floor." Incognito also fell in favor of the vocals provided by Timbaland's protégé, Keri Hilson, writing "Her plush R&B vocals fit into Timbaland's construction perfectly, never allowing the strong melody to dominate her vocals, but instead matching it in terms of lure." Nate Patrin of Pitchfork Magazine describes the song as a "straight up jaw-dropper." Nathan S. of DJBooth.net labeled it, along with three other songs from the album, as recipes for success while noting that they sounded "safe" compared to the rest of the album. Ivan Rott of About.com was less enthusiastic of the song, deeming it mediocre and stating that it was "veering off into a no-man's land of repetitive synth-heavy electronica". Andrea Park of The Online Gargoyle shared the same thoughts in her review of the album, stating that "The flat quality of this album was most apparent in the five songs with accompanying female vocalists." "The Way I Are" received a nomination at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards for "Monster Single of the Year" along with nine other musicians, but lost to Rihanna's "Umbrella". Timbaland also received a nomination at the 2008 Grammys for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical) for his work on this song and many others released during 2007. On December 11, 2007, Apple released the lists of iTunes' top 10 most-downloaded albums and songs of 2007 and "The Way I Are" was revealed to be the ninth best selling single on iTunes.

Drake commented on the video and said: I like to tell stories with my videos — and Timbaland's new video is going to be unlike any other. Utilizing the tools of incendiary cinematography and fierce lighting schemes, I plan to sculpt an edgy masterpiece, oozing with style and impact. With each rhythmic pulse and beat we will time crafty edits, sharp as tacks and smooth as steel. This video is going to be an artistic expression of Timbaland's music. As an added element of force and velocity, we will follow Timbaland as he cruises around the city. From the colors, to the wardrobe — to the edits, we will craft a slick masterpiece that defies genre and truly defines cool & will show off Timbaland in a "super" music video. The video version of the song includes an extra verse from Timbaland's brother Sebastian. This verse was added to 'pad out' the song, as the album version of the song has an elongated period of time in which nothing but the beat is played. Though being unusual for American music video productions, the video world premiered and received its first official airing on June 15 on the German music television channel VIVA. The video also includes three British freestyle football players. A "director's cut" of the video is now on YouTube and it features Timbaland in a black cab and shows him in a more casual perspective. The music video has received over 500 million views on YouTube.
