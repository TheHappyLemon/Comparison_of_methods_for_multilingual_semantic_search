On 20 November 2022, he set the record of most appearances in the national team. Dzsudzsák, who has Polish roots, was born in Debrecen but grew up in Nyírlugos. He started at Nyíradony Focisuli and was signed by Debreceni Olasz Focisuli, a football academy for young talents and was a sure way towards Debreceni VSC. In 2004, he played for Létavértes on loan from Debrecen in Nemzeti Bajnokság III, the Hungarian third division. Dzsudzsák made his debut in the Hungarian National Championship I in 2004. He played twice during his first season with Debrecen. In his second season, he played ten matches and scored two goals. In the following two seasons, he became a permanent member of the squad, playing 36 matches and scoring 12 goals. He won the Hungarian National Championship I three times, in 2005, 2006 and 2007 and the Hungarian Super Cup three times, in 2005, 2006 and 2007. On 24 October 2007, Dzsudzsák joined Dutch side PSV, signing a five-year contract. The left winger was originally to make his transfer to PSV in the summer of 2008, although the departure of Kenneth Perez from the PSV squad prompted PSV to speed up his transfer to January 2008. PSV scout Piet de Visser stated that Dzsudzsák "is an incredible talent. He is fast, good in the combination, can pass his man and give a good cross. You don't see them like this very often anymore. He is a modern left-winger". Dzsudzsák made his Eredivisie debut on 12 January 2008, a 1–0 win against Feyenoord; Dzsudzsák was in the starting XI in the match and recorded three shots on goal. On the next matchday, he scored his first league goal in a 1–1 draw with VVV-Venlo. Dzsudzsák recorded his first assist on 23 January 2008 in a 3–1 win against Sparta Rotterdam.

Dzsudzsák finished the 2009–10 season with 14 goals and 16 assists. In a UEFA Europa League match against Hamburger SV, Dzsudzsák was shown a straight red card by English referee Mike Dean after the player pushed the match official. In 2010–11, Dzsudzsák had his best season yet for PSV and his career, as he scored 16 goals and provided 12 assists, finishing fourth and fifth in the Eredivisie respectively; he also scored 7 goals in 13 matches in European competitions for a total of 24 goals in 49 games. In 2011, Dzsudzsák signed an extension to his contract with PSV. Although he extended his contract at PSV, there was still interest from other clubs, including Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala. On 12 June 2011, Dzsudzsák was transferred to Russian Premier League club Anzhi Makhachkala for an undisclosed fee, signing a four-year contract. "I am very happy to become part of an ambitious project at Anzhi," he said. "It is a big step forward in my career. I am eagerly looking forward to getting on the pitch with my new team-mates Roberto Carlos, Samuel Eto'o, Mbark Boussoufa, Diego Tardelli and others. I have heard a lot about the fantastic atmosphere at home games in Makhachkala." He made his Anzhi debut on 6 August against Tom Tomsk in a 2–0 victory. Dzsudzsák made eight appearances for Anzhi, mostly as a substitute.
