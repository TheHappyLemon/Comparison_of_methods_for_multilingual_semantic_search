56°57′18″N 24°09′32″E﻿ / ﻿56.9549973°N 24.158839°E﻿ / 56.9549973; 24.158839 Daugava National Stadium (Latvian: Daugavas stadions) is a multifunctional stadium in Riga, Latvia, which was first opened in 1927. It holds football and athletics competitions. Since 1992 the Daugava Stadium has been designated as a sports facility of national importance. It is owned by the Government of Latvia. The first stadium on the location was built in 1927 and was first operated by the Strādnieku sports un sargs (Worker Sports and Guard, SSS) sports organization affiliated with the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party. After the stadium had been abandoned after the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, the stadium was re-established in 1945, with renovation works beginning in 1949. Before July 1990 the total capacity of the stadium was more than 10,000 people, but after the demolition of the north, east and south stands in 1999 it was reduced to 5,683. The Latvia national football team were playing its home games at the Daugava stadium from 1991 until 2000, when Skonto Stadium was unveiled as a temporary venue while the planned renovation of Daugava Stadium was underway, with the team returning to Daugava in the summer of 2018. However, in the fall of 2022, the Latvian Football Federation moved the national team back to Skonto Stadium. The second tenant since June 2018 – FS Metta/LU – moved back to Riga Hanza Secondary School Stadium at the same time. A possible reason were complaints from local football clubs and athletes that rent of the stadium was too expensive. Previous tenants have included FC Daugava, FK Daugava 90, JFK Olimps and others. Two exercise venues under the main stand, tennis and athletics grounds and artificial turf pitches are also a part of the complex. The Latvian Football Federation headquarters were located within the complex from 1991 until 2009, when the offices were moved to the Elektrum Olympic Center. The Daugava Stadium has traditionally hosted the dance performances of the Latvian Song and Dance Festival. To celebrate the 90th anniversary of the independence of Latvia, on October 19, 2008, a new Guinness World Record was set at the venue for the most people running 100 metres in a 24-hour relay. There were 3,807 participants. On September 27, 2022, four state-owned sports institutions – stadium manager VSIA Kultūras un sporta centrs “Daugavas stadions” (Daugava Stadium Culture and Sports Centre), Sigulda Bobsleigh and Luge Track, Lielupe Tennis Centre (Tenisa centrs "Lielupe") in Jūrmala and Mežaparks Sports Center (Sporta centrs "Mežaparks") – were reorganized and merged, creating the Latvian National Sports Centre (SIA Latvijas Nacionālais sporta centrs, LNSC). The project for the renovation of the stadium received funds from the European Regional Development Fund and the Latvian government in 2015 and the works officially started in September 2017, after a €62 million contract was signed on June 5 for the reconstruction of the stadium and the creation of the Grīziņkalns sports and culture district in its surroundings. On 15 May 2018, the first phase of the renovation was completed, in the course of which new stands were built on both goal ends, increasing the capacity of the stadium from 5,683 seats to 10,461 seats, the main western stand with its indoor athletics facilities, conference rooms and VIP facilities were fully renovated and a new electronic scoreboard display was installed. After the renovation the stadium now meets UEFA Category 4 and IAAF Category 2 requirements. The second and final phase – during which the construction of a roof over the west terrace, a new ice rink replacing the one built in 1960 (demolished in 2018) and new, multi-functional sports halls is planned – is scheduled to be completed by 2022. In April 2020 the construction of the new ice arena was started after the final construction permit was issued by the Riga City Council. The deadline for the unveiling of the venue is set for March 2021 in time for the 2021 IIHF World Championship. The final works were completed in early May. Large-scale renovation projects were launched in 2022–2023. The new, €12.3 million athletics hall is due to be commissioned on December 31, although Latvijas Radio reported that interior works are behind schedule as of late September. The upcoming hall would host track and field athletes autumn to spring, and sports teams during the summer, e.g. volleyball, indoor football, handball and floorball, along with a possibility to host cultural events in the hall. A bobsleigh start ramp is under construction as well. In the stadium, the replacement of the football field turf and worn-out athletics track, as well as the installation of heating systems, is set to begin in late 2023. Once complete, the complex is expected to include a football and athletics stadium, an ice hall, an athletic and sports game hall, an inflatable football practice hall, an athletic practice field and a basketball and other sports game hall on Krišjānis Barons Street in Riga.
