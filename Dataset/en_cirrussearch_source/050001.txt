Solanke signed his first professional contract with Chelsea in September 2014. Due to the injury of Diego Costa, Solanke was named on the bench for a Premier League match against Crystal Palace on 18 October 2014. Three days later, he made his first-team debut as a substitute for Oscar in the 73rd minute of a 6–0 win over NK Maribor in the UEFA Champions League.

On 10 April 2015, Solanke scored two goals in the semi-final of the 2014–15 UEFA Youth League against Roma to send Chelsea into the final.

A week later, Solanke scored his first goal in a 4–1 victory over SC Cambuur after coming off the bench with 15 minutes to go. He ended the season with seven goals in 25 appearances, just three behind top scorer Valeri Qazaishvili and one behind runner-up Milot Rashica.

On 30 May 2017, Solanke agreed to sign for Premier League club Liverpool on 1 July upon the expiration of his Chelsea contract.

His first Premier League start for Liverpool came on 30 November in a 3–0 win over Stoke City at the Bet365 Stadium. He scored his first and only Liverpool goal on 13 May 2018, the final day of the 2017–18 season, in the 4–0 home victory against Brighton & Hove Albion. Solanke signed for fellow Premier League club AFC Bournemouth on 4 January 2019 on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee, reported by BBC Sport as £19 million. He made his debut on 2 February in a 2–0 away loss against Cardiff City in the league. Solanke scored his first and second Premier League goals for Bournemouth in his 39th league appearance on 12 July 2020, a 4–1 win over Leicester City. He then scored in Bournemouth's 3–1 victory at Everton on the final day of the 2019–20 Premier League season but it was not enough to save the club from relegation to the EFL Championship. Solanke scored fifteen goals during the 2020–21 season, finishing as the club’s joint top goal scorer in the Championship along with Arnaut Danjuma. The following season, Solanke scored 29 goals as Bournemouth were promoted back to the Premier League, finishing as runner-up in the Championship.

Solanke thus became the first Bournemouth player to win the award. Solanke has represented England at all youth levels. In May 2014, Solanke was part of the under-17 team that won the 2014 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. He was the tournament's joint top scorer with four goals in four appearances, a brace against Turkey, a goal in the semi-final secured a place in the final, and England's goal in the final.

On 27 May 2019, Solanke was included in England's 23-man squad for the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Solanke primarily plays as a striker, although can also operate as either an attacking midfielder or a winger.[citation needed] Former Chelsea striker Tore André Flo has said that Solanke "works really hard", has "got very good physique" and "a great touch on the ball". He went on to say: "He's quick but often what impresses me the most is when he looks like he's lost the ball, he somehow manages to get out with the ball, no matter how tight the situation is or how difficult it looks".
