Pasažieru vilciens (lit. 'Passenger train', abbreviated: PV; trade name Vivi) is the only passenger-carrying railway company in Latvia, operating both electric and diesel trains on various lines throughout the country. It was formed in November 2001 by bringing together two separate companies, PPU Elektrovilciens ('Electric Train') and PPU Dīzeļvilciens ('Diesel Train') under one name, creating the first subsidiary of Latvian Railways (Latvijas dzelzceļš). As of October 2008 JSC "Pasažieru vilciens" is an independent state-owned company. As of 2017, the company employed 1,075 people. Vivi currently operates ten routes (four electric, six diesel) with its main operating base being the capital city, Riga; and carried 18.6 million passengers in 2019. In November 29, 2023, Pasažieru vilciens launched a rebrand to Vivi (from the Latvian phrase vienā vilcienā - 'on one train') and a signal yellow-grey colour scheme. The gradual rebrand is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2024. The original name will be kept as the legal name of the company. JSC "Pasažieru vilciens" operates the passenger transports in the following electric train routes: Rīga – Carnikava – Saulkrasti – Skulte Rīga – Dubulti – Sloka – Ķemeri – Tukums 1 – Tukums 2 Rīga – Jelgava Rīga – Ogre – Lielvārde – Aizkraukle and in the following diesel train routes: Rīga – Jelgava – Dobele – Liepāja Rīga – Krustpils – Līvāni – Daugavpils – Krāslava – Indra Rīga – Krustpils – Rēzekne – Zilupe Rīga – Pļaviņas – Madona – Gulbene Rīga – Sigulda – Cēsis – Valmiera – Valga the following routes have ended service in recent years Rīga – Ērgļi (2007) Rīga – Reņģe (2010) Rīga – Ventspils (2010) A 50 cent fee must be paid if a train ticket is purchased from the conductor while on the train, provided that the station from which the ticket is being bought is open at the time. The main stations on the Vivi network are: Aizkraukle Carnikava Cēsis Daugavpils Dobele Dubulti Jelgava Krustpils Ķemeri Lielvārde Liepāja Līvāni Madona Ogre Pļaviņas Rēzekne Rīga Saulkrasti Sigulda Skulte Sloka Torņakalns Tukums Valga (Estonia) Valmiera Vecāķi Zemitāni Zilupe The current rolling stock consists of mainly elderly Soviet-period trains built locally by Rīgas Vagonbūves Rūpnīca (RVR), although some have been refurbished in recent years, and Škoda 16Ev. In 2016 PV received 19 modernized DR1A DMU train wagons from DMU vilcieni in cooperation with RVR, Daugavpils Lokomotīvju Remonta Rūpnīca and Zasulauks depot. However, LSM reported in October 2016 that the refurbished wagons soon experienced quality issues. The livery of electric trains and some diesel trains is yellow and blue, while some refurbished DMUs are in red and white. Since 2023, some trains have been painted in gray and yellow. From November 29, 2023, the company began to take into operation Skoda 16Ev electric trains manufactured in the Czech Republic. The first project for the procurement of new trains was announced in 2010 and 2011. In 2012 PV ordered 34 three-car electric multiple unit trains and seven three-car diesel multiple unit trains from CAF to be built on the Civity platform, with plans to manufacture them in cooperation with RVR. Later that year the contract was halted due to irregularities and an appeal from Stadler with the European Commission, an initial financial supporter of the project, and a new procurement organized. A hire/purchase contract for 25 Stadler FLIRT EMUs was likewise cancelled in July 2014 after an appeal from the other participant, Hyundai Rotem, and another tender organized. In December 2015, four contenders – Talgo, CAF, Stadler Polska and Škoda Vagonka – continued participation in the second stage of the train procurement project. The contract includes the delivery of 32 electric trains with a capacity of 450 each, from 2020 to 2023, maintenance equipment, spare parts for five years and staff training. Talgo's VitTal was announced as the provisional winner of the €225.3 million contract in November 2018 although Škoda rejected the methodology used to assess price competitiveness. Škoda and CAF filed a successful appeal of the results of the procurement in December, while Stadler expressed disappointment at the results. After reviewing the results of the contest under instructions from the government's procurement watchdog agency, the Procurement Monitoring Bureau (PMB), PV announced on February 15, 2019 that the offer from Škoda worth €241.88 million has been selected as the new winner, based on revised electricity consumption cost estimates. Talgo announced in a press release the same day that they will contest the decision. On May 21, 2019, PV announced that after the second revision of the submitted bids, Škoda was again confirmed as the winner, however, the decision could yet again be contested. The offer of Talgo was mentioned as to have had a lower price per unit, but the maintenance costs of Škoda trains were found to be lower with the total cost lower as well. Minister of Transport Tālis Linkaits commented on this that due to potential issues regarding the implication of Škoda Transportation A.S., a subsidiary of Škoda Transportation Group and a sister company of Škoda Vagonka, in recent corruption scandals concerning the Rīgas Satiksme public transport company, a failure to wrap up the procurement by the end of the year might lead to the dissolution of PV. The PMB turned down the final complaint by Talgo on July 4, giving PV the go-ahead to sign a contract with Škoda Vagonka. In a statement, the PV predicted that they would receive the first trains in late 2021, with the last ones being shipped in late 2023. The contract between PV and Škoda Vagonka a.s. was finally signed on 30 July 2019. Under the agreement, all 32 EMU trains have to be delivered by 2023 or 140 weeks after the contract takes effect. Each 109-meter-long four-car train with a top speed of 160 km/h will accommodate 436 seated and 450 standing passengers. The trains are expected to operate services from Riga to Aizkraukle, Tukums, Jelgava and Skulte, as well as the inter-urban routes from and to Krustpils, Daugavpils and Rēzekne which are expected to be modernized and electrified at 25 kV 50 Hz for completion by the end of 2023. In February 2020, a new signal yellow, anthracite gray and dark gray livery design created by Teika Design Studio for the future trains was unveiled by PV. Due to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the end date of full delivery was postponed till at least end of 2023, since originally it was planned to deliver all trains to Latvia on tracks through Ukraine and Belarus, due to the same track gauge. The first four-car train was delivered in June 2022 in parts by road through Poland and Lithuania and will be used for testing purposes in the coming months. Each train will be designed for 436 passengers. While initially it was said that the new trains would enter service in January 2023, cited problems like production delays caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, and a long certification process still in progress, have repeatedly pushed this back to 'no earlier' than November. Currently, 14 electric trains have been assembled in Latvia, with nine more left to go until the end of the year. The final deliveries are now planned for the first half of 2024. The first regular journey of the new model took place on December 15, 2023, on the route Riga – Dubulti. Trains heading for Aizkraukle, Tukums and Skulte would follow, concluding with the Jelgava route on December 16. In January 2024, five newly delivered Škoda 16Ev electric trains stopped running after several technical problems. On January 2, the train on the Saulkrasti–Rīga route stopped at Garciems station after the train's pantograph went down and the cabin heating stopped working. After several other repeated incidents with the new trains, Transport Minister Kaspars Briškens and Vivi demanded explanations from Škoda Vagonka about the defects and on January 5 informed passengers about the possibility to request compensation in case of canceled trains. On January 25, 2024, the members of the company's board announced their resignations, as they claimed that solving the crisis caused by the Škoda Vagonka electric trains is beyond the board's functions and scope. Later, the Ministry of Transport informed that a temporary council had been appointed in its place. On the other hand, on January 26, the Minister of Transport announced that it is being considered to return the sets of the new trains back to the manufacturer as defects and to ask the government for money for the overhaul of the old trains. In May 2020, PV announced that it would procure 8 new diesel trains to replace existing DMUs with Russian-made engines due to the addition of the manufacturers to the United States sanctions list. Five bidders applied, with three advancing to the second round in July - CAF, Pesa Bydgoszcz and Stadler Polska. PV said it planned to sign a contract by December 31. However, this did not materialise, in part due to uncertainties concerning available funding and with the Ministry of Transport switching its focus on acquiring battery-powered trains (BEMU) by 2026, citing such upsides as a lesser impact on the environment and less noise. The ministry announced plans to order feasibility study for evaluating the technological and economic aspects of the intended purchase in the second half of 2021. The ministry added that the BEMUs would be mainly used in Riga and the Riga region. A tender for 9 BEMU trains (with an option to purchase seven additional ones if funding is available) was announced on 13 April 2022 by the Road Transport Administration, which predicted that new units for a new Bolderāja – Riga – Sigulda line would be delivered by the end of 2026. Each train would have a capacity of 200–240 seats and the overall cost was predicted at €75-76 million. The submission deadline for the first round was June, with the second round scheduled for autumn of 2022. Three bids were submitted by CAF, Škoda Transportation/Škoda Vagonka and Stadler Polska, with all advancing to the next round. However, in May 2023 it was reported by Delfi that the second round is delayed due to long documentation works. In September, the outgoing Minister of Transport Jānis Vitenbergs told LTV1 Panorāma news that 'everything has been prepared for the start of a tender and it just needs to be announced'. The Latvian Autotransport Directorate then announced it planned to start the tender 'in the near time'. Personāla statistika (in Latvian) "About us". Pasažieru Vilciens. Retrieved 2018-10-22.
