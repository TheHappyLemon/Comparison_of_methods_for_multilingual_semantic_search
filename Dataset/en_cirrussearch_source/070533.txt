The 2024 World Figure Skating Championships were held in Montreal, Canada, from March 18â€“24, 2024. Montreal was originally scheduled to host the 2020 World Championships, but they were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The competition determined the entry quotas for each federation at the 2025 World Championships. Skaters were eligible for the 2024 World Championships if they turned 16 years of age before July 1, 2023, and if they met the minimum technical elements score requirements. The ISU accepted technical minimum scores if they were obtained at senior-level ISU-recognized international competitions during the ongoing season at least 21 days before the first official practice day of the championships or during the preceding season. SP/RD and FS/FD scores may be attained at different events. Based on the results of the 2023 World Championships, each ISU member nation could field one to three entries per discipline. Russia and Belarus were banned from participating "until further notice" due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. If not listed above, one entry is allowed. Member nations began announcing their selections in December 2023. The International Skating Union published a complete list of entries on February 27, 2024.
