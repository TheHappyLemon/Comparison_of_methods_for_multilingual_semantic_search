A double-dagger (‡) denotes an indoor stadium with a fixed or retractable roof with interior climate control. On September 2, 2020, CONCACAF announced that 2022 FIFA World Cup hosts Qatar would participate in the 2021 and 2023 tournaments. The remaining teams qualified through the 2022–23 CONCACAF Nations League and the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup qualification: The top eight teams in the Nations League A qualified for the Gold Cup, and the remaining four teams entered the qualifying tournament. The top four teams in the Nations League B qualified for the Gold Cup, and the next best four teams entered the qualifying tournament. The top four teams in the Nations League C entered the qualifying tournament. The top three teams in the qualifying tournament qualified for the Gold Cup. Before submitting their final squad for the tournament, teams named a provisional squad of up to 60 players. Teams were required to have their 60-player roster submitted to CONCACAF by May 25. Teams were required to name their final squads by June 14. The final draw was held on April 14, 2023, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, completed alongside the draw for the preliminary round. The teams were split into four pots based on the CONCACAF Rankings of March 2023. The four teams of Pot 1 were automatically seeded, with the United States in Group A as the title holders, Mexico in Group B, Costa Rica in Group C, and Canada in Group D. Guests Qatar were placed in Pot 4 alongside the three winners of the preliminary round, whose identities were not known at the time of the draw, indicated by PM (Preliminary Match) and their corresponding Preliminary Match number. In the draw, teams were first selected from their pots, in order from Pot 1 to 4. Then, a ball was drawn from a separate group of pots (Pot 5 to 8) to determine final groupings. Nicaragua originally qualified as winners of CONCACAF Nations League B Group C, but were disqualified for fielding an ineligible player. They were replaced by Trinidad and Tobago, the runners-up in Group C who had originally qualified for the preliminary round. On June 7, 2023, CONCACAF announced a total of 13 referees, 6 support referees, 26 assistant referees and 15 video assistant referees (VAR) appointed for the tournament.
