Bosnia and Herzegovina has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 19 times since making its debut in 1993, after coming second in the qualification round "Kvalifikacija za Millstreet". Prior to 1993, Bosnia and Herzegovina participated in the Eurovision Song Contest as part of Yugoslavia. Bosnia and Herzegovina's best result was in 2006, when Hari Mata Hari finished third with the song "Lejla". This remains the country's only top five result in the contest. The country also achieved five other top ten results: 1999 with Dino Merlin (seventh), 2004 with Deen (ninth), 2008 with Laka (tenth), 2009 with Regina (ninth), and 2011, again with Dino Merlin (sixth). Bosnia and Herzegovina returned to the contest for the first time since 2012 at the 2016 contest, where it failed to advance from the semi-finals for the first time. The country then withdrew once again from the contest and has yet to return. Low average scores meant Bosnia and Herzegovina did not qualify for the contests in 1998 and 2000, and the country did not participate in the 2013 contest for financial reasons. BHRT had stated that it hoped to return to the contest in 2014, and on 18 November 2013, it submitted a preliminary application to compete in the 2014 contest. However, on 18 December 2013, it was announced that Bosnia and Herzegovina would not be returning for 2014. On 9 September 2014, BHRT announced that it had submitted an application to compete in the 2015 contest. On 30 October 2014, BHRT stated that participation was still in jeopardy due to financial difficulties. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) granted it a deadline extension until 14 November 2014 to make a final decision regarding its participation. On 17 November 2014, BHRT announced that it would not be competing in the 2015 contest, having not secured the necessary funds to finance its participation. On 29 September 2016, BHRT again announced its withdrawal from the competition in 2017, due to the difficult financial situation that the national broadcaster was currently facing. The following December, BHRT was sanctioned by the EBU due to unpaid debts, by restricting the broadcaster access to common resources. The Bosnian head of delegation, Lejla Babović, confirmed on 29 December 2018 that BHRT's current primary goal was to return to Eurovision, but its current financial situation and mounting debts with the EBU made a return in the near future highly unlikely. This was confirmed for the following years, with a statement in November 2023 that the broadcaster remains under sanctions and is unable to compete in EBU events. Prior to Yugoslavia's dissolution, artists from the Bosnian federal unit represented Yugoslavia in 1964, 1965, 1973, 1976, and 1981. From 1961 until 1991, Bosnia and Herzegovina competed as part of Yugoslavia.

For example, if Germany and France placed inside the top ten, the 11th and 12th spots were advanced to next year's grand final along with all countries ranked in the top ten. All conductors are of Bosnian nationality unless otherwise noted. The spokesperson from the prequalifying round was Ismeta Dervoz-Krvavac Jiandani, Sanjay (14 December 2012).
