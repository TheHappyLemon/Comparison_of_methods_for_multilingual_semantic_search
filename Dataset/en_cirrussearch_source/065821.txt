Haleji Lake (Urdu: ہالیجی جھیل) is a perennial freshwater lake in Thatta District of Sindh Province, Pakistan. It is 6.58 km2 (2.54 sq mi) in size and is surrounded by marshes and brackish seepage lagoons. Haleji Lake was a saline lagoon until the 1930s and was converted into a reservoir to provide additional water to Karachi. During World War II, additional water was required for troops stationed at Karachi. The then-British Government of Sindh Province decided to increase the capacity of the lake by introducing a feeder canal from the Indus River. Salt water was drained out and an embankment was constructed around the lake which was fed with fresh water through a canal. The work was placed on a war footing and was completed within 24 months in 1943. Haleji Lake is a wintering site for waterfowl such as cotton teal, Indian spot-billed duck, purple moorhen and pheasant-tailed jacana. It is also a breeding site for egrets and herons.
