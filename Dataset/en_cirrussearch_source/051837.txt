Jakub Jankto (pronounced [ˈjakup ˈjaŋkto]; born 19 January 1996) is a Czech professional footballer who plays for Serie A club Cagliari, and the Czech Republic national team. A versatile player, Jankto can play as a full-back, left midfielder or left winger. Jankto signed for Udinese from Slavia Prague in 2014 for a reported fee of €700,000. Without making his league debut for the team, he went on loan to Serie B side Ascoli in 2015, debuting on 15 September in a Serie B 1–0 home win against Virtus Entella.[citation needed] On 6 July 2018, Sampdoria announced that Jankto had joined the club on an initial loan deal with an obligation to make the transfer permanent for €15 million. On 12 August 2018, Jankto scored on his debut for Sampdoria in a 1–0 Coppa Italia win against Viterbese. Sampdoria later made the transfer permanent. On 20 August 2021, Jankto signed a two-year contract with La Liga club Getafe CF. On 10 August of the following year, he returned to his home country after joining Sparta Prague on a one-year loan deal. On 15 July 2023, Jankto signed a two-year contract with option with Serie A club Cagliari. In March 2017, Jankto received his first call-up by coach Karel Jarolím to the Czech senior squad for two matches against Lithuania (friendly) and San Marino (2018 FIFA World Cup qualification). The same year on 22 March, he debuted in the former match in a 2-0 victory. Jankto was in a relationship with model Markéta Ottomanská and they had a son. They separated in 2021. On 13 February 2023, Jankto publicly came out as gay in a social media statement, becoming the first active senior international men's footballer to do so. Jankto's move received support from football clubs, footballers and other athletes. On 18 April 2023, Jankto was stopped by police near the Sparta Prague Strahov training center. He submitted to a breath test behind the wheel of his vehicle, but refused to take a drug test and a medical examination. He also drove without a driver's licence, which had been taken away by the authorities earlier in 2023. In response, club management initiated a meeting with Jankto, and it was decided that he will not participate in training sessions with the First Team.
