This is a list of the men's national association football teams in the world. The International Association Football Federation (FIFA) is the world's most important governing body for association football. A majority of national association football teams in the world are members of FIFA or one of its affiliated continental confederations. A majority of them also represent sovereign states with wide international recognition, with 188 of 195 United Nations (UN) member and observer states holding membership of FIFA. A notable exception is the United Kingdom, which is not a member of FIFA in its own right but is represented in the governing body by the teams of its four constituent countries. Other UN members and one observer state have either held membership in a confederation in the past and subsequently lost it, or have never belonged to either FIFA or one of its recognised confederations. Membership of FIFA and its confederations also includes national teams representing a few states with limited international recognition, one associated state with no UN membership, a significant number of dependent territories, and a limited number of autonomous areas. A majority of states with limited recognition, however, have no membership of FIFA or any of its confederations. This list divides national teams into three main groups: Teams that are either members of FIFA (211 teams), or have membership in a FIFA-affiliated continental confederation without being members of FIFA itself (11 teams). Teams that are not members of FIFA or any continental federation, but which represent UN member and observer states. This group includes four United Nations member states and one observer state (5 teams). Teams representing states with limited international recognition and no membership of FIFA or a confederation (6 teams), plus one representing an associated state with no membership of FIFA or a confederation. This list excludes other teams described by their supporters as 'national', which represent specific ethnic groups, cultural/historical regions, separatist or autonomist movements, speakers of specific languages, and micronations. These teams have historically participated in matches and tournaments outside FIFA's recognition, though some of them have sporadically or regularly played in friendly matches and tournaments against FIFA members. Some national teams with FIFA membership have disappeared due to belonging to a sovereign state or dependent territory which split into two or more states or territories (examples include the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, or the Netherlands Antilles), or by part of the territory becoming independent (such as the Ireland national football team, which ceased to exist as such after reaching a compromise with FIFA and recognising the Republic of Ireland national football team as representative of the independent part of Ireland). Other teams have disappeared by virtue of the states or territories they represented forming a new state by joining another entity or entities (examples include the teams representing Tanganyika and Malaya, which merged with other former colonies to respectively form the Tanzania and Malaysia football teams), or becoming part of an already existing state (as is the case with East Germany, which joined West Germany to form the unified Germany football team). In several cases the football records of dissolved teams are considered by FIFA as belonging to a successor entity (the Russia national team, for example, carries over the records of the Soviet Union national team). Defunct teams are listed on this page for historical purposes. Even if only members of FIFA and its affiliated confederations are taken into account, there are more national association football teams in the world than those of any other sport. This section lists the current: 211 men's national football teams affiliated to FIFA, through their national football associations. 11 men's national football teams who have membership in one of FIFA's affiliated continental confederations, but are not members of FIFA. FIFA members are eligible to enter the FIFA World Cup and matches between them are recognised as official international matches. Based on their match results over the previous four-year period, the FIFA Men's World Rankings, published monthly by FIFA, compare the relative strengths of the national teams. Some national teams that are members of a confederation but not FIFA members compete in confederation-level and subregional tournaments. These teams, however, are not allowed to participate in the World Cup. The six confederations are: Asia – Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Africa – Confederation of African Football (CAF) North and Central America and the Caribbean – Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) South America – South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) Oceania – Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) Europe – Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) FIFA runs the World Cup as a tournament for national teams to find the world champion. Each confederation also runs its own championship to find the best team from among its members: AFC – AFC Asian Cup CAF – Africa Cup of Nations CONCACAF – CONCACAF Gold Cup CONMEBOL – Copa América OFC – OFC Nations Cup UEFA – UEFA European Football Championship The Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA) organises competitions between Arab League member nations. All 22 national governing bodies that form UAFA are also members of both FIFA and either the AFC or CAF. National teams from UAFA member countries are noted in the list below. The Arab Cup is the top championship tournament for national teams, organised historically by UAFA and by FIFA in 2021. The Confederation of Independent Football Associations (ConIFA) is an organisation for teams representing unrecognised states, subnational regions, and stateless minorities, as well as teams from recognised states that have not managed to gain entry into FIFA. ConIFA is a successor to the Nouvelle Fédération-Board (N.F.-Board), which also organised tournaments for non-FIFA member teams. While none of the current ConIFA members are also members of FIFA, a few hold associate membership in one of the confederations affiliated with it. These teams are also noted in the list below. The ConIFA World Football Cup is the top tournament for ConIFA member nations. Due to the geographical size of Asia, the AFC is subdivided into five sub-federations: West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) – represents countries at the western extremity of the continent, except Israel. East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) – represents nations in East Asia, plus Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Central Asian Football Association (CAFA) – represents countries in Central Asia, comprising Afghanistan, Iran, Russia and most of Soviet Central Asia, except Kazakhstan. South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) – represents countries in South Asia. ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) – represents countries in Southeast Asia, plus Australia.

Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (COSAFA) – represents nations generally regarded as forming Southern Africa, as well as island states off the coast of Southern Africa. West African Football Union/Union du Football de l'Ouest Afrique (WAFU/UFOA) – represents nations in West Africa. Union of North African Federations (UNAF) – represents nations regarded as forming North Africa. Union des Fédérations du Football de l'Afrique Centrale (UNIFFAC) – represents some of the nations that form Central Africa. National governing body is a member of UAFA Official name used by FIFA for Democratic Republic of the Congo; official name used by CAF is DR Congo National governing body is an associate member of CAF but not a FIFA member National governing body was a full member of CAF briefly during 2017 The CONCACAF federation is divided into three regional federations that have responsibility for part of the region's geographical area: Caribbean Football Union (CFU) – represents all 27 nations in the Caribbean, plus Bermuda and three nations in South America. North American Football Union (NAFU) – represents the three countries in North America (not including Central America). Union Centroamericana de Fútbol (UNCAF) – represents the seven countries in Central America. National governing body is a full member of CONCACAF but not a FIFA member National governing body is an associate member of the OFC but not a FIFA member National governing body was formerly a member of AFC (1964–1966) Official name used by FIFA and the OFC for French Polynesia National governing body was formerly a member of AFC (1954–1974); joined UEFA in 1994 National governing body was formerly a member of AFC (1993–2002) Team currently suspended from participation in FIFA and UEFA competitions in response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine The national football teams included in this section are not members of FIFA, or of any of its affiliated continental confederations. The teams are not eligible to enter the FIFA World Cup or any continental confederation championships. FIFA's statutes do not allow member teams to compete against these sides without FIFA's prior permission. Several national associations for teams included in this section are members of ConIFA; these are indicated in the lists below. This section lists: 5 teams representing sovereign states which are member states of the United Nations or non-member observer states with the United Nations General Assembly. 8 teams representing states which are not members of the United Nations. Three UN members and one UN General Assembly observer state do not have any sort of membership in FIFA or any continental federation, but have fielded national association-organised teams in unofficial friendly matches or in tournaments held outside the auspices of FIFA. Another UN member state, while being officially represented in FIFA and UEFA by the teams of its constituent nations, has also fielded a team representing the entire state in exhibition matches. The national teams of these five states are listed below.  Federated States of Micronesia  Monaco1  Palau2  United Kingdom3  Vatican City National governing body was previously a member of the N.F.-Board and ConIFA. National governing body has been an associate member of the OFC in the past, but does not currently appear to be part of the confederation. The United Kingdom (UK) is not a member of FIFA or UEFA in its own right, being represented instead by the teams of its four constituent nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales). However, an exhibition UK team has played a small number of friendly matches. The UK has also been represented in the Summer Olympic and Summer Universiade football competitions by its own national teams. Two UN member states (the Marshall Islands and Nauru), have never fielded a national association-organised football team. Three states with limited international recognition and no UN membership are members of both FIFA and an affiliated confederation: the Republic of China (as Chinese Taipei), Kosovo, and Palestine. The Cook Islands is an associated state with no UN membership, but it is a member of both FIFA and the OFC. The national teams representing these states are all listed above. A further seven associated, de facto, or partially recognised states with no UN membership have fielded football teams in non-FIFA football tournaments or FIFA-unsanctioned friendly matches. None of these states, however, are currently members of FIFA or any of its affiliated continental confederations. The teams representing these states are listed below. Abkhazia1  Niue2  Northern Cyprus1,3  Somaliland1  South Ossetia1  Transnistria4 Western Sahara1,3 National governing body is currently a member of ConIFA. National governing body was previously an associate member of the OFC (membership revoked in March 2021). National governing body was previously a member of the N.F.-Board. National governing body is a former member of ConIFA. Historically, the majority of FIFA and confederation members have been sovereign states with wide diplomatic recognition. Exceptions to this rule have included the British Home Nations (due to their seminal role in the development of football), Palestine (accepted into FIFA after the creation of the Palestinian National Authority), the Republic of China (which does not enjoy wide recognition but is still accepted as representative of the Taiwan area), and certain dependent territories, autonomous areas, and protectorates which, on the grounds of their political autonomy, separate status, and/or distance from their parent state, have been allowed to hold membership in FIFA and/or one of its affiliated confederations. At present, FIFA members include 23 subnational and dependent territories, as well as three states with limited international recognition. A further nine overseas, dependent, and autonomous territories with close ties to a sovereign state do not have membership in FIFA, but are members of one of its affiliated confederations (either in a full or associate capacity). In 2016, FIFA made changes to its statutes to define 'country' as "an independent state recognized by the international community". In 2011, UEFA had already changed its statutes so that only countries recognised as independent states by the United Nations could join the organisation., while CAF rescinded Zanzibar's full membership (which had been approved only months before) in 2017 on the grounds that Zanzibar is not a country as defined by the African Union and the United Nations. With some exceptions (such as the acceptances of Gibraltar and Kosovo into FIFA and UEFA in 2016), these regulations have made it harder for aspiring national associations to join FIFA or its affiliated confederations. Examples include Jersey (UEFA application rejected in 2018),Bonaire (FIFA application rejected in 2019), Sint Maarten (FIFA application rejected in 2022 or before), and Greenland (applied to CONCACAF in 2022 due to lack of prospects of being accepted into UEFA). International football matches have historically taken place without approval or sanctioning from FIFA or its associated confederations. Some national teams who are currently members of FIFA or a regional confederation played in matches or even official tournaments against FIFA members before being accepted into FIFA (examples include the Croatia, Kosovo, Palestine, Slovakia, and Slovenia football teams, among others). Some now-defunct national teams even participated in major international competitions against FIFA member nations without having ever been admitted into FIFA or one of its confederations (the most notorious example is the North Vietnam national football team, which participated in the Games of the New Emerging Forces football competitions). There have also been unsanctioned national teams set up to further the aims of national independence movements, such as the FLN football team. In addition to the above, since the early 20th Century there have been teams representing dependent territories or cultural regions which have played or continue to play in matches and tournaments against club sides and FIFA-affiliated national teams without any sanctioning from FIFA or regional confederations (examples include the Jersey, Gibraltar, Catalonia, Brittany, Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Mayotte football teams, among others). Teams representing states with limited recognition, former states, dependent territories, autonomous areas, or regional, sub-national, ethnic, cultural, diaspora, immigrant, language, and micronational groups, many of which were created in the early 21st Century, play in friendly matches and international tournaments against each other, without recognition or approval from FIFA or any of its associated confederations. Several organizations not associated with FIFA have been in charge of these "national" team tournaments, some of which have included participants from all over the world (such as the Island Games, UNPO Cup, VIVA World Cup, and ConIFA World Football Cup), while others have been limited to a specific geographical area (such as the ConIFA regional tournaments, the Europeada, and the CSANF Cup.) The Confederation of Independent Football Associations (ConIFA), was founded with the aim of giving teams without sanctioning from FIFA an opportunity to participate in international football. This developed the work of the now-defunct N.F.-Board (Nouvelle Fédération-Board), founded in 2001, which also organised football tournaments between FIFA-unrecognised teams. ConIFA aims to help unrecognised national teams gain recognition, but also to provide a platform for representative teams of regions or diasporas, which do not have a place in a system of international football based on nation-states. As of August 2021, 59 member associations from all over the world are affiliared with ConIFA. These national teams no longer exist due to the dissolution of the nation or territory that they represented. While historically there have existed national teams without FIFA membership which are now defunct (such as the Manchukuo and North Vietnam teams), only national teams that have held FIFA membership at some point in the past are listed on the following table. In addition to the above, other teams have been renamed:  Congo →  Congo-Léopoldville in 1960 →  Congo-Kinshasa in 1963 →  Zaire in 1971 →  DR Congo in 1997 British Gambia →  Gambia in 1965  British Guiana →  Guyana in 1966  Burma →  Myanmar in 1989  Cambodia →  Khmer Republic in 1970 →  Kampuchea in 1975 →  Cambodia in 1979  Ceylon →  Sri Lanka in 1972  Curaçao →  Netherlands Antilles in 1958 until 2010  Czechoslovakia →  Representation of Czechs and Slovaks in 1993  Czech Republic →  Czechia in 2022  Dahomey →  Benin in 1975  Dutch East Indies →  Indonesia in 1945  Egypt →  United Arab Republic in 1958 →  Egypt in 1971  FR Yugoslavia →  Serbia and Montenegro in 2003  FYR Macedonia →  North Macedonia in 2019  French Somaliland →  Djibouti in 1977  French Togoland →  Togo in 1960  Germany →  Germany FR in 1945 →  Germany in 1990  Gold Coast →  Ghana in 1957  Irish Free State →  Ireland in 1936 →  Republic of Ireland in 1954  Ivory Coast →  Côte d'Ivoire in 1983  Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes →  Yugoslavia in 1929 Madagascar →  Malagasy Republic in 1958 →  Madagascar in 1975  Mandatory Palestine →  Israel in 1948 Middle Congo →  Congo-Brazzaville in 1960 →  PR Congo in 1970 →  Congo in 1992  New Hebrides →  Vanuatu in 1980  Northern Rhodesia →  Zambia in 1964  Nyasaland →  Malawi in 1966 Portuguese Guinea →  Guinea-Bissau in 1975  China →  Taiwan in 1954 →  Chinese Taipei in 1980  Southern Rhodesia →  Rhodesia in 1964 →  Zimbabwe in 1980 Surinam →  Suriname in 1954  Swaziland →  Eswatini in 2018  Turkey →  Türkiye in 2022  Upper Volta →  Burkina Faso in 1984  Vietnam →  South Vietnam in 1955  Western Samoa →  Samoa in 1997 Some ConIFA members represent regions which existed as sovereign states in the past, but were never members of FIFA or one of its associated regional confederations. Examples include the Artsakh, Biafra, and East Turkestan national football teams. Additionally, 22 nations in Africa and Asia belong to the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA) in addition to their respective regional confederations. Guyana and Suriname are independent countries, and French Guiana is an overseas department and region of France The FIFA-affiliated football teams that belong to non-UN members are: Association football portal Geography of association football List of FIFA country codes List of women's national association football teams List of association football competitions Brown, Michael.
