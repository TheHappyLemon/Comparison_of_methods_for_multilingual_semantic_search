He was first editor in chief of Džuboks (i.e. Jukebox) magazine and once arranged visas for Zlatni Dečaci by representing the band members as young chess players. He organized the first concert of YU grupa and featured in YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike. His radio show Nedeljom u devet i pet (Sunday at 9:05), which he produced and hosted, introduced bands such as Samonikli. In Memoriam - IM Nikola Karaklajić. FIDE.
