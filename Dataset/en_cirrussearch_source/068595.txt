Bryan Tetsadong Marceau Mbeumo (/ˈbər.moʊ/ BƏR-moh; born 7 August 1999) is a professional footballer who plays as a right winger or forward for Premier League club Brentford and the Cameroon national team. Mbeumo is a product of the Troyes academy and began his senior career with the club. He transferred to Brentford in 2019 and was a part of the squad which was promoted to the Premier League in 2021. Mbeumo was capped by France at youth international level and made his full international debut for Cameroon in 2022. He was a member of Cameroon's 2022 World Cup squad. A left-footed winger with a preference for playing on the right, Mbeumo joined Troyes AC at the age of 14 and graduated to the club's reserve team in the 2016–17 season. He was a part of the Troyes U19 team which won the 2018 Coupe Gambardella and scored twice in the final at the Stade de France. Mbeumo made his senior debut for the club in a 1–0 Ligue 1 win over FC Metz on 17 February 2018 and made three further appearances during the 2017–18 season, which culminated in relegation to Ligue 2. The relegation allowed Mbeumo to break into the first team squad and he made 40 appearances and scored 11 goals during the 2018–19 season, which ended with defeat in the Ligue 2 promotion play-off semi-finals. He departed the Stade de l'Aube in August 2019, after making 46 appearances and scoring 12 goals for the club. On 5 August 2019, Mbeumo moved to England to join Championship club Brentford on a five-year contract for a club record £5.8 million fee. He made 47 appearances and scored 16 goals during the 2019–20 season, which ended with defeat in the 2020 Championship play-off final. Mbeumo's performances were recognised with a nomination for the EFL Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year awards at the 2020 London Football Awards. Mbeumo's goal tally dropped off during a "difficult" COVID-19-affected 2020–21 season, but by March 2021, his 10 assists and four goals saw him again nominated for the EFL Player of the Year award at the 2021 London Football Awards. Mbeumo finished Brentford's 2021 Championship play-off final-winning 2020–21 season with 49 appearances and eight goals. Mbeumo was deployed as a forward alongside Ivan Toney early in the 2021–22 season and by his 11th Premier League appearance, he had scored two goals and hit the woodwork seven times. Mbeumo's first hat-trick of his career (scored in a 4–1 FA Cup third round win over Port Vale on 8 January 2022) was also the first scored by a substitute in Brentford history and earned him a place in the Team of the Round and a nomination for Player of the Round. Three weeks later, he signed a new four-year contract, with a one-year option. Mbeumo ended the 2021–22 season with 38 appearances, eight goals and he tied with Raphinha for the record of most woodwork hits during the Premier League season, with seven. During the 2022–23 pre-season friendlies, Mbeumo proved his versatility by at times being deployed as a wing back in a 3-4-3 formation. He was an ever-present in league matches during the season and made 39 appearances in all competitions, scoring 9 goals. Mbeumo's 9 goals (all scored in league matches) more than doubled that of the previous season, with head coach Thomas Frank remarking that Mbeumo "has grown more and more to be a key player for us. He works very hard on his finishing". Starting the 2023–24 season on the right hand side of a front three alongside Yoane Wissa and Kevin Schade, Mbeumo's five goals across seven appearances in August and October 2023 saw him nominated for the Premier League Player of the Month award for each month. He scored two further goals before missing three months after undergoing surgery on a "bad" ankle injury suffered during a 2–1 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion on 6 December. Mbeumo won 10 caps and scored one goal for France at U17, U20 and U21 level. In August 2022, following a meeting in London with Samuel Eto'o, Mbeumo declared his senior international allegiance to the Cameroon national team. He made 9 appearances and scored one goal during the 2022–23 season, with three appearances coming during Cameroon's 2022 World Cup campaign, prior to the team's group stage exit. After appearing in three of Cameroon's four 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches and scoring one goal, injury ruled Mbeumo out of the final tournament. Mbeumo is Cameroonian by his father, who is from the western region of Cameroon and his mother is French. In June 2020, he tested positive for COVID-19, but showed no symptoms and missed one match.
