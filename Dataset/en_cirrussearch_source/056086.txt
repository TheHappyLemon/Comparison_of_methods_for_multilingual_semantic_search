Coburg Island (Inuktitut: Nirjutiqavvik) is an uninhabited island in Qikiqtaaluk, Nunavut, Canada. It is one of the members of Queen Elizabeth Islands located in Baffin Bay's Lady Ann Strait. It is separated from Ellesmere Island by Glacier Strait; Devon Island is to the south. Elsewhere in Nunavut, there is also a tiny Saxe-Coburg Island, lying in Davis Strait, south of Leopold Island, itself east of Baffin Island's Cape Mercy (Cumberland Peninsula). The island is characterized by cliffs, rocky shores, and tundra. Bowhead whale, narwhal, polar bear, seal, walrus, and white whale frequent the area. Coburg Island has several designated conservation classifications including International Biological Program site and Key Migratory Bird Terrestrial Habitat site. Along with the surrounding marine area, the island is a part of the Nirjutiqavvik National Wildlife Area. Cambridge Point, off of the southeastern Marina Peninsula, is a Canadian Important Bird Area notable for black guillemot, black-legged kittiwake, glaucous gull, northern fulmar, and thick-billed murre. A portion of Cambridge Point is within the NWA. "Nunavut National Wildlife Area Facts". cws-scf.ec.gc.ca. 2005-06-21. Retrieved 2009-04-24.[dead link] "Cambridge Point". bsc-eoc.org.
