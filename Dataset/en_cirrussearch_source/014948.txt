The men's basketball tournament at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, began on 29 July and ended on 12 August, when the United States defeated Spain 107–100 for the gold medal. All preliminary games were held at the Basketball Arena within the Olympic Park, while the knockout matches took place at The O2 Arena (renamed North Greenwich Arena due to IOC's no-commercialisation policy). Twelve qualified nations were drawn into two groups, each consisting of six teams. Each game result merits a corresponding point: *The team has fewer than two players available to play on the court at some point during the game. **A team cannot put forward at least five players at the start of the game, or its own actions prevent play from being resumed. In case teams are tied on points, the tiebreaking criteria are used, in order of first application: Results of the games involving the tied teams (head-to-head records) Goal average of the games involving the tied teams Goal average of all of the games played Points scored Drawing of lots The teams with the four best records qualified for the knockout stage, which was a single-elimination tournament.
