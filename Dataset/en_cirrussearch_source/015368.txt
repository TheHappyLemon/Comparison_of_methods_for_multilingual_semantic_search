The 2014 FIBA World Championship for Women, the 17th edition of FIBA's premier international tournament for women's national basketball teams, was held in Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey from 27 September to 5 October 2014. This tournament implemented the new expanded free throw lane, the restricted arc, and extended 3-point line (6.6–6.75 m). The United States defended their title and won their ninth overall gold medal by beating Spain 77–64 in the final.Australia defeated Turkey 74–44 to capture the bronze medal. This was the last FIBA championship to use the name of "FIBA World Championship for Women". Shortly after the event, FIBA changed the name of the competition to the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, presumably to align its name with that of the corresponding men's competition. This years' competition saw a format change. The 16 teams were split into four groups of four teams and played each other in a round-robin system. After all games were played, the top team of each group advanced to the quarterfinals, while the 2nd and 3rd best team of each group played in an elimination round. The last placed team of each group was eliminated. The winners of the elimination round advanced to the quarterfinals, while the losers were eliminated. From the quarterfinals on a knockout stage was used to determine the winner. The places 1 to 8 will be played out. 16 teams took part in the 2014 World Championship for Women. After the 2012 Olympics, the continental allocation for FIBA Americas was reduced by one when the United States won the Olympic tournament, automatically qualifying them for the 2014 World Championship. The draw was held on 15 March 2014. The 16 teams were allocated to four pots of four teams.
