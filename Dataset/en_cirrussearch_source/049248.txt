Wrestling at the 1932 Summer Olympics was held between August 1–7 August at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. It was split into two disciplines, Freestyle and Greco-Roman which were further divided into different weight categories. Wrestling events consisted of a series of random matches and a system of points to decide elimination after each round. Matches were scored as follows: The results of the bouts were counted on "bad points". Losers received 3 points for each bout lost, those who won by decision of the jury received 1 point, and those who won by pin received 0 points. Those competitors who accumulated 5 bad points were eliminated. If candidates for the third place were eliminated with equal bad points in the same round, they were paired, if they have not yet met each other, for the third place. 18 nations participated in Wrestling at the 1932 Olympics:  Australia (1)  Austria (1)  Canada (6)  Czechoslovakia (2)  Denmark (3)  Estonia (1)  Finland (10)  France (5)  Germany (5)  Great Britain (2)  Greece (2)  Hungary (5)  Italy (6)  Japan (7)  Mexico (2)  Norway (1)  Sweden (13)  United States (7) "Wrestling at the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Games".
