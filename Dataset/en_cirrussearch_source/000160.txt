Jēgers came from a poor family and in the first years he played football barefoot with a "ball" made from papers and old clothes in the street.[citation needed] At the age of 16 he caught the attention of the trade-union football team. He soon emerged as a very talented footballer and his popularity was on the rise as he scored the single late goal in the victory for his team against the renowned Rīgas FK.[citation needed] In 1939, Jēgers played his single international football match for Latvia. In 1940. when Latvian sports life was reorganized according to Soviet standards,[citation needed] Jēgers played for Dinamo Riga with which he went on a tourney to Moscow, Kiev and Tbilisi.[citation needed] After the German occupation, Nazis sent him to Stutthof concentration camp where Jēgers caught typhus and was close to death.[citation needed] However, he survived and after the end of World War II he returned to both football and ice hockey. From 1946 to 1948, he played football with Dinamo Riga, when it was merged with Daugava Rīga he became a player of Daugava. From 1950 to 1952, he was the captain of Daugava. In 1950, he was given the title Master of Sports in hockey. In 1951, he was awarded the title Merited Master of Sports and was recognized as the best goal scorer for the club in the Soviet Top League. Jēgers had to retire from football when, after the 1952 season, Daugava was relegated from the top league and in the whole season Jēgers hadn't scored a single goal.[citation needed] In ice hockey Jēgers made a career only after World War II when he became a player with Dinamo Rīga.
