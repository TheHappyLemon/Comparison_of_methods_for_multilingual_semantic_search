Serigne Modou Kara Mbodji (born 22 November 1989), commonly known as Kara or Kara Mbodji, is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays for the Senegal national team. He can be deployed as a defender, defensive midfielder or in the central midfield. At the age of 15, Mbodji joined the Diambars academy in Dakar, Senegal. On 2 February 2010, he joined Norwegian club Tromsø IL. During his three seasons in the Norwegian Premier League, he was awarded best player of his team and twice second best player of the Championship. On 31 December 2012, Mbodji joined KRC Genk for a fee of €1.4 million. After regularly starting for Genk in defence and winning the 2012–13 Belgian Cup, his contract was extended until June 2018. On 7 August 2015, he joined R.S.C. Anderlecht for a fee of €4.5 million, signing a four-year deal until June 2019. In August 2017, he agreed a contract extension with the club until 2020. In his time at the club he made 97 appearances scoring 7 goals. On 30 August 2018, one day before the closing of the 2018 summer transfer window, Mbodji moved to Ligue 1 side FC Nantes on loan for the 2018–19 season. Nantes also secured an option to sign him permanently. His loan ended early, in January 2019, with Mbodji citing lack of playing time.
