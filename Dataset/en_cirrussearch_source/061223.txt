He entered the match as a substitute for Héctor Moreno, who suffered an injury in a slide-tackle with Arjen Robben. In May 2018, Reyes was named in Mexico's squad for the World Cup, despite being at the time in recovery from a hamstring injury, he was subsequently ruled out of the tournament after not having satisfactory progress. Reyes has been described as "intelligent in his positioning, comfortable in possession and strong in the air", as well as being praised for "his ability to time challenges play crisp passes and keep possession when under pressure".
