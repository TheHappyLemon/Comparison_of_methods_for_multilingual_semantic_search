Vracov (Czech pronunciation: [ˈvratsof]) is a town in Hodonín District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 4,500 inhabitants. The town's name is derived from the personal name Vrac, which is an obsolete diminutive of the name Vratislav. Vracov is located about 14 kilometres (9 mi) northeast of Hodonín. Larger part of the municipal territory lies in a flat landscape of the Lower Morava Valley. The northern hilly part lies in the Kyjov Hills and include the highest point of Vracov, a hill at 311 m (1,020 ft) above sea level. Vracovský Pond is located on the outskirts of the town. The first written mention of Vracov is from 1201. In the 1230s, it was owned by Queen Constance of Hungary. Vracov was a royal property, but the development of neighbouring Bzenec reduced its importance. In 1310, Vracov became a part of the Bzenec estate and shared its owners since then. In 1517, Vracov was promoted to a market town. Vracov became a town in 1967. Vracov is located on the railway lines Brno–Staré Město and Kyjov–Veselí nad Moravou. The main landmark of Vracov is the Church of Saint Lawrence. It was probably founded by Constance of Hungary in the 1230s. A Renaissance tower was added in 1565. The church was baroque rebuilt in 1722. Two valuable baroque statues stand in front of the entrance – the statue of St. Florian from 1769 and St. John of Nepomuk from 1780. The second cultural monument in the town is a small Neoclassical chapel dedicated to St. Anne. It dates from the first half of the 19th century.
