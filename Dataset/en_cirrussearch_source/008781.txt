Teenage Dream is the third studio album by American singer Katy Perry. It was released on August 24, 2010, through Capitol Records. Primarily a pop record, Teenage Dream also contains elements of disco, electronic, rock, funk, house, Hi-NRG, and hip hop, that revolve around young love, partying, self-empowerment, and personal growth. Perry co-wrote the album, and worked with a number of producers such as Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Benny Blanco, Stargate and Greg Wells. With "California Gurls", "Teenage Dream", "Firework", "E.T.", and "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)", Teenage Dream is the second album in history to have five number-one singles (after Michael Jackson's 1987 album Bad) to top the US Billboard Hot 100, and the first by a woman to achieve this milestone. Its sixth single, "The One That Got Away", peaked at number three on that chart. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 192,000 copies in its first week. The album was later certified nine times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined album sales, track sales, on-demand audio and video streams equivalent of nine million album-sale units. The album has gone onto sell 3.1 million copies in the United States, and charted within the Top 40 of the Billboard 200 year-end chart three years in a row. The album also sold 1.3 million copies in the United Kingdom, where it was certified five times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Upon its release, Teenage Dream received mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented its themes but were divided over its production and Perry's vocals. However, retrospective reviews have praised the album, ranking it on multiple decade-end best albums lists. Billboard named Teenage Dream "one of the defining LPs from a new golden age in mega-pop" and The A.V. Club called the album "pop perfection". The album and its singles earned Perry seven Grammy Award nominations including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Record of the Year. It also won International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2011. All six of the aforementioned singles, in addition to two from its 2012 reissue Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, have sold over two million digital downloads each in the US, setting a record in the digital era for the most multi-Platinum singles from one album, breaking the previous record of Fergie's debut album, The Dutchess (2006), which had five multi-Platinum songs. To promote the album, Perry embarked on the California Dreams Tour from 2011 to 2012. By July 2013, Teenage Dream had sold 6 million copies worldwide. "We worked in Santa Barbara, we worked in Los Angeles. I was telling everybody I had a lot of jewels, but I didn't have the crown, and then I finally got the crown so all the jewels made sense. And now I have this thing, this crown that I'm ready to present." —Perry on Teenage Dream Following the success of her breakthrough album One of the Boys (2008), Perry did not want her next record to alienate her fanbase, opting to "definitely keep it pop" and not shift her style, believing it would show "whether I'm meant to do this, or I got lucky". In a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, she revealed that the album would focus on the "whirlwind" last year of her life, dealing with her newfound fame, friendships, relationships, further stating that "I'm not just gonna talk about the beat and just dancing, I like to get into the meaning". At that point, the singer described the new lyrics as "very honest, if not more honest than the last ones. But they are a little bit more mature... I know how to handle boys now". Perry also wanted the album to have more tempo than One of the Boys to make her live shows more dynamic. She explained: "I really love going to shows where I'm sandwiched between people, and you don’t know if the sweat on you is yours or the person's next to you. I love that feeling, and when I was on tour I would see that I was missing that a bit". Recording sessions for Teenage Dream began in autumn 2009 and took place at a multitude of recording studios in the United States. Work on the album involved collaborating with numerous artists and producers including Dr. Luke, Greg Wells, Guy Sigsworth, Max Martin, Ryan Tedder, Rivers Cuomo, Kuk Harrell, Greg Kurstin, Benny Blanco, Darkchild, Cathy Dennis, Esther Dean, and Tricky Stewart, who told Rap-Up in December 2009 that the sound of the album would be pop and rock, like One of the Boys, though calling it a "different gear" for himself. Perry also desired to collaborate with Calvin Harris on the record, "but he got really famous so it didn't happen". According to Luke, Perry gave him a mixtape of songs which inspired her in order to demonstrate how she wanted the next record to sound. The singer also claimed that working with Martin and Luke was "a wonderful collaborative effort". As for the visual component, the singer likens it to "going from Shirley Temple, Betty Boop to more of a Betty Paige [sic], pop art-sarcastic-fun-Lichtenstein picture: still bright, but the colors are more saturated, and it's more metallic fuchsia or purple than bubblegum pink." Perry stated about the album "You're getting the sugary sweet but you're also getting the 'Oh my goodness, she had to sit down for a minute and let things off her chest'". The music of Teenage Dream is derived from a wide variety of pop genres, while heavily incorporating different musical styles not heard on her previous releases; disco and electronic are examples. Musically, Teenage Dream is considered to be a departure from One of the Boys (2008), which was pop rock and soft rock driven. The album features a very wide range of rock subgenres, which include disco rock, glam metal, indie rock, pop rock, hard rock, electronic rock, and goth rock. The album opens with the title track "Teenage Dream", which is written as a throwback record to Perry's teenage years. It is a power pop and electropop song which features a "distinct retro sound", and contains influences of disco, pop rock, and industrial music. The song has been compared to several disco artists, including Madonna and the Cardigans. The second song is "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)", the song recalls a true experience that Perry had while partying in Santa Barbara which included streaking in a park, dancing on tables, and partying at a club. Musically, the song is styled in the genres of disco, indie rock, and Hi-NRG, while also taking influence from dance-pop. Its third track "California Gurls" continues the "retro sound" carried from "Teenage Dream", and is written as an answer song to "Empire State of Mind" by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, and pays tribute to the beach lifestyle of California. The song utilizes the genres of disco, funk-pop, and electropop, while bearing influence of new wave music within its composition. Teenage Dream's fourth track is the self-empowerment song "Firework". Written in a disco-rock style which runs over the backing track, it consists of a mix of violins and house music. The song has generated comparisons to artists such as Coldplay and Leona Lewis. According to Perry, "Firework" was inspired by Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road, and she has said on many occasions that it is her favorite song from the album. "Peacock" is a dance-pop song, with an up-tempo house music beat. Lyrically, the track contains a double entendre with suggestive wording. New York magazine writer Willa Paskin observed that Perry did the obvious with the song's hook ("she used a common word for penis and made it mean penis!"). Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone thought of "Peacock" as a sequel to Gwen Stefani's 2005 single "Hollaback Girl" by noticing the two songs shared a drum hook. The album follows with "Circle the Drain", a disco-rock song where, lyrically, Perry is telling off a self-destructive drug-addicted ex-boyfriend. Its candid lyrics also discuss the strains his addiction put on both of them. In the track's chorus, she sings about how she wants to be his lover, not someone who has to take care of him, such as a maternal figure. She also sings about how he had ultimately lost large opportunities. The song is styled in the genres of disco-rock, and gothic rock tones. Following this track is "The One That Got Away", which is a rock and pop ballad. Perry stated that she wrote the song "about when you promise someone forever, but you end up not being able to follow through. It's a bittersweet story. Hopefully, the listener learns from hearing it and never has to say they had "the one" get away." The eighth song, "E.T." is a song about "falling in love with a foreigner". A remix of the song features Kanye West. Musically, the track is an electronic and hip hop ballad influenced by drum and bass, rave, and techno. The eleventh track, "Hummingbird Heartbeat", was inspired by Perry's boyfriend at the time, Russell Brand. Musically, it is a 1980s-styled hard rock song that contains a mixture of elements from rock and electronica. Lyrically, the song compares the feeling of being in love to the speed of a hummingbird's heartbeat. The last track is "Not Like the Movies" a power ballad about a love relationship where a woman does not feel in love and still waits for the man of her dreams, or "charming prince", as a Terra reviewer put it. Its melody was compared to Britney Spears' "Everytime" (2003) and Evanescence's "My Immortal" (2003). On June 14, 2010, a beach-themed listening party took place in New York, where a number of tracks from the album were played. Before the album's release, "Not Like the Movies", "Circle the Drain", and "E.T." were made available exclusively on iTunes Store as a countdown to Teenage Dream. Capitol Records first released Teenage Dream in the United States and Canada on August 24, 2010, as a standard and deluxe edition, which contained remixes of "California Gurls" and "Teenage Dream". A two-CD edition titled Dream On was later released, consisting of a CD featuring the 12 original tracks, plus another one with two tracks on which Perry had previously appeared as a featured artist — 3OH!3's "Starstrukk" and Timbaland's "If We Ever Meet Again", and remixes of "California Gurls" and "Teenage Dream". The album was distributed by EMI Music Japan on August 25 in Japan, and released three days later in the United Kingdom. Teenage Dream was eventually released worldwide on August 30, 2010 by EMI. It will be re-released on October 20, 2023 as a two-edition vinyl. The album's title was revealed as Teenage Dream in May 2010, with Perry explaining it was named after a song on the album she wrote on her hometown in Santa Barbara, which "kind of exudes this euphoric feeling like everyone remembers what their teenage dreams were", Perry explained. The title attracted controversy as it had a similar title to duo Beach House's Teen Dream, released earlier that year; a member of the duo addressed the issue on Twitter, writing they "can't believe this, and not in a good way", further tweeting that "guess we have to write a song called 'i kiss a girl'", referring to a song with similar title by Perry, "I Kissed a Girl". Their fans also reacted by posting comments on Perry's Wikipedia page, including one that read: "Mrs. Perry's album title may or may not be ripping off the brilliant indie duo Beach House and their critically acclaimed record Teen Dream. It will be a challenge for her to achieve the same aural masterpiece". The album cover, which shows Perry lying naked on clouds of pink cotton candy, was painted on a 6x6 canvas by Will Cotton and revealed on July 21, 2010. Perry first approached Cotton in early 2010, asking him if paintings from his "Cotton Candy Clouds" series, which depicted pinup girls laying nude in a pink sky, were available for purchase. After viewing photographs from Perry's One of the Boys album, he instead suggested she pose for a painting, as he thought Perry had the same pin-up burlesque style he looked for in a model. He baptized the artwork as Cotton Candy Katy, and later art directed the music video for "California Gurls". She explained the reason on choosing a painting for the cover: "Maybe CDs will be extinct next time I put out the album…so I wanted to go out with a bang for people to remember this. I think our collaboration will make it memorable". Perry decided not to include her name or the album's title on the cover and stated, "Hopefully they know it's me by the actual picture". A limited number of copies carried a cotton candy scent, described by MTV News' Kyle Anderson as "not unlike that artificial bubblegum smell you sometimes get". Promotion for the album began with a live performance of "California Gurls" on May 20, 2010, at the CW networks' annual "upfronts" presentation in New York. Perry later performed the track at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards alongside Dogg; MTV News described the performance as "postcard come to life", with the singer taking style notes from "1950s 'greetings from' state postcards, I-t-t-t-totally-love-the-'80s fluorescents, a little 1960s sci-fi", as well as "a dash of 1970s Wonder Woman flair". Before the performance, MTV had tweeted that the singer would appear naked on stage, which let Perry upset. She also promoted the song that same month on Le Grand Journal, and on the fifth season of Germany's Next Topmodel. The Candyland theme from the "California Gurls" video was used in the performance at the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards; she had previously stated that her performance would be different from the music video, as it would not feature "cupcake boobies". In July, Perry performed at the MTV World Stage Live in Malaysia with a set that included lifesize cupcakes, backing singers dressed like candy canes and Perry wearing a white glitter unitard and tutu; during her set, the singer premiered "Peacock". The next month, she opened the 2010 Teen Choice Awards with a rendition of "Teenage Dream" with cheerleaders, jocks, and dancers surrounding her on stage. During a promotional visit to Australia, Perry performed a small concert for Sunrise. On the album's release day in the United States, she appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and gave a small concert and performed several tracks from the album along with older songs. The rendition was broadcast live across the web. Two days later, the singer appeared at Rockefeller Plaza for Today and sang "California Gurls" and "Teenage Dream". She then made a return to Le Grand Journal to perform the title track. In September, Perry made a rendition of "California Gurls" on X Factor Italia, and appeared on Alan Carr: Chatty Man in the United Kingdom. She was then the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. The next month, the singer went to Germany to perform at Wetten, dass..?, and then performed "Firework" on the seventh season of the British version of The X Factor. In November, at the 2010 MTV Europe Music Awards, Perry performed the same track. Days later, the singer made a special concert at New York's Roseland Ballroom to launch the Windows Phone 7, where she performed several songs from Teenage Dream. In London, Perry performed a small set of songs for the 2010 BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards. She finished November by performing at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2010, donning two different outfits for the event. At the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards which took place in February 2011, Perry performed "Not Like the Movies" and "Teenage Dream". The California Dreams Tour was officially announced in October 2010. Before the announcement, Perry had expressed she wanted her next concert tour to be very focused on visuals, and wanted it to be "10 times better" than her previous tour. She also stated that it would "engage all of your senses: sight, sound, smell, taste, touch". Baz Halpin was signed up as the tour director, and designed the show to be a "jukebox musical". It was originally designed as a essentially theater-based tour. However, as Perry's popularity grew, the tour was scaled up and revamped to accommodate larger venues. Robyn, Yelle, and Marina and the Diamonds served as opening acts for the concerts, which Perry described as "super girl power". The tour was a commercial success, and was ranked 16th in Pollstar's "2011 Top 25 Worldwide Tours", earning over $59.5 million. At the conclusion of 2011, it ranked 13th on Billboard's annual "Top 25 Tours", earning nearly $50 million with 98 shows. It won an award for Favorite Tour Headliner at the 38th People's Choice Awards. It was announced that the tour's stop at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on November 23, 2011 would be filmed for a future DVD release, but it was never released. "California Gurls" was the lead single from Teenage Dream, which features rapper Snoop Dogg. The single made its radio debut on May 7, 2010 and was digitally released four days later.

A dance remix of it was released on March 26, 2012. Teenage Dream received mixed reviews upon release from music critics. Giving the album 4 out of 5 stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that "There's no question Perry is smart enough to know every rule in pop but she's not inspired enough to ignore them, almost seeming nervous to break away from the de rigueur lite club beats that easily transition from day to night or the chilly, stainless-steel ballads designed to lose none of their luster on repeat plays." He felt that it contained "accents to her old One of the Boys palette" and distinguished itself through vulgar lyrics. Mikael Wood of Spin gave a mixed review, noting that the album "won't disappoint parents looking for reasons to worry about their kids". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described the album as "heavy on Eighties beats, light on melody, taking a long dip into the Daft Punk filter-disco house sound." Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune gave a negative review to the album. He criticized the production, calling it "Frankenstein-like", as well as calling Perry's vocals "robotic" and lacking "any elegance or nuance". Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine called it "over-produced bad-girl debauchery", claiming that Perry has "found a way to lower the bar". The Los Angeles Times gave it three stars, saying, "On "Teenage Dream," the songs alternate between weekend-bender celebrations of hedonism and self-help-style affirmations encouraging listeners to get an emotional makeover. Either way, acquisition is the goal: of a great love, a happy hangover, a perfect pair of Daisy Dukes". Leah Greenblatt, writing for Entertainment Weekly, stated, "beneath the fruity outfits and fart jokes, Perry is clearly serious about the business of hit songcraft; that doesn't make Dream nearly cohesive as an album, but it does provide, intermittently, exactly the kind of high-fructose rush she's aiming for." On the album's 10th anniversary, Patrick Gomez of The A.V. Club praised it as "pop perfection", writing that "the magic of the album is that it remains cohesive" and "the heightened emotions of teen love, lust, and self-discovery remain a constant throughout". Writing for Mass Live, Kevin O'Hare gave the album 3.5 stars out of five, praising its titular track and "California Gurls" for being "infectious" and "joyous [blasts] of nostalgia." Kevin O'Hare also "Who Am I Living For?" for Katy Perry's "powerhouse singing" and "Not Like the Movies", calling it a "delicately beautiful piano ballad", though he was far less favorable towards "The One That Got Away", criticizing the track as "fairly thin."

"Teenage Dream," "Last Friday Night," "California Gurls," "Firework" and "E.T."—five No. 1 songs in a row. Some pop stars spend their whole lives trying to put together a string of hits that amount to a lasting legacy; Katy Perry did it in the first 15 minutes. This album is a crowning achievement, not just of her career but of its style: EDM and disco and pop, bold and belting, entirely processed yet instantly recognizable, robust yet chintzy. — Anna Gaca of Pitchfork Teenage Dream achieved a multitude of records throughout its run. Perry scored five Billboard Hot 100 number one singles from Teenage Dream, making her the second artist in the chart's 53-year history to amass five number-one singles from one album over its first release after Michael Jackson achieved the feat with his 1987 album Bad. Perry is the first female in history to achieve this milestone. The album is one of only three albums to produce six or more top-five singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (along with Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 and George Michael's Faith), and the first album to have seven songs top the Dance Club Songs chart, breaking the previous record set by Beyoncé's I Am... Sasha Fierce and Kristine W's The Power of Music, both with six songs. Perry was able to replicate this success in the United Kingdom, breaking the Official Charts Company's record for the most Top 10 singles from one studio album by a female solo artist. Eight songs from Teenage Dream have topped Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart as well as the Mainstream Top 40 chart, both more than any other album in each respective chart's history. Additionally, with seven chart-toppers from "Waking Up in Vegas", Perry broke the record for the longest streak of number ones on the Mainstream Top 40 set by Lady Gaga's first six singles. The singles also allowed Perry to have an unprecedented 69-week long streak in the Hot 100's top-10, as well as a 71-week top-10 streak on the Airplay chart. Perry also has the most number-one singles (four) from one album to top the Canadian Hot 100. Combined, the songs have sold a total of over 35 million copies worldwide aside from the album. Also, the first five singles from the album topped the charts in the United States and attained top-10 positions in more than 20 countries. All five singles also topped the Digital and Airplay charts, making her the first artist ever to have five number-one singles in the Airplay chart. Perry became the only artist to spend over 52 consecutive weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, and later heightened this to 69 weeks, with the first five singles from album, breaking the 15-year long previous record held by Ace of Base of 48 weeks with three singles . On the Mainstream Top 40 the album holds the unique record in the chart's history to have four songs from the same album in the top five of "Most weekly plays"; 1. "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" (12,468), 2. "E.T." (12,361), 3. "California Gurls" (12,159), and 4. "Firework" (11,857). In a retrospective review of the Teenage Dream, Pitchfork called the album "a crowning achievement, not just of her career but of its style: EDM and disco and pop, bold and belting, entirely processed yet instantly recognizable, robust yet chintzy." uDiscover Music wrote that the album "holds an outsized influence on pop music landscape and the many artists she helped inspire" and that it along with the "Teenage Dream" song "lives on as a nostalgic spectacle that set the course for the pop icon's aesthetic". VH1 called Teenage Dream "the most important pop album of the last 10 years" and added "it surged a blend of silliness into the dance genre that had been dominated by Lady Gaga's Fame Monster edge". In an interview for Apple Music for her album If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power, American singer-songwriter Halsey called Teenage Dream the "perfect pop album", saying: "Anyone who's trying to make a perfect pop album is wasting their time because Katy already did it with Teenage Dream."
