Lopé-Okanda Ivindo The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Gabon accepted the convention on December 30, 1986, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, there are two World Heritage Sites in Gabon. There are two sites listed in Gabon, one of which was inscribed for natural and the other one for both natural and cultural significance. There are also six sites on the tentative list.
