The VEF I-14 was a Latvian Air Force trainer aircraft prototype, built by VEF. Kārlis Irbītis began work on the I-14 in 1936 in response to an order placed by the Latvian Air Force for a new trainer aircraft. Taking inspiration from Miles aircraft, the I-14 was a low-wing monoplane with fixed, conventional landing gear. The single pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit. It was powered by a 200 hp Menasco B6S Buccaneer. The I-14 made its maiden flight on 19 November 1937. On 23 April 1938, the aircraft was destroyed in a crash, its pilot, Bandenieks, was unhurt. Development of the I-14 was abandoned in favor of the more advanced VEF I-15.
