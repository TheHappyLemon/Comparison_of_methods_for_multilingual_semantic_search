The Canada men's national basketball team (French: Équipe du Canada de basketball masculin) represents Canada in international basketball competitions since 1923. They are overseen by Canada Basketball, the governing body for basketball in Canada. In nine Olympic appearances, Canada has won one medal in basketball – a silver at the 1936 Games in Berlin. The team finished fourth in 1976 and 1984. Canada has won six medals at the FIBA AmeriCup – two silver medals in 1980 and 1999, as well as four bronze medals in 1984, 1988, 2001, and 2015. In recent decades, the team also won its first medals at the Pan American Games, a silver medal in 2015, and the FIBA World Cup, a bronze medal in 2023. The Canadian senior national team won its only gold medal at a university-level tournament, the 1983 Summer Universiade, which the country hosted in Edmonton, Alberta. As the country credited for bringing forth the inventor of the game, Canada's national team has often been a major competitor at the global stage. Through the 70s and 80s, Team Canada consistently placed among the top teams in the world. The emergence of Steve Nash gave another boost to the team in the 1990s. Yet, great performances became more scarce when he retired. Canada began the new cycle entering the 2009 FIBA Americas Championship. Canada advanced to the quarterfinals, after posting a 2–2 record in the Preliminary round. A Uruguay loss to Argentina on the final day of group play meant that the winner of the Canada-Dominican Republic game would advance to the semifinals. Canada would go on to defeat them 76–80. In the semi-finals, Canada would lose to top-seeded Brazil 73–65. By finishing in the top four, this guaranteed the team a place in the 2010 FIBA World Championship held in Turkey. Canada unfortunately finished last (6th) of the Group D, and got ranked 22nd of the FIBA World Cup. Critics blamed the absence of Steve Nash, Samuel Dalembert, Jamaal Magloire and Matt Bonner for Canada's disappointing performance at the 2010 FIBA World Championship. Ambitions to gather Canada's most outstanding basketball players for the 2010 squad failed as Nash retired from the national team in 2007, Bonner did not get his citizenship in time, Dalembert was cut from the team after issues with former head coach Rautins and Magloire simply opted not to play. With a spot at the 2012 Summer Olympics up for grabs, Canada entered the 2011 FIBA Americas Championship with aspiration of making the quarterly tournament for the first time since 2000. Canada would ultimately bow out in the Second round of group play, and miss out on both a direct ticket to Beijing and the 2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament. On May 9, 2012, Steve Nash was named general manager of the national team of Canada. After a disappointing showing at the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship, Team Canada would not find success until the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship. In the tournament, Canada advanced to the semi-finals where they were defeated by Venezuela in a nail-bitting 78–79 loss. In the third-place game, they would defeat Mexico 87–86 to claim the bronze medal. With there 3rd place showing at the FIBA Americas Championship, Canada qualified to the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament – Manila. Needing to finish first to qualify for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Canada would advance all the way to the finals to face France. In front of a crown of 13,000, at the Mall of Asia Arena, Canada would fall 74–83 and miss out on yet another Summer Olympics. After failing to qualify for the Olympics, Canada participated at the 2017 FIBA AmeriCup in South America. The team was composed mostly of non-NBA players, and ended group play with a 1–2 record. The poor performance led them to finishing in 8th place. The Canadians made their debut at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast, winning a silver medal. With the approaching 2019 FIBA World Cup, Rowan Barrett hired Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse to coach Team Canada through the World Cup and possibly the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The team withdrew from its FIBA AmeriCup qualifying games against Cuba on November 29, 2020, and against the U.S. Virgin Islands on November 30, 2020, on the advice of medical experts due to risks posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence on January 20, 2021, the International Basketball Federation docked the team a point in the standings in addition to a 160,000 Swiss francs fine levied against Canada Basketball. At the 18th edition of the FIBA Basketball World Cup, Canada was drawn in Group H, with Australia, Lithuania, and Senegal. Canada finished in 21st place, their second worst showing at the men's international tournament. Canada had one last change to qualify for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, participating at the 2020 FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments – Victoria. Canada began the Preliminary round finishing with a 2–0 record, advancing to the semi-finals were they would face Czech Republic. A closely fought game, Canada would ultimately fall 101–103 in OT, missing out on the Summer Games for a 5th straight tournament. After numerous setbacks in tournament play, Canada Basketball introduced the concept of the 'Summer Core' consisting of 14 players who were willing to commit to represent Canada for three consecutive summers. This included the 2023 FIBA World Cup and participation at the 2024 Summer Olympics, where the Canadian men are making their first appearance since Nash led them to Sydney in 2000. In 2022, the Canadians participated at the 19th edition of the FIBA AmeriCup. They finished group play in second place with a 2–1 record. In the quarter-finals, Canada defeated Mexico 77–82. In the semi-finals, they were defeated by Brazil 86–76. They ended the tournament finishing in 4th place, after a narrow 84–80 loss to the United States, in the third place game. Dalano Banton, one of the standouts of the tournament, was named to the All-Tournament Team. On June 27, 2023, Sacramento Kings assistant coach Jordi Fernández was hired to replace Nick Nurse as Team Canada's head coach. Leading up to the 2023 FIBA World Cup, Canada Basketball announced a five-game exhibition series where they would play matches in Germany and Spain, against some of the top nations in the world. Canada finished the exhibition tour with a 3–2 record, which included wins over Germany and Spain, both of which were higher-ranked. Canada carried their form into the group phase of the World Cup, defeating France 95–65 in the opening match. Canada finished the first group phase with a 3–0 record, and a +111 point differential, following large wins over Lebanon and Latvia. However, the team suffered their first loss of the tournament to Brazil in the first game of the second stage. The loss meant that their next match against world number one ranked Spain, was a game Canada had to win if they hoped to gain an automatic berth at the 2024 Olympics. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led a fourth quarter comeback from 12 points down, as Canada edged the defending World champions in an 88–85 victory. The win secured a quarter-final spot and Canada's first Olympic berth since 2000. Canada then defeated Slovenia in the quarter-final by a score of 100–89, reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup for the first time. After a loss to Serbia in the semi-final, Canada defeated the United States in the bronze medal game, which went to overtime and concluded 127–118. Dillon Brooks recorded a team-best 39 points in the game, which secured the team's first global championship medal since 1936. Gilgeous-Alexander became the first Canadian to be named to the World Cup All-Tournament Team, while Brooks received the Best Defensive Player award. The team was subsequently named Team of the Year by The Canadian Press. 2018 – Silver 2000 – 4th place 2007 – 3rd place 2009 – 3rd place 2011 – 4th place 2013 – 5th place 2015 – Champions 1983 – Gold 1985 – Bronze 1991 – Silver 1993 – Silver 1995 – Bronze 1997 – Silver 2003 – Bronze 2007 – Bronze 2011 – Silver   Win   Loss   Fixture Argentina  v  Canada Venezuela  v  Canada Germany  v  Canada Canada  v  New Zealand Germany  v  Canada Spain  v  Canada Canada  v  Dominican Republic Canada  v  France Lebanon  v  Canada Canada  v  Latvia Canada  v  Brazil Spain  v  Canada Canada  v  Slovenia Serbia  v  Canada United States  v  Canada Roster for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.
