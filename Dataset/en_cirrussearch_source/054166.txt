Bukayo Ayoyinka Temidayo Saka (born 5 September 2001) is an English professional footballer who plays as a right winger for Premier League club Arsenal and the England national team. He is regarded as one of the best wingers in the world. Saka has spent his entire first-team club career with Arsenal, where he has won an FA Cup and two FA Community Shields, progressively becoming one of Arsenal's most influential players. Following both the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons, he was named as Arsenal's Player of the Season. Saka represented England at various youth levels before making his debut for the senior team in October 2020. He was part of England's squads for UEFA Euro 2020, which England finished as runners-up, and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Bukayo Ayoyinka Temidayo Saka was born on 5 September 2001 in Ealing, Greater London, to Yoruba Nigerian parents, Adenike and Yomi Saka, the younger of two children.

He attended Edward Betham Church of England Primary School before Greenford High School, where he gained high grades in his GCSEs, achieving four A*s and three As. Prior to joining Arsenal, Saka played youth football for local club Greenford Celtic. In an interview, Saka stated the importance of his father, Yomi, in his footballing career: "He's a massive inspiration for me. From when I was young, he always kept me grounded, kept me humble." His name "Bukayo" originates from the Yoruba language spoken in southern Nigeria, meaning "adds to happiness". Having previously played for youth teams of Watford, Saka joined Arsenal's Hale End academy at the age of seven. In 2020, Arsenal U16 coach Trevor Bumstead stated; "Bukayo always stood out in the younger teams. He was a fantastic decision maker.
