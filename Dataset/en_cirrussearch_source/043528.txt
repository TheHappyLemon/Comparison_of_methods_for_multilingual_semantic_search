More than half of Hollola's residents live in the municipal center in Salpakangas, and a good tenth in the villages of Kukkila and Kalliola. During the Continuation War, Hollola's municipality administration moved from the municipality of Hollola to the center of the city of Lahti and later moved to Salpakangas. The municipality's growth in the 1960s was mainly based on conservative economic policy. It enabled lower municipal taxes in Lahti and attracted companies and residents to Salpakangas. The center of Salpakkangas underwent major changes when Osuuskauppa Hämeenmaa built the Prisma market in the area, which was completed in 2017. An apartment building called Huili has been built in Salpakangas as a self-financed service home for the elderly. The banks of Hollola's Lake Päijänne have been inhabited since the Stone Age because of its fish population. During the Viking Age, Hollola developed into an important center, the most densely populated area of which was the Vainio region. Hollola also contains the Kirkailanmäki cemetery. After the Swedish crusade to Hämee and the establishmen of the Catholic Church in the area, Päijät-Hämee became a border region of the Swedish Empire. A chain of 13 ancient fortresses has been found in Finland, of which the hill fort Kapatuosia has been the most thoroughly studied. In addition to the ancient fortress of Kapatuosia, the Hankaa and Laitiala Kiiluanmäki fortresses are also found in Hollola. Their actual purpose is not exactly known, but it is suspected that they were part of a defense chain, a fire notification chain or places of escape for the local population. In the Middle Ages, Hollola belonged to the castle county of Häme. The administrators of Hollola, Asikkala and Tennilä were established for the administration purposes of the Finnish monarchs, after which the administrator of Uudenkylä was established. Hollola's administration was divided into the quarters of Artjärvi, Etola, Okerointe and Uskila.[citation needed] The development of Hollola's Lahti village into a township and finally into a city began when the Riihimäki–Lahti Railway and the Vesijärvi Railway Station were built on the shore of Lake Vesijärvi in the southern part of Päijänte. Lahti became the hub of Vesijärvi port's water traffic, rail traffic and road traffic. Lahti was separated from Hollola as a city on November 16, 1905. Agriculture-dominant Hollola began to industrialize in the late 1960s when the Salpakakkaa conglomeration was zoned in the village of Ala-Okeroinen along the Tampere-Lahden highway, which became Hollola's new municipal center. In recent decades, Hollola has been the fastest growing municipality in Päijät-Häme in terms of population. In Päijät-Hämee, several municipal merger discussions have been held and related investigations have been carried out. They include the Uusi Kunta project called Vellamo and the unification project of six municipalities: Hollola, Hämeenkoski, Iiti, Kärkölä, Lahti and Nastola.
