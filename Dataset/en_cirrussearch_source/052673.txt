Three competitors from Switzerland competed in two sports at the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Swiss won one championship and placed second in two more events, for a total of three medals. They had 8 entries in 5 events. The following is the list of number of competitors in the Games. All of Switzerland's medals were won by Zutter in the gymnastics competitions. Zutter's only event that did not result in a medal was in the horizontal bar. Champaud (see Bulgaria at the 1896 Summer Olympics) entered three events, but did not medal in any. Baumann took 8th of 42 in the military rifle competition. Which nation Champaud's results should be credited to is disputed. Champaud was a Swiss national living in Sofia. The Bulgarian Olympic Committee claims Champaud competed for Bulgaria, making that nation one of those debuting in 1896; however, most results list include Champaud as Swiss. The International Olympic Committee's official number of 14 nations at the 1896 Summer Olympics almost certainly includes Bulgaria, which would make Champaud's results credited to Bulgaria.
