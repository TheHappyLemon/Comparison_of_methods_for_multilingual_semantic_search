Heinrich Haussler (born 25 February 1984) is an Australian former road racing cyclist of German heritage, who competed as a professional from 2004 to April 2023. He won 2 stages in Grand Tours during his career, one at the 2005 Vuelta a España and another at the 2009 Tour de France. He was also a good Classics specialist, registering top results in notable classic races, and was the 2015 Australian national road race champion. He was the winner of the 2022 UAE Al Salam championship. Haussler was born to a German father and Australian mother and raised in the town of Inverell, New South Wales, Australia, before leaving for Germany in 1998 at age 14 to pursue a dream of being a professional cyclist. Haussler turned professional in 2005 and shot to prominence with a stage win in the 2005 Vuelta a España. Haussler took out five wins in 2006 and has had strong classics campaigns since then. He looked set to be a rider of the future in the classics, in 2009 coming in second in both the Tour of Flanders and Milan–San Remo, narrowly beaten in the latter by Mark Cavendish in a photo-finish. He also finished a strong 7th in the 2009 edition of Paris–Roubaix. Haussler's biggest victory so far was the win of Stage 13 in 2009 Tour de France. Haussler lived in Cottbus starting in 1998, and in 2009 in Freiburg im Breisgau. A dual Australian/German national, Haussler originally raced under a German license. However, in a 2008 interview on CyclingNews.com, he suggested that he would no longer race for Germany as he wished to compete for Australia in the 2010 UCI Road World Championships in Melbourne. When asked what he would do if chosen to race for Germany in the 2008 UCI Road World Championships or at the 2008 Olympics he stated, "I wouldn't take it. If you start for a country at the worlds there is a three-year ban before you can ride for another." The UCI, however, insisted that if Haussler wanted to ride for Australia he would have to give up his German citizenship, which the cyclist said in a November 2009 interview "is not open for debate at the moment". In July 2010, the Cervélo Test Team announced that Haussler would indeed give up his German citizenship and will ride for Australia in the future. However, a nagging knee injury forced Haussler out of what would have been his international cycling debut for his birth country at the 2010 World Championships. On 26 August 2010, Haussler's employer, Cervélo Test Team, confirmed rumours that it would cease to exist after the end of the current season. On 1 September 2010, it was announced he would be joining the Garmin–Cervélo for 2011. In the 2012 Tour of California, Haussler was denied victory on the four first stages of the race by Peter Sagan of the Liquigas–Cannondale squad, who beat him to the line each time. He would have to settle for second on every one of those stages. Haussler left Garmin–Sharp at the end of the 2012 season, and joined the new IAM Cycling team for the 2013 season. In 2015 he won the Australian National Road Race Championships for the first time in his career. He also began competing in cyclo-cross in 2019, and competed in the 2021 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. 2002 1st Time trial, German National Junior Road Championships 2005 1st Stage 19 Vuelta a España 3rd Overall Sachsen Tour 7th Overall Niedersachsen Rundfahrt 7th Züri-Metzgete 2006 Vuelta a Murcia 1st Points classification 1st Stages 1 & 5 Circuit Franco-Belge 1st Stages 2 & 4 1st Stage 3 Rheinland-Pfalz Rundfahrt 3rd Trofeo Mallorca 6th Clásica de Almería 2007 1st Stage 1 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré 4th Overall Niedersachsen Rundfahrt 1st Stage 5 10th Rund um den Henninger Turm 2008 1st Stage 1 Bayern Rundfahrt 9th Gent–Wevelgem 2009 1st GP Triberg-Schwarzwald Tour de France 1st Stage 13 Combativity award Stage 13 Volta ao Algarve 1st Stages 1 & 5 1st Stage 2 Paris–Nice 2nd Overall Tour of Qatar 1st Sprints classification 1st Young rider classification 2nd Milan–San Remo 2nd Tour of Flanders 2nd Neuseen Classics 3rd Grand Prix of Aargau Canton 4th Dwars door Vlaanderen 4th Sparkassen Giro Bochum 6th Overall Tour du Poitou-Charentes 1st Stage 5 6th Paris–Roubaix 8th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2010 1st Stage 2 Tour de Suisse 2nd Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 3rd Grand Prix of Aargau Canton 9th Overall Tour of Qatar 1st Sprints classification 2011 1st Stage 2 Tour of Beijing 1st Points classification Paris–Nice 2nd Overall Tour of Qatar 1st Points classification 1st Stages 2 & 3 7th E3 Prijs Vlaanderen 2012 3rd GP Ouest–France 4th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 7th Vattenfall Cyclassics 2013 1st Stage 5 Bayern Rundfahrt 4th Gent–Wevelgem 4th Paris–Bourges 6th Tour of Flanders 6th Paris–Tours 2014 1st Stage 1 Bayern Rundfahrt 3rd Grand Prix d'Isbergues 5th Paris–Tours 2015 1st Road race, Australian National Road Championships 5th Down Under Classic 7th Paris–Tours 8th Overall Tour of Qatar 9th Grand Prix of Aargau Canton 10th Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race 2016 6th Paris–Roubaix 7th Milan–San Remo 2019 10th Dwars door Vlaanderen 2020 5th Overall Saudi Tour 2021 4th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 10th Paris–Roubaix 2022 10th Classic Brugge–De Panne "Bahrain Merida Pro Cycling Team".
