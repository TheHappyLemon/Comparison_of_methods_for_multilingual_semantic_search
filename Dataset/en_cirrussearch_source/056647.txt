Warning system is any system of biological or technical nature deployed by an individual or group to inform of a future danger. Its purpose is to enable the deployer of the warning system to prepare for the danger and act accordingly to mitigate or avoid it. Warnings cannot be effective unless people react to them. People are more likely to ignore a system that regularly produces false warnings (the cry-wolf effect), but reducing the number of false warnings generally also increases the risk of not giving a warning when it is needed. Some warnings are non-specific: for instance, the probability of an earthquake of a certain magnitude in a certain area over the next decade. Such warnings cannot be used to guide short-term precautions such as evacuation. Opportunities to take long-term precautions, such as better building codes and disaster preparedness, may be ignored.[better source needed] Aposematism (e.g. warning coloration) Climate canary Fear Miner's canary Pain Emergency population warning Alberta Emergency Alert Alberta Emergency Public Warning System (replaced by Alberta Emergency Alert) Alert Ready (Canada) Automatic Warning System Child abduction alert system Dam safety system Earthquake warning system Emergency Alert System (EAS) (United States) Famine Early Warning Systems Network Federal Civil Defense Authority Fire alarm system Gale warning Ground proximity warning system Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System International Early Warning Programme J-Alert (Japan) Lane departure warning system National Severe Weather Warning Service N.E.A.R.
