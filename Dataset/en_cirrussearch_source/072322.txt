S/2003 J 9 is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003. S/2003 J 9 is about 1 kilometre in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 0.162 AU (24,200,000 km) in 767.60 days, at an inclination of 166.3° to the ecliptic (166° to Jupiter's equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.17. It belongs to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165°. This moon was once considered lost until November 2020, when the Minor Planet Center announced the recovery of S/2003 J 9 by Scott Sheppard in observations from September 2011 to April 2018.

We likely have all of the lost moons in our new observations from 2017, but to link them back to the remaining lost 2003 objects requires more observations a year later to confirm the linkages, which will not happen until early 2018. ... There are likely a few more new moons as well in our 2017 observations, but we need to reobserve them in 2018 to determine which of the discoveries are new and which are lost 2003 moons.
