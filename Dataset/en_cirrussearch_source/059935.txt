Truth or Consequences (often abbreviated as T or C /ˌtiːɔːrˈsiː/ ) is a city in the U.S. state of New Mexico, and the county seat of Sierra County. In 2020, the population was 6,052. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names for having chosen to rename itself in March 1950 after the Truth or Consequences radio show. The name is often hyphenated (Truth-or-Consequences, T-or-C) for clarity, though the formal name contains no punctuation. The area is noted for its hot springs, and the first public bath in the area was built at John Cross Ranch over Geronimo Springs in the late 19th century. The hot springs are part of the Hot Springs Artesian Basin. However, major settlement did not begin until the construction of Elephant Butte Dam and its reservoir in 1912; the dam was completed in 1916. It was a part of the Rio Grande Project, an early large-scale irrigation effort authorized under the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902. In 1916, the town was incorporated as Hot Springs. It became the Sierra County seat in 1937. By the late 1930s, Hot Springs was filled with 40 different natural-hot-spring spas – one per every 75 residents at the time – though primarily catering to visitors. The city changed its name from Hot Springs to Truth or Consequences as the result of a radio show contest. In March 1950, Ralph Edwards, the host of the popular NBC Radio quiz show Truth or Consequences, announced that he would air the program on its 10th anniversary from the first town that renamed itself after the show; Hot Springs officially changed its name on March 31, 1950, and the program was broadcast from there the following evening. Edwards visited the town during the first weekend of May for the next 50 years. This event became known as Fiesta and eventually included a beauty contest, a parade, and a stage show. The city still celebrates Fiesta each year during the first weekend of May. The parade generally features local dignitaries, last year's Miss Fiesta pageant queen, and the winner of Hatch Chile Queen pageant. Fiesta also features a dance in Ralph Edwards Park. Several hot springs are located in Truth or Consequences. The combined flow of the hot springs complex in Truth or Consequences is estimated at 99 liters (26 U.S. gal) per second. Before World War II, there were about 40 hot springs spas in Truth or Consequences. By 2008, the Hot Springs Association in Truth or Consequences had 10 spa facilities as members. Five of those obtained their water from wells, and La Paloma Hot Springs & Spa (formerly Marshall Hot Springs), Riverbend Hot Springs, Indian Springs Bath House, Artesian Bath House, and Hay-Yo-Kay Hot Springs are from free-flowing hot springs. The New Mexico Department of Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources created two demonstration projects using geothermal energy in Truth or Consequences in the 1980s. The Carrie Tingley Hospital, for children with physical disabilities, used state funding to create a physical-therapy program in Truth or Consequences, but has since moved to Albuquerque. The local Senior Citizen's Center benefits from a geothermal space heating system. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 12.8 square miles (33 km2), of which 12.6 square miles (33 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (0.86%) is water. The city is located on the Rio Grande, near Elephant Butte Reservoir. The city is served by the Truth or Consequences Municipal Airport, Interstate 25, I-25 Business, New Mexico State Road 51 (NM 51), NM 181 and NM 187. Truth or Consequences has a cool desert climate (Köppen BWk) with three main seasons. The summer season from April to June is very dry and generally hot with large diurnal temperature variation, giving way in July to the monsoon season which remains very hot – and is more uncomfortable due to the hotter nights – but is much more humid as rainfall from thunderstorms is frequent. The winter season from October to March has pleasantly mild and sunny days and cold to very cold nights, with very occasional rainfall from extratropical cyclones. On average over the year, 88.6 days top 90 °F (32.2 °C), 20.3 days top 100 °F or 37.8 °C, and 68.8 nights fall below 32 °F or 0 °C. The record low is −7 °F (−21.7 °C) on January 11, 1962. The lowest maximum temperature on record has been 15 °F (−9.4 °C) on January 1948, but during most years every single day will top freezing and on average only 20.2 days fail to top 50 °F (10 °C). The hottest temperature on record is 111 °F (43.9 °C) on June 26–27, 1994, though minimums virtually never stay above 75 °F (23.9 °C) due to the low humidity and hot sun. Precipitation is generally scarce apart from monsoonal storms. The wettest month on record has been July 2008 with 6.38 inches (162.1 mm), but totals above 4.00 inches (101.6 mm) are confined to the monsoon season apart from an anomaly in December 1991 when three major subtropical cyclones brought 4.70 inches (119.4 mm). Also, 1991 was the wettest full calendar year with 16.70 inches (424.2 mm).
