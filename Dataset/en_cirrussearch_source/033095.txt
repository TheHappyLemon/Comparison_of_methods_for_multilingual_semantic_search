Therese Charlotte Luise of Saxony-Hildburghausen (8 July 1792 – 26 October 1854) was queen of Bavaria as the wife of King Ludwig I. Oktoberfest was created in honour of their wedding and is still celebrated annually on Theresienwiese in Munich. Therese was popular amongst the people of Bavaria, and was heavily involved in her husband's politics, as well as her own charity work. Therese was a daughter of Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, and Duchess Charlotte Georgine of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, eldest daughter of Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In 1809, she was on the list of possible brides for Napoleon, but on 12 October 1810 married the Bavarian crown prince Ludwig. Their wedding was the occasion of the first ever Oktoberfest. She became queen in 1825. During the numerous love affairs of her husband, Therese suffered but tolerated the situation. She did not refrain, however, from demonstrating her disapproval in discreet ways; in 1831, she left town during one of his affairs, and she strictly rejected associating with the mistresses. Therese often assisted with the administration of the kingdom of Bavaria, especially when Ludwig was absent from Munich during his numerous journeys, and she did have some political influence and participated in political issues. She was very popular and was considered to embody an ideal image of queen, wife and mother. She was involved in a great number of charitable organizations for widows, orphans and the poor. She was the object of great sympathy during her husband's infidelity with Lola Montez, which was one of many factors that contributed to his unpopularity and his abdication in 1848. On the evening of October 12, 1810, Therese and Ludwig married in the court chapel of Munich, which marked the first royal wedding in Munich since 1722. The kingdom of Bavaria was only 4 years old at that time, and showcased its splendor during a 5 day wedding celebration. The festivities began on Max-Joseph-Platz the following day. The city was illuminated and included a folk festival, a free opera, a play, a ball and a music academy. On the last day of celebrations on October 17, The National Guard Cavalry organized a large horse race on the square in front of the Sendlinger Tor. The newlywed couple was greeted by nine farm couples of the new administrative districts of the Bavarian Kingdom dressed in traditional garb. Therese wore a dress made with the Bavarian national colours and the area was then named Theresienwiese in honour of the crown princess. Due to her popularity amongst the people, the celebrations were repeated the following year and evolved to become the still celebrated Oktoberfest. Sachsen-Hildburhausen had a heavy burden to bear because of the costs of the royal wedding and dowry of the bride. On June 26, 1811, Therese's father, Duke Friedrich, noted that he was unable to pay for the wedding from the current budget. During her husband's reign as king of Bavaria, Therese showed interest in state affairs and was considered a political companion to her husband. Whenever Ludwig was away from Munich, she would inform him about court and country events. In March of 1830, she collected newspaper articles from both the French Journal de Débats and various German newspapers in order to bring Ludwig's attention to the emerging July Revolution. She believed that the king should know everything that was going on in his country. She also kept their son Otto, who was in Greece, informed about political events going on back home. When Otto was elected King of Greece in 1832, she urged her husband to consult and listen to Otto on the matter. Further, she warned Ludwig I about the scholar Friedrich Thiersch whom she considered too liberal, and the painter Karl Wilhelm von Heydeck, whom she considered unpopular in Greece. There are many political letters written from the Queen to Ludwig I stored in the house archives of the Wittelbachs, the content of which has yet to be evaluated. On the anniversary of the Battle of the Leipzig in 1814, Therese von Saxen-Hildburghausen organized a feeding for the poor and thereby became a patron of the Salzburg Women's Association. In 1827, Therese founded Theresienorden, a distinguished order for women of Bavaria, whose aim was to provide for the poor . She was also heavily involved in the Women's Association for Day Nurseries and was quite close with one of the founders, Auguste Escherisch. She described her as a simple woman of the people.Therese had to obtain the Kings permission to interact with her, and during a visit to Auguste Escherisch's house, the Queen confessed to having never seen a kitchen before and was consequently instructed on how to use pots and pans. Therese and Ludwig had nine children: Maximilian (1811–1864), who married Princess Marie of Prussia (1825–1889); King of Bavaria as Maximilian II from 1848 to 1864.
