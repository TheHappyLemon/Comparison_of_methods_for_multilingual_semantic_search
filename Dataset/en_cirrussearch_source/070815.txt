S/2021 J 5 is a small outer natural satellite of Jupiter discovered by Scott S. Sheppard, David J. Tholen, and Chad Trujillo on 5 September 2021, using the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory, Hawaii. It was announced by the Minor Planet Center on 19 January 2023, after observations were collected over a long enough time span to confirm the satellite's orbit. S/2021 J 5 is part of the Carme group, a tight cluster of retrograde irregular moons of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Carme at semi-major axes between 22–24 million km (14–15 million mi), orbital eccentricities between 0.2–0.3, and inclinations between 163–166°. It has a diameter of about 2 km (1.2 mi) for an absolute magnitude of 16.8. "MPEC 2023-B41 : S/2021 J 5". Minor Planet Electronic Circulars. Minor Planet Center. 19 January 2023.
