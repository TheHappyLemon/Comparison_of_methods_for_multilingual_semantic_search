The David Glacier (75°19′S 162°00′E﻿ / ﻿75.317°S 162.000°E﻿ / -75.317; 162.000) is a glacier over 60 nautical miles (110 km; 69 mi) long, flowing east from the polar plateau through the Prince Albert Mountains to the coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica. It enters Ross Sea between Cape Philippi and Cape Reynolds to form the floating Drygalski Ice Tongue. It is the most imposing outlet glacier in Victoria Land. It is fed by two main flows which drain an area larger than 200,000 square kilometres, with an estimated ice discharge rate of 7.8 +/- 0.7 km³/year. The David Glacier was discovered by Ernest Shackleton's "Northern Party," in November 1908, under the leadership of Prof. T.W. Edgeworth David, of Sydney University, for whom the feature was named. The David Glacier flows eastward in a broad stream that gradually narrows towards the coast. The northern flow drains from Talos Dome to the Ross Sea, but the main branch of the stream is fed by a network of tributaries which drain a common area of the inner plateau around Dome C and converge in a spectacular icefall known as the David Cauldron. Mount Kring, Mount Wood and the Martin Nunataks are to the north of the David Glacier's head. The Ricker Hills and Trio Nunataks are to the south. The Hollingsworth Glacier joins the David Glacier from the southeast to the east of the Trio Nunataks. East of this the glacier descends through the David Cauldron, then continues east. It is joined from the north by the Woodberry Glacier, flowing between Evans Heights and Mount Fearon, and past Mount Priestley to the east. In its lower section the David Glacier flows past the D'Urville Wall, Mount Neumayer and Cape Philippi to the north, in the Prince Albert Mountains, and past Hughes Bluff and Cape Reynolds to the south, to form the Drygalski Ice Tongue, which enters the Ross Sea between Relief Inlet to the north and Geikie Inlet to the south. Features of the glacier, its tributaries and the terrain through which they flow include: 74°59′S 157°54′E﻿ / ﻿74.983°S 157.900°E﻿ / -74.983; 157.900. A sharply defined nunatak on the northern margin of the upper reaches of David Glacier, 13 nautical miles (24 km; 15 mi) southwest of Mount Wood.

Rainey of the Cartographic Branch of the New Zealand Dept. of Lands and Survey for Staff Sergeant Arthur L.

Martin, USGS topographic engineer at McMurdo Station, 1961–62. 75°33′S 159°57′E﻿ / ﻿75.550°S 159.950°E﻿ / -75.550; 159.950. A broad glacier of low gradient, draining the vicinity east of the Ricker Hills and flowing northeast to enter David Glacier just east of Trio Nunataks. Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1956–62. Named by US-ACAN for Jerry L. Hollingsworth, meteorologist with the South Pole Station winter party, 1966. 75°20′S 160°50′E﻿ / ﻿75.333°S 160.833°E﻿ / -75.333; 160.833. An icefall of turbulent iceblocks on the David Glacier. Named by the Southern Party of the NZGSAE, 1962–63, in association with David Glacier. 75°06′S 161°38′E﻿ / ﻿75.100°S 161.633°E﻿ / -75.100; 161.633. A small tributary glacier flowing south between Evans Heights and Mount Fearon to the north side of David Glacier. Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1956–62. Named by US-ACAN for Barry D. Woodberry, ionospheric physicist with the South Pole Station winter party, 1966. 75°16′S 162°13′E﻿ / ﻿75.267°S 162.217°E﻿ / -75.267; 162.217. A great glacier-cut wall of granite which rises to 720 metres (2,360 ft) high and forms the north wall of David Glacier near its terminus. Discovered by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09, under Shackleton. He named this feature for Admiral Jules Dumont d'Urville. 75°14′S 162°33′E﻿ / ﻿75.233°S 162.550°E﻿ / -75.233; 162.550.
