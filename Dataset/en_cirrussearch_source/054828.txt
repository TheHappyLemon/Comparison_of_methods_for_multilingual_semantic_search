Alessandro Bastoni Cavaliere OMRI (born 13 April 1999) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Serie A club Inter Milan and the Italy national team. Considered one of the best centre-backs in the world, he is known for his well-timed tackles and ball playing ability. Bastoni was born in Casalmaggiore, Lombardy, and began his career in the local Rivarolo Mantovano youth side, where his father was coach. At the age of 7, he joined the youth side of Serie A club Atalanta. Bastoni progressed through various age groups at Bergamo, including making nearly 30 appearances for the under-17 side, before eventually progressing to the Primavera side, where he established himself as a regular starter at the centre of defence. He was named on the first-team bench for the first time on 30 October 2016, for the game against Genoa, and made his full debut a month later in the Coppa Italia game against Pescara, playing the full game in a 3–0 victory. In Serie A, Bastoni remained as an unused substitute for the six games after Genoa until making his debut in a 1–0 win over Sampdoria on 22 January 2017, playing full 90 minutes. On 31 August 2017, Inter Milan announced the signing of Bastoni for €31 million, and on the same day, his loan at Atalanta for the next two seasons. Inter officially recalled defender Alessandro Bastoni early from his loan with Atalanta and renewed his contract until 2023 on 14 July 2018. On 7 August 2018, Bastoni joined Parma on loan until 30 June 2019. He made his debut on 7 October 2018, in the league match won 3–1 away against Genoa. Bastoni has been capped by Italy at every level from U15 to U19. His first international goal came in a 4–0 win over Norway whilst playing for the under-16 team. He was first called up to the under-18 side by coach Paolo Nicolato in August 2016, and was made captain in his second game; a 2–2 draw with the Netherlands. He was called up to the Italy under-19 side by coach Paolo Nicolato on 9 August 2017 at the age of 18. He made his debut with the Italy U21 team on 11 October 2018, in a friendly match lost 1–0 against Belgium. He became immediately a starter and he took part in the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship on home soil. Bastoni received his first call up to the senior Italy squad from manager Roberto Mancini, for the UEFA Nations League matches against Bosnia Herzegovina and Netherlands in September 2020. He made his senior debut for Italy on 11 November, starting in a 4–0 friendly win against Estonia in Florence. In June 2021, Bastoni was included in Italy's squad for UEFA Euro 2020. He made his first and only appearance of the tournament in Italy's final group match, starting in a 1–0 victory against Wales in Rome on 20 June; the result allowed them to top their group. On 11 July, Bastoni won the European Championship with Italy following a 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory over England at Wembley Stadium in the final, after a 1–1 draw in extra-time. On 14 June 2022, in Italy's fourth group match of the UEFA Nations League, Bastoni scored his first international goal in a 5–2 away loss to Germany. A left–footed defender, Bastoni started his career as a full-back, but is also capable of playing as a centre-back, a role in which he became increasingly deployed as his career progressed. He is mainly known for his passing ability and ball control, while his height and ability to exploit spaces allows him to be effective in the air, which makes him a goal threat from indirect set–pieces. Regarded as a promising young player in the media, in 2020, he was included in the list of "Fifty for the future: UEFA.com's ones to watch." Bastoni's father, Nicola, was also a footballer, who played as a left–back for Cremonese. On 21 January 2022 his long-time partner gave birth to a daughter, who was named Azzurra.
