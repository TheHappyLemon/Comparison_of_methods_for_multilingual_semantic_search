Hiroshi Amano (天野 浩, Amano Hiroshi, born September 11, 1960) is a Japanese physicist, engineer and inventor specializing in the field of semiconductor technology. For his work he was awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Isamu Akasaki and Shuji Nakamura for "the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources". Amano was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2016 for the development of p-type gallium nitride (GaN) doping, enabling blue semiconductor LEDs. Amano was born in Hamamatsu, Japan, on September 11, 1960. He received his BE, ME and DE degree in 1983, 1985 and 1989, respectively, from Nagoya University. During elementary school days, he played soccer as a goalkeeper and softball as a catcher. He was also passionate about amateur radio and despite hating studying, he was good at mathematics. Upon entering high school, he began taking his studies seriously and became a top student by studying every day late into the night. From 1988 to 1992, he was a research associate at Nagoya University. In 1992, he moved to Meijo University, where he was an assistant professor. From 1998 to 2002, He was an associate professor. In 2002, he became a professor. In 2010, he moved to the Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, where he is currently a professor. He joined Professor Isamu Akasaki's group in 1982 as an undergraduate student. Since then, he has been doing research on the growth, characterization and device applications of group III nitride semiconductors, which are well known as materials used in blue light-emitting diodes today. In 1985, he developed low-temperature deposited buffer layers for the growth of group III nitride semiconductor films on a sapphire substrate, which led to the realization of group-III-nitride semiconductor based light-emitting diodes and laser diodes. In 1989, he succeeded in growing p-type GaN and fabricating a p-n-junction-type GaN-based UV/blue light-emitting diode for the first time in the world. Known to be keen on research, Amano's laboratory was always lit late at night, such as weekdays, holidays, New Year's Day, and was called "no night castle". According to his students in the laboratory, Amano has an optimistic and temperate personality, and is never angry. 1994 – Fifth Optoelectronics Conference A Special Award 1996 – IEEE/LEOS Engineering Achievement Award 1998 – Japanese Journal of Applied Physics Award for the best review paper 1998 – British Rank Prize 2001 – Marubun Academic Award 2002 – Takeda Award 2003 – SSDM Award 2004 – TITech精密工学研究所第1回P＆Iパテント・オブ・ザ・イヤー 2008 – 日本結晶成長学会論文賞 2014 – APEX/JJAP Editorial Contribution Award der Japan Society of Applied Physics 2014 – Nobel Prize in Physics 2015 – Chu-Nichi Culture Award 2015 – Special Achievement Award, Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers 2015 – Prizes for Science and Technology (Research Category) by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology 2015 – 産学官連携功労者表彰日本学術会議会長賞 2015 – Asia Game Changer Award 2009 – Fellow, Japan Society of Applied Physics 2009 – Nistep (National Institute of Science and Technology Policy) Researcher from the Ministry of Education of Japan 2011 – Fellow, Institute of Physics 2014 – Person of Cultural Merit, the Japanese Government 2014 – Order of Culture, the Japanese Emperor 2015 – Honorary citizenship of Shizuoka prefecture 2015 – Honorary citizenship of Hamamatsu City 2015 – Aichi Prefecture Academic Honors 2015 – Nagoya City Academic Honors 2015 – Honorary Fellow, Japan Sweden Society 2015 – Honorary citizenship of Aichi prefecture 2015 – 丸八会顕彰 2016 – Foreign Member of the National Academy of Engineering 2019 - Foreign members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering 2022 - Members of the Japan Academy Amano's wife is a Japanese lecturer at Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia.
