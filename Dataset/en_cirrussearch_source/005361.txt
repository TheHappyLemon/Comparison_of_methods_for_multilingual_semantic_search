The Orvin Mountains (Norwegian: Orvinfjella) constitute a major group of mountain ranges, extending for about 100 km (62 mi) between the Wohlthat Mountains and the Mühlig-Hofmann Mountains in Queen Maud Land. With its summit at 3,055 metres (10,023 ft), the massive Sandeggtind Peak forms the highest point in the Conrad Mountains, a subrange of the Orvin Mountains. First photographed from the air and roughly plotted by the Third German Antarctic Expedition (1938-1939), led by Capt. Alfred Ritscher. Mapped by Norwegian cartographers from surveys and air photos by the Sixth Norwegian Antarctic Expedition (1956–60) and named for Anders K. Orvin, director of the Norwegian Polar Institute from 1958 to 1959.
