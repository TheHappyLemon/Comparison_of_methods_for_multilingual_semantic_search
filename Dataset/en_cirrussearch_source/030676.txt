The Baltic Defense (also known as the Grau Defense, or the Sahovic Defense) is a chess opening characterized by the moves: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 Bf5!? The Baltic is an unusual variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD). In most defenses to the QGD, Black has difficulties developing her queen bishop. This opening takes a radical approach to the problem by bringing out the queen bishop immediately. The Baltic has not found widespread acceptance among chess masters, but some world-class players have used it including grandmasters Paul Keres and Alexei Shirov. The ECO code for the Baltic Defense is D06. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves. White has several replies to this opening, including 3.Nf3, 3.cxd5, 3.Qb3, and 3.Nc3.
