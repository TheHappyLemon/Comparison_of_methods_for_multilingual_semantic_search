Initially responding to reports of a house fire at Kellner's address in Hurstville at around 4am on 20 December, firefighters found the decomposing body of Kellner's husband John Kellner in a bedroom. Narelle Kellner was found still alive but with a self-inflicted bullet wound to her forehead in the loungeroom. Kellner died from her injuries on the way to hospital. It was believed she had deliberately set fire to the house. Police said they believed Kellner had murdered her seriously unwell husband about a week earlier and had been living in the house with his dead body. They indicated that they would be treating the deaths as a murder-suicide. Neighbours described the couple as reclusive. The president of the New South Wales Chess Association described the couple as an "odd pair who were suited to each other" and suggested the game of chess had become an obsession. Australian chess champion Ian Rogers claimed that John Kellner had previously suggested there had been conspiracies against him, which did not exist. On 24 December 1987, a statement was issued by the Australian Chess Federation in which they said they wished to record their deep regret at the deaths of both John Kellner and Narelle Kellner before detailing their respective achievements. Kellner was cremated at the Rookwood Crematorium on 5 January 1988. "1976 Tbilisi Interzonal Tournament : World Chess Championship (women)". www.mark-weeks.com.
