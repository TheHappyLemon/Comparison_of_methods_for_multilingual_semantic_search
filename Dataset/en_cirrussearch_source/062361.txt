Pro-Europeanism, sometimes called European Unionism, is a political position that favours European integration and membership of the European Union (EU). Pro-Europeans are mostly classified as "centrist" (Renew Europe) in the context of European politics, including "centre-right" liberal conservatives (ex. EPP Group) and "centre-left" social democrats (ex. S&D and Greens/EFA). Pro-Europeanism is ideologically closely related to the European and Global liberal movement.
