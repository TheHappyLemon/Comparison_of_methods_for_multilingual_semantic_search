The National Olympic Committee of Albania (KOKSH) was founded in 1958 and a year later gained recognition by the International Olympic Committee. From the year of its foundation until 1989 the committee was known by the name "The General Council Committee of Sportspersons of Albania" and included in its core all the sports federations in the country. With the change of the political system in Albania, in 1990, the committee was restructured as an independent entity, separate from the newly formed Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports. Four years later, in 1994, by government decrees No.20 and No.401, it was sanctioned as a non-state non-profit organisation whose functions were based on the Olympic Charter.
