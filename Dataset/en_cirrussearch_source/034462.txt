Peitz (German: [paɪ̯t͡s] ; Lower Sorbian Picnjo) is a town in the district of Spree-Neiße, in Lower Lusatia, Brandenburg, Germany. It is situated 13 km northeast of Cottbus. Surrounded by freshwater lakes, it is well known for its fishing industry. The town was at one time on the border between the states of Brandenburg and Saxony, and was formerly protected by strong artillery fortifications built in brick, dating from the 16th century. Only small parts of these remain. From 1815 to 1947, Peitz was part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. After World War II, Peitz was incorporated into the State of Brandenburg from 1947 to 1952 and the Bezirk Cottbus of East Germany from 1952 to 1990. Since 1990, Peitz has been part of Brandenburg.
