Danske Bank A/S (pronounced [ˈtænˀskə ˈpɑŋˀk], lit. 'danish bank') is a Danish multinational banking and financial services corporation. Headquartered in Copenhagen, it is the largest bank in Denmark and a major retail bank in the northern European region with over 5 million retail customers. Danske Bank was number 454 on the Fortune Global 500 list for 2011. The largest shareholder with 21% of the share capital is A.P. Moller Holding, the investment holding company of the Maersk family. It was founded 5 October 1871 as Den Danske Landmandsbank, Hypothek- og Vexelbank i Kjøbenhavn ("The Danish Farmers' Bank, Mortgage and Exchange Bank of Copenhagen"), and was commonly known as Landmandsbanken ("the Farmers' Bank"). In 1976, the bank changed name to Den Danske Bank ("The Danish Bank"), and the current name was adopted in 2000. Danske Bank group operates a number of local banks around the Nordic region (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland) as well as across Ireland. In Denmark, the major expansion occurred in 1990 after the merger with Kjøbenhavns Handelsbank and Provinsbanken. Most of the international operations were established by a series of acquisitions: of Östgöta Enskilda Bank in Sweden in 1997, of Fokus Bank in Norway in 1999, of Northern Bank in Ireland in 2004, and of Sampo Bank in Finland, the Baltic countries, and Russia in 2007. In February 2019, following the money laundering scandal at its Estonian branch, Danske Bank announced that it will cease all its banking activities in the Baltic countries and Russia. Between 2007–2012, Sampo Bank was responsible for Danske Bank's operations in Finland after Danske Bank acquired Sampo Group's banking business while it retained its insurance business. Sampo Bank traced its origins back to 1887, to Postisäästöpankki (translated Postal Savings Bank), a bank associated with the national post office, which accepted deposits from the public at post offices. In 1970, the company was renamed Postipankki (Post Bank). In 1988, the bank became a full-service bank. It was organized as a state-owned limited company. In 1997, the company merged with Suomen Vientiluotto (Finnish Export Credit) to form Leonia Pankki. Leonia Pankki was merged with Sampo Group in 2000, and in 2001 was renamed Sampo Pankki. At the same year, Mandatum Bank merged with Sampo Group. Mandatum was created in 1998 by a merger of Interbank Osakepankki, established in 1988, and Mandatum & Co., established in 1992. On 15 November 2012, Sampo Bank was renamed Danske Bank after banking operations were uniformed under one brand. The purchase of Sampo Pankki by Danske Bank with just over €4 billion was the largest purchase in cash to date in Finland. Danske Bank has set up its own captive technology centre in India, Bangalore called Danske IT Services India Pvt Ltd. Danske Bank's Irish subsidiary was formerly known as the National Irish Bank, and was originally the Republic of Ireland branch network of Northern Bank, one of the oldest banks in Ireland (dating back to 1824). National Irish Bank was created as a separate entity in 1986, at first under the name Northern Bank (Ireland) Limited, when its then owners, UK-based Midland Bank, separated Northern Bank's operations in the Republic of Ireland from its Northern Ireland business. In 1987, both banks were acquired by National Australia Bank (along with Midland Bank's Scottish subsidiary, Clydesdale Bank). In 1988 the Republic of Ireland operation was renamed National Irish Bank Limited whilst Northern Bank Limited remained the name of the Northern Ireland operation. Nonetheless, a single management team continued to run both banks, which shared many services and back office functions. During this era, the logo of the National Irish Bank was that of the National Australia Bank (at the time), except that the red star had been recoloured green, and "Irish Bank" was added alongside the word "National". The original Northern Bank logo had been the Midland Bank griffin.[citation needed] On 10 May 2012, Danske Bank announced that Northern Bank and National Irish Bank would be merged on 1 June 2012, under the Northern Bank management team and the Danske Bank name, effectively reversing the separation between the two. The rebrand was completed on 18 November 2012. At the time the bank closed its 27 branches to focus on corporate and private clients. On 31 October 2013 Danske Bank announced it would be withdrawing all personal banking services in the Republic of Ireland on a phased basis in the first half of 2014.

It became a public company in 1824 taking the name Northern Banking Company Limited. It became Northern Bank in 1970, after merging with the Belfast Banking Company. Northern Bank was one of the Big Four banks in Northern Ireland. Danske Bank bought the bank from National Australia Bank in December 2004, and Northern Bank continued to operate under its own name until it took on the name of its parent company as its trading name in November 2012. The bank is considered one of the leading retail banks in Northern Ireland with 44 branches and three business centres.

In 2014, The Estonian Financial Supervision Authority found "large-scale, long-lasting systemic violations of anti-money laundering rules" in the Estonian branch of Danske Bank and notified the Danish authorities on the findings. According to the Estonian Financial Supervision Authority, the activities decreased after they requested the bank to target the violations. In October 2017, Danske Bank confirmed that French authorities were investigating the bank's involvement in money laundering. On 31 July 2018, Estonia's prosecutor general, Lavly Perling, opened a criminal investigation following allegations that the bank had facilitated large-scale money laundering through its Estonian branch. On 19 September 2018, Danske Bank confirmed that Thomas Borgen, CEO of the bank, would resign due to the money laundering scandal. In September, Denmark's Financial Supervisory Authority reopened its investigation of the bank, and the United Kingdom's National Crime Agency announced that it was investigating the use of UK-registered companies. In October, the bank confirmed that the United States Department of Justice had also launched a criminal investigation. In November, Danish prosecutors filed four preliminary charges against the bank. In February 2019, the Estonian Financial Supervisory Authority ordered the bank to cease its operations in the country within 8 months.

Danish prosecutors filed four preliminary charges in November 2018. As a consequence of the money laundering scandal Danske Bank was named as 2018's most corrupted actor by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. A Danish woman was remanded in custody in relation to the scandal in December 2021. In December 2022, Danske Bank pled guilty and agreed to a $2 billion fine in a case from the United States Department of Justice. On 30 August 2020, TV 2 and Berlingske released a report detailing how Danske Bank lost track of over 100,000 customers' accounts, which resulted in customers overpaying their debts. The issue was caused by a 2004 IT system migration, as well as several other database and accounting errors that have existed since 1979. Danske Bank issued an apology, calling the case "deeply regrettable," and offered compensation for account holders that the bank confirmed were affected by the issue. In a press release, the bank estimated that the total compensation for customers would be 80-100 million DKK (approximately US$13–16 million). The incident also raised questions on if the bank misled the Financial Supervisory Authority, which may result in fines or disciplinary actions. The Danske Bank share price dropped more than 70% following the disclosure of the Estonian money laundering scandal and the company was subsequently targeted by activist shareholders. Michael Strabo of Strabo Investments Limited publicly argued the Board of Directors should consider selling the company and implement a share buyback program in order to create shareholder value. On the 2 of February, 2024 Danske Bank announced a share buyback worth DKK 5.5 billion, representing 60bp of CET1 and management expressed the intention to increase the size of the buyback going forward.
