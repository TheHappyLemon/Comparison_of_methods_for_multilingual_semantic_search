The Argentina–Brazil football rivalry is a sports rivalry between the national football teams of the two countries and their respective sets of fans. Games between the two teams are often marked by notable and controversial incidents. The rivalry has also been referred to as the Battle of the Americas or the Superclassic of the Americas (Spanish: Superclásico de las Américas; Portuguese: Superclássico das Américas). FIFA has described it as the "essence of football rivalry". CNN ranked it second on their top 10 list of international football rivalries—only below the older England–Scotland football rivalry. Brazil-Argentina matches are often known for the high level of competitiveness and talent between the two teams. Brazil and Argentina have the highest average football Elo Rating calculated over the entire team history. Both are also routinely ranked among the top ten national teams in the world in both the FIFA World Rankings and the World Football Elo Ratings, and have produced players considered at the time the best in the world, such as Alfredo Di Stéfano, Diego Maradona, and Lionel Messi for Argentina and Pelé, Ronaldo, and Ronaldinho from Brazil. The origins of the football rivalry between Argentina and Brazil can be traced to a time before football became popular in both countries. Their rivalry is found in almost all sports, but a men's football match between Argentina and Brazil is particularly important. No matches were held between 1925 and 1937 after a violent Copa América final as both teams declined to compete in competitions in which the other was competing. After another violent encounter in 1946, the two teams did not play against each other for ten years. In another controversial game at the 1990 World Cup, Brazilian Branco accused an Argentina coach of lacing his water bottle with tranquilizers. Maradona would later describe it as "Holy Water". Since their first match in 1914, the men's national teams have played 107 matches including friendlies, FIFA World Cup matches, and other official competitions (excluding matches between youth sides). Although the number of matches figures is disputed as some matches in early years are not universally accepted due to debates over the establishment of the true Brazil team. Argentina dominated the early years with more than double the Brazilian victories, despite Brazil winning World Cups in 1958 and 1962. However, the 1970s proved to be dark times for Argentina, with seven defeats, four draws, and only one victory. Argentina did win the 1978 World Cup, drawing with Brazil along the way. The highest scoring wins between these two nations were for Argentina 6–1 (at home in Buenos Aires, 1940) and 1–5 (away at Rio de Janeiro, 1939), for Brazil 6–2 (at home in Rio de Janeiro, 1945) and 1–4 (away at Buenos Aires, 1960). The most important victory matches between these two nations were, for Argentina, the 2–0 match in the 1937 Copa América final, the 0–0 draw in the 1978 World Cup that helped Argentina reach the final and their first World Cup title, the 1–0 victory over Brazil in the 1990 World Cup which eliminated Brazil from the World Cup in the round of 16, and the 1–0 victory over Brazil in the 2021 Copa América final, played in the Maracanã Stadium. For Brazil, the most important victories were wins in two Copa América finals. The first, held in Peru in 2004, saw Brazil win 4–2 via a penalty shoot-out after the match had ended in 2–2 draw, and the second was a 3–0 win in the 2007 final played in Venezuela. Another notable victory for Brazil was the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup final, where they defeated Argentina 4–1 in the decisive match.

List of matches played from 1908 to 1914 – before the CBF was established – between the Argentina national team and diverse representatives (named themselves "Brazil"), such as Liga Paulista and Liga Carioca combined, or clubs (Paulistano, SC Americano), among others. It is believed that in the first match held on 2 July 1908, Argentina wore the light blue and white shirt for the first time, although other sources state that the shirt debuted in a Copa Newton match v Uruguay in September that year. In 1913, a Liga Paulista team arrived in Argentina to play two friendly matches there. 1976 Taça do Atlântico matches also counted for the 1976 Roca Cup Organised by the Porto Alegre newspaper Zero Hora to celebrate its 35th. anniversary. Organised by the Argentine Football Association to celebrate its 100th. anniversary. Not to be confused with the homonymous Argentine national cup. Organised by Argentine newspaper Clarín to celebrate its 50th. anniversary. This match was not of Brazil national team, but Rio de Janeiro state football team Among the elite group of players, football fans consider as contenders for the title, of the best player of all time, Brazil's Pelé and Argentina's Diego Maradona are amongst the most famous. Some of their countrymen also feature regularly in such debates. The next most notable pair are perhaps Garrincha (Brazil) Lionel Messi (Argentina) and Alfredo Di Stéfano (Argentina). The most dominant figures from the two countries in the modern game are Neymar (Brazilian) and Messi, who both played for Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. Both Pelé and Maradona have declared Neymar and Messi their respective "successors". However, the overriding discussion about which of Pelé and Maradona is the greater has proved to be never-ending. Many consider the comparison between them useless, as they played during incomparable eras and in different leagues. The debate between the pair has been described as "the rivalry of their countries in microcosm". Pelé was given the title "Athlete of the Century" by the International Olympic Committee. In 1999, Time magazine named Pelé one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century. Also, he was elected Football Player of the Century, by France Football's Golden Ball Winners in 1999, Football Player of the Century, and South America Football Player of the Century, both by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), 1999. For his part, Maradona has been named Best Player of the 20th Century by the Globe Soccer Awards, the best soccer player in World Cup history both by The Times and FourFourTwo regarded him as the "Best Football Player of All Time". He was also elected as the "Greatest Athlete in History" by Corriere Dello Sport – Stadio. The controversy reached a climax during the FIFA Player of the Century in 2000, in which Maradona was voted Player of the Century in an official internet poll, garnering 53.6% of the votes against 18.53% for Pelé. Shortly before the ceremony, FIFA decided to add a second award and appointed a "Football Family" committee composed of football journalists that gave Pelé the title of The Best Player of the Century to make it a draw. This move was criticized in Argentina, that suspected Pelé was rewarded for his constant support of FIFA, in contrast to Maradona's frequent criticism. Others believe that FIFA was considering issues other than football, notably Maradona's drug problem. Maradona left the ceremony right after receiving his award and before Pelé was given his. In another internet poll that took place in 2002, Maradona received another award from FIFA, as one of his goals was selected as the World Cup Goal of the Century. One of Pelé's goals received third place, while Maradona had a second goal selected as fourth. Despite their frequent confrontations, usually through quotations by the media, Pelé was the guest star of Maradona's TV show La Noche del 10 ("The Night of the #10"), where they had a friendly chat and played a bout of headers. The two players also showed great respect for each other despite differences, such as when Pelé stated in 2018 that Maradona was better than Messi, or in 2019 when Maradona prayed for Pelé to recover after the Brazilian legend was admitted to hospital for health reasons. When Maradona died on 25 November 2020, Pelé was among the major football figures to mourn Maradona's death. For the 1925 Copa América, Argentina and Brazil played the final match at Sportivo Barracas Stadium, on Christmas Day, drawing a crowd of more than 30,000 people. After 27 minutes Lagarto intercepted a back pass by Ludovico Bidoglio and passed the ball to Arthur Friedenreich, who beat Américo Tesoriere with a strong shot, making it 1-0 to Brazil. Three minutes later, Nilo scored the second for the canarinha. The crowd was astonished, because if the Brazilian lead was maintained, a new match would have to be played to determine the champion. Before completing the first half, a dangerous counterattack by the visitors was stopped by Ramón Muttis with a strong foul on Friedenreich, who in turn, reacted with a kick. The Argentine responded with a punch in the Brazilian's face, and the incident sparked a clash involving several players and some spectators invaded the pitch. The game was suspended and only resumed - without a sending-off - after a hug between Friedenreich and Muttis that sealed a truce. However, the match had changed course, at the end of the first half Antonio Cerrotti reduced the deficit and opened the road to recovery. The equaliser came ten minutes into the second half through Manuel Seoane. The match ended 2–2, and Argentina won its second Copa America. The incidents did not go unnoticed in Brazil and some local newspapers referred to the game as "The Barracas' War". Because of this match, Argentina and Brazil did not play officially again for 11 years. In the 1937 South American Championship (currently Copa América), the rivalry between both teams was already something of national pride. There were verbal confrontations between both parties, and Argentine fans often taunted the Brazilians by calling them macaquitos and making monkey sounds. The final match, held in Buenos Aires, was played between the two sides and was goalless after 90 minutes. In extra time, Argentina scored two goals. Questioning one of the goals and fearful for their own safety, the Brazilian players decided to leave the stadium before the match was officially finished. The Brazilian press has since called this match "jogo da vergonha" ("the shame game"). Argentina won, 2–0, and was South American champion again. The 1939 edition of the Roca Cup was the longest in history, having been defined after four matches. The first two games were held in Estádio São Januário in Rio de Janeiro. The first one, held in January, ended 5–1 to Argentina. A second match was held only one week later, with the Brazilian team seeking revenge for the previous defeat. The match was vibrating; first Brazil went ahead 1–0, then Argentina recovered to lead 1–2, and Brazil then drew level at 2–2. Shortly before the end of the match, the referee, the same as in the previous match, gave a penalty to Brazil. Furious, Argentina player Arcadio López verbally attacked the referee and had to be escorted out of the pitch by police. The Argentine team, enraged by the actions of the referee and the police, left the pitch. The penalty that gave Brazil the 3–2 victory was scored without a goalkeeper, because the entire Argentine team had already walked off the pitch. As both teams had won one match each, a third game was scheduled to be played at Parque Antarctica in São Paulo. The match ended 2–2 after extra time therefore a fourth and final match was held in the same venue and was won by Argentina 3–0, which finally won the trophy. In the 1945 Copa Roca match that Brazil won 6–2, young Brazilian Ademir de Menezes fractured Argentine José Battagliero's leg. Though it seemed to be only an unfortunate accident, the game was played roughly and sometimes violent. A few months later, the 1946 South American Championship final again involved Argentina and Brazil. There was widespread media coverage, and the conviction that it would be a rough match. Twenty-eight minutes after the beginning, when both teams went for a free ball, Brazilian Jair Rosa Pinto fractured Argentine captain José Salomón's tibia and fibula. General disorder ensued, with Argentine and Brazilian players fighting on the pitch with the police. The public invaded the pitch and both teams had to go to the dressing rooms. After order was restored the game continued, and Argentina won the match 2–0. Salomón never recovered completely nor played professional football after the incident. It would be the first-ever meeting between Brazil and Argentina in the FIFA World Cup. Defending champions Brazil faced Argentina in West Germany's Niedersachsenstadion in Hanover in the second round as both were placed in Group A. Brazil won it by 2–1 via goals from Rivellino and Jairzinho whereas Brindisi scored the only goal for Argentina. The Group B of the second round was essentially a battle between Argentina and Brazil, and it was resolved in controversial circumstances. In the first round of group games, Brazil beat Peru 3–0 while Argentina saw off Poland 2–0. Brazil and Argentina then played out a tense and violent goalless draw – also known as "A Batalha de Rosário" ("The Battle of Rosario"), so both teams went into the last round of matches with three points. Argentina had an advantage that their match against Peru kicked off several hours after Brazil's match with Poland. Brazil won their match 3–1, so Argentina could know that they had to beat Peru by four clear goals to go through to the final. Argentina managed it with what some saw as a suspicious degree of ease. Trailing 2–0 at half-time, Peru simply collapsed in the second half, and Argentina eventually won 6–0. Rumours suggested that Peru might have been somehow illicitly induced not to try too hard (especially because the Peruvian goalkeeper, Ramón Quiroga, was born in Argentina); but nothing could be proved, and Argentina met the Netherlands in the final. Brazil, denied a final place by Argentina's 6–0 win over Peru, took third place from an enterprising Italy side and were dubbed "moral champions" by coach Cláudio Coutinho, because they did not win the tournament but did not lose a single match either. Brazil and Argentina were grouped together (along with Italy) in the second group stage in Group C, which was dubbed as the "group of death". In the opener, Italy prevailed 2–1 over Argentina. Argentina now needed a win over Brazil on the second day, but they were no match, as the Brazilians' attacking game, characterised by nimble, one-touch passing on-the-run, eclipsed the reigning world champions. The final score of 3–1 – Argentina only scoring in the last minute – could have been much higher had Brazil centre-forward Serginho not wasted a series of near-certain scoring opportunities. Frustrated because of the poor refereeing and the imminent loss, Diego Maradona kicked Brazilian player Batista and received a straight red card. Brazil lost their next game to Italy and thus exited the World Cup along with Argentina. The teams met in the World Cup Round of 16 at the 1990 World Cup. Argentina defeated Brazil 1–0 with a goal from Claudio Caniggia after a pass from Diego Maradona. The end of the match was controversial, however, with Brazilian player Branco accusing the Argentina training staff of giving him a bottle of water laced with tranquillizers while they were tending to an injured player. Years later, Maradona admitted the truth on an Argentine television show, saying that Branco had been given "holy water". The Argentine Football Association and the team coach of the time, Carlos Bilardo, denied that the "holy water" incident ever took place, though prior to the previous denial Bilardo said of Branco's allegation: "I'm not saying it didn't happen." Argentina defeated Brazil 3–2 in Santiago in the first match of the final pool. Five players were sent off: Claudio Caniggia and Mazinho after tangling in the 31st minute; Carlos Enrique and Márcio Santos for another fight in the 61st minute, with one player leaving on a stretcher; and Careca Bianchezi in the 80th minute, two minutes after coming on as a substitute. Argentina and Brazil finished 1–1 in the quarterfinal match, played in Guayaquil. Brazil took the lead, but Leonardo Rodríguez drew with the head after a corner kick in the second half. In penalties, Los Gauchos defeated Brazil 5–4 and advanced to the semi-finals. Argentina won the Copa América title after defeating Mexico in the final. Held in Uruguay, the two nations met at the quarter-finals stage on 17 July 1995. The Brazilian Túlio became famous for scoring a late equalizer five minutes from time after controlling the ball with his left arm. Despite the obvious foul, the referee, Alberto Tejada Noriega of Peru, claimed he did not see the incident and the goal therefore stood. The game finished with a 2–2 draw and Brazil went on to win on penalties. The Argentine media labeled the incident as the "hand of the devil", a reference to the controversial goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup against England. Argentina was winning 2–1, but in a spectacular turn of events, Adriano scored a goal in the last minute of the match, taking the match to penalties, where Brazil won with Júlio César stopping a shot from Andrés D'Alessandro. Brazil were playing with its second-string team. In 2005, Brazil and Argentina participated in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. Brazil entered the competition as the reigning World Cup champion at the time. Since Brazil had also won the Copa América the previous year, however, Copa runners-up Argentina was allowed to participate in the tournament to take up the vacated berth. In the semi-finals, Brazil eliminated host nation Germany, while Argentina eliminated Mexico. This competition was the first time the two rivals would meet in a final game of a tournament sponsored by FIFA. In a surprising turn of events, the Brazilian team won the game easily, thrashing the Argentines 4–1. Adriano scored twice for Brazil, along with Kaká and Ronaldinho, while Pablo Aimar scored Argentina's only goal. Brazil defeated Argentina 3–0 in Maracaibo, Venezuela, in the final. The goals scored were by Júlio Baptista, an own goal by Roberto Ayala, and Dani Alves. Defending champions Argentina and Brazil met on 19 August in the semi-final of the Summer Olympics. The game was billed as a tête-à-tête between Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho, two Barcelona teammates. It was a hard-fought clash between two historic rivals, marred by numerous fouls and two red cards for Brazil. Argentina convincingly won with a score of 3–0, and went on to beat Nigeria 1–0 in the final, being the first to obtain two consecutive gold medals in football in 40 years, and the third overall after the Olympic teams of the United Kingdom and Uruguay. Brazil eventually won the gold medal at the Olympics themselves playing at home in 2016. Brazil and Argentina met at the semifinal of the 2019 Copa América, which was hosted in Brazil. Brazil defeated Argentina 2–0 with goals by Gabriel Jesus and Firmino. Argentina eventually placed third and Brazil went on to win their 9th Copa América title. The 2021 Copa América was originally scheduled to be jointly held in Colombia and Argentina in 2020, but it was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Colombia and Argentina were removed as hosts due to social unrest in Colombia and the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina. Brazil was chosen to host the tournament. In the final, Argentina defeated Brazil 1–0 with the only goal by Ángel Di María at the Maracanã Stadium to win their 15th Copa América title, their first in 28 years. On 22 November 2023, Argentina defeated Brazil 1–0 again at the Maracanã in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier that was delayed due to crowd violence. It was the first time in history that Brazil were defeated at home in a FIFA World Cup qualification match after a run of 51 wins and 13 draws. Note: Only official competitions (organised by CONMEBOL and/or other continental confederations) are included Note Defunct competition. In the history of this tournament, played since 1960, only twice has a Brazilian team captured a title on Argentine soil. In 1963, Brazilian side Santos defeated the most popular Argentine club, Boca Juniors, and in 2017, when Grêmio defeated Club Atlético Lanús . However, the same Argentine club team, Boca Juniors, has celebrated three of its six titles on Brazilian soil, defeating Palmeiras in 2000, Santos in 2003 and Grêmio in 2007. The two greatest Argentine and Brazilian players that have ever played this sport had at one point played in these same two clubs: Pelé for Santos while Diego Maradona had done the same for Boca Juniors. It has been reported that in all three of Boca Juniors' victories on Brazilian soil, Boca's players were not allowed to properly sleep in their hotel rooms the night before their final matches because of the chaos and noise created by Brazilian fans outside the hotel rooms, who attempted to disrupt the Argentine players from performing to their best of their abilities the following day. In the international arena, the most successful Argentine clubs are Boca Juniors (six Libertadores and three Intercontinental Cups), Independiente (seven Libertadores and two Intercontinental Cups), Estudiantes de La Plata (four Libertadores and one Intercontinental Cup), River Plate (four Libertadores and one Intercontinental Cup), Vélez Sársfield (one Libertadores and one Intercontinental), San Lorenzo (one Libertadores, one Copa Mercosur and one Copa Sudamericana), Argentinos Juniors (one Libertadores) and Racing Club (one Libertadores and one Intercontinental Cup). The most successful Brazilian clubs are São Paulo (three Libertadores, one FIFA Club World Cup and two Intercontinental Cups), Santos (three Libertadores and two Intercontinental Cups), Grêmio (three Libertadores and one Intercontinental Cup), Palmeiras (three Libertadores, one Copa Mercosur and one Recopa Sudamericana), Internacional (two Libertadores and one FIFA Club World Cup), Cruzeiro (two Libertadores), Corinthians (one Libertadores and two FIFA Club World Cups), Flamengo, (two Libertadores, one Copa Mercosur, one Copa de Oro, one Recopa and one Intercontinental Cup), Vasco da Gama (one Libertadores and one Copa Mercosur) AND Atlético Mineiro (one Libertadores and two Copa Conmebol). The Brazil women's national team is a successful women's football team. It was runner-up in the FIFA Women's World Cup of 2007, and won a silver medal at the Olympic games in 2004 and 2008. In comparison, Argentina does not have a professional (or even semi-professional) women's football league; the members of the Argentina women's national football team are all amateur players despite their clubs often being affiliated with prominent men's professional clubs. Although the two teams usually have to battle for the top qualification spots for CONMEBOL when the World Cup qualification comes around, this rivalry does not provide the passion that men's matches encounter yet. Brazil won every game of the Sudamericano Femenino against Argentina until the 2006 edition, when Argentina finally beat them 2–0 in the final group stage, awarding Argentina the championship. Argentina did not participate in the 1991 South American competition and was second to Brazil in the following three tournaments. Beginning with the 2003 edition, both champion and runner-up qualified for the World Cup. As Argentina has not been past the group stages in the World Cup, the two teams have not met in the Olympic Football Tournament yet.
