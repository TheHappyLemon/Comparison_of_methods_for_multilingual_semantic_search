Population: 33,754 (2022 estimate). It is located in the historic region of Podolia. There are many propositions as far as the origin of name of Zhmerynka is concerned. One of the ideas is that it may be derived from the Polish words, describing the handshake.[citation needed] Initially there were two neighbouring villages named Zmierzynki Wielkie ("Big Zmierzynki") and Zmierzynki Małe ("Small Zmierzynki"), administratively located in the Winnica County in the Bracław Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. The former was a possession of the Potocki family and the latter of the Głowacki family. The villages were annexed by Russia in the Second Partition of Poland (1793), and their names were Russified to Zhmerynka from the Polish Zmierzynka.[citation needed] In 1870 a railway station was built, and the settlement began to develop more rapidly. In 1903 it was granted city rights, however, the first mayor, Pole Karol Wroński, was appointed only in 1905. With the fall of Tsarist Russia during World War I, in 1917, the town became part of the newly established Ukrainian People's Republic. During the war between Poland, Ukraine and Soviet Russia, the town was captured successively by the Soviets in March 1919, by the Ukrainians in June 1919, by the Soviets in January 1920, by the Poles in April 1920, and by the Soviets in June 1920, eventually becoming part of the Soviet Union. The city suffered during the Soviet-perpetrated Holodomor in 1932–1933.
