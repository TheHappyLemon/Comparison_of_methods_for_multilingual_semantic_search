"I Don't Need a Man" is a song recorded by American girl group the Pussycat Dolls for their debut studio album PCD (2005). It was written and produced by Rich Harrison, with additional writing from Nicole Scherzinger, Kara DioGuardi, and Vanessa Brown. The song was released as the fifth single from the album on September 9, 2006, by A&M Records and Interscope Records. Musically, it draws from 1980s music and includes elements of dance, pop, and R&B. Inspired by Destiny's Child's "Independent Women Part I" (2000), the song is a post-disco that feautures feminist themes and rejects objectification and co-dependency, while part of the chorus alludes to masturbation. It has been compared to works by Beyoncé, Inner City, and Meghan Trainor. "I Don't Need a Man" was met with a warm reception from music critics for its catchiness, themes, and sound. Over the years, the song has appeared on lists of the best feminist songs and best songs about masturbation by various publications. Commercially, it gave the Pussycat Dolls fifth consecutive top-ten single in Australia, Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The music video, directed by Chris Applebaum, showcases the group's "female ways" and is compared to the film, Grease (1978) by member Ashley Roberts. It received a nomination for Sexiest Video at the 2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards. The Pussycat Dolls originated as a burlesque dance ensemble founded by choreographer Robin Antin in 1993. Over the years, the troupe gained popularity which resulted in Antin strucking a deal with Jimmy Iovine—then president of Interscope Geffen A&M Records—to develop the Pussycat Dolls into a brand and create a pop girl group, with Iovine assigning the project to producer Ron Fair. Iovine considered the Pussycat Dolls as one of the "label's high-priority projects" and began enlisting various producers and songwriters to "ensure [a] maximum radio friendl[y]" sound for the debut album, PCD (2005). Amongst the recruits, Rich Harrison wrote and produced "I Don't Need a Man". Additional songwriters include, lead singer Nicole Scherzinger, who assumed the majority of the vocals and is the only member of the group to have songwriting credits on their album, Kara DioGuardi, and Vanessa "VV" Brown. Brown was hired by Fair to record backing vocals for the group's album. During one session, she unintentionally wrote the song's middle-eight while improvising the improvising bassline. Brown was surprised her contribution was kept. Fair provided additional and vocal production for the song. Tal Herzberg engineered and used Pro-Tools for the track. Further engineering was carried out by Scotty Beats, JD Andrew, Mike Hogue, and Mike "Angry" Eleopoulos. Peter Mokran mixed "I Don't Need a Man" at the Record Plant studios in Los Angeles. Member Ashley Roberts first confirmed on the group's website that "I Don't Need a Man" would be released as the fifth single in Europe. "I Don't Need a Man" A 23-second sample of the chorus of "I Don't Need a Man", whose instrumentation also consists of "blaring horns." Problems playing this file? See media help. Musically, "I Don't Need a Man" is a post-disco song, featuring elements of dance, pop and R&B while channeling 1980s tropes. The uptempo track, is backed by "blaring horns", "shuffling coconut beat", glockenspiel, synths, the piano, and the wurlitzer. It has a length of 3:39 and is composed in the key of D minor and set in common time, with a moderate groove of 105 beats per minute. The group's vocal range spans from the low note of A3 to the high note of D5. Critics have liken the sound to the works of Beyoncé and Inner City. Scherzinger was inspired to write "I Don't Need a Man" after Destiny's Child's "Independent Women Part I" (2000), which featured feministic themes such as economic independence from men. Similarly, "I Don't Need a Man" advocates for female empowerment and reminds listeners "that there’s a difference between wanting a man and needing one." The song also rejects objectification and co-dependency, while the chorus ends with lyrics alluding to masturbation: "I don't need a ring around my finger / To make me feel complete / So let me break it down / I can get off when you ain't around." Thematically, critics have noted the song is a prequel to Beyoncé's "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" (2008) and Meghan Trainor's "No" (2016). Following, PCD's release, Elysa Gardner from USA Today highlighted "I Don't Need a Man" as one of the album's "better tracks" adding it "[sparkles] despite [the group's] superficiality." Linda McGee of RTÉ was confident would "get much airplay in the future" noting it grabs the listener's attention instantly. Likewise, Emily Tan from Idolator wrote that after "one round of listening to [the song], single women, gay men and the like will be ready to get dolled up for a great night out." Chuck Arnold and Ralph Novak from People magazine lauded the song's themes and production, deeming it as one of the album's best songs. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine regarded the songs as one of the album's catchiest songs. Nick Butler from Sputnikmusic found the song to be a departure in theme from the rest of the album, although still deemed it a good song. John Murphy from MusicOMH appreciated its synth instrumentation. Spence D. from IGN acknowledged the attempts to sound unique but felt it ultimately blends with other pop songs in mainstream radio. A writer for the The Irish Times criticized the song for its formulaic themes writing, "It's the oldest chick trick in the book - act all independent and we'll come running back, begging like dogs. The laugh is, we fall for it every time." "I Don't Need a Man" appeared on many publications' lists of the best songs under different topics. Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, and Nylon magazines, Pride.com, and Thought Catalog, listed the song as one best feminist songs. BuzzFeed, Glamour magazine, HuffPost, and Pitchfork listed the song in their list of best songs regarding masturbation.
