The historical flags of the British Empire and the overseas territories refers to the various flags that were used across the various Dominions, Crown colonies, protectorates, and territories which made up the British Empire and overseas territories. Early flags that were used across the Empire (including the then Thirteen Colonies which later became the United States of America) tended to be variations of the Red and Blue Ensigns of Great Britain with no colonial badges or coat of arms attached to them. In the first half of the 19th century, the first colonies started to acquire their own colony badges, but it was not until the UK Parliament passed the Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865 that the colonies were required to apply their own emblems. The following list contains all former and current flags that have been used across the Empire and as well as British overseas territories. Note: Australia formally became a country independent from the United Kingdom under the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 which formally adopted the Statute of Westminster 1931 and backdated the adoption to 3 September 1939. Note: Canada formally became an independent country from the United Kingdom under the Statute of Westminster 1931. Note: Although it had been self-governing since 1852, New Zealand formally became an independent country from the United Kingdom under the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947, which adopted the Statute of Westminster 1931. Note: South Africa formally became a country independent from the United Kingdom in 1931 after formally adopting the Statute of Westminster.
