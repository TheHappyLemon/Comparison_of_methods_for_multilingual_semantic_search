Sweden competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, from 9 to 25 February 2018. The Swedish Olympic Committee (Swedish: Sveriges Olympiska Kommitté, SOK) sent 116 athletes to the Games, 62 men and 54 women, to compete in nine sports. Jennie-Lee Burmansson set a new record as the youngest Swedish Winter Olympic participant. The team was highly successful, having won 7 gold, 6 silver and 1 bronze medal and earning the 6th place in the medal table. The result matched the number of Winter Olympic gold medals won in Torino in 2006 but beat that record by having more silver medals. The overall medal count of 14 was only one short of Sweden's Winter Olympic record, set in Sochi in 2014 with 15 medals. The following is the list of number of competitors participating at the Games per sport/discipline. Sweden also obtained a quota place in men's short track speed skating, but the Swedish Olympic Committee declined to send any athlete.
