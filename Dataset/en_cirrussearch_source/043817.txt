KF Vushtrria is a football club based in Vushtrri, Kosovo. The club was founded in 1922, and currently play their home games at the 7,000 seat capacity Ferki Aliu Stadium in the city of Vushtrri. Notable players to have played for the club include former Albania internationals Armend Dallku, Ahmed Januzi and Kosovo international Milot Rashica. KF Vushtrria was founded in 1922 and is the oldest football club in Kosovo. It has been competing domestically in Kosovo ever since. Throughout the years after World War II, Vushtrri became well known for the production of youth players within the club. Many of these players were transferred to other Kosovar clubs such as Prishtina and Trepça due to them playing in former Yugoslav First League. In 2012 the club was purchased by local steel galvanising plant, Llamkos GalvaSteel. When the club was taken over by Llamkos GalvaSteel and the Core Group, there were immediate investments made which resulted in the club winning their 2013–14 league title, which was the first in its history. Llamkos GalvaSteel then distanced itself from the club as did the club's owner Jeton Sadiku, leaving the financing and management in the hands of the Vushtrri municipality.
