The Sweden men's national basketball team (Swedish: Sveriges herrlandslag i basket) represents Sweden in international basketball competition. The national team is controlled by the Swedish Basketball Federation. Sweden has qualified for the EuroBasket ten times throughout their history. Their best tournament result was the 11th place finish at the 1995 edition. The Scandinavian squad has also qualified for the Olympic Games once, in 1980, finishing in 10th place. However, Sweden still seeks qualification for their first appearance to the FIBA World Cup. Sweden's European Basketball Championship debut came at EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow. Although the Swedes did not fare well in their first tournament appearance. As they lost all seven of their matches to finish in last place in the 17 team tournament. Sweden's second appearance on the continental level came at EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest. The team got off to an demoralizing start by losing to Switzerland in their first match. Although Sweden would achieve their first ever win at the EuroBasket against Luxembourg in their second match of the preliminary phase. However, they followed it by losing their next two matches in the round as well to Romania, and the Soviet Union. They finished 4th out of the 5 teams in the group with an (1-3) record, and found themselves in the classification rounds. There, the team once again finished with an (1-3) record in their pool, with their only victory coming against Denmark. Two losses in the classification 13th–16th place semifinals and the 15th/16th place final (a rematch against Luxembourg) put Sweden at 16th place of the 18 teams. Sweden qualified for the EuroBasket eight more times with their three best finishes coming in 1969, 1983 and 1995. They also made their lone Summer Olympics appearance in 1980. But overall the national team has struggled to reach an elite level of consistency to become a serious medal contender at major international tournaments. At some events, however, the team displayed potential. E.g. at the EuroBasket 2013 they beat the heavily favored former champion Russia 81-62.   Win   Loss Sweden  v  Bulgaria Montenegro  v  Sweden Sweden  v  Germany Germany  v  Sweden Bulgaria  v  Sweden Sweden  v  Montenegro Roster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 22 and 25 February 2024 against Bulgaria and Montenegro.
