The first signing of the new club was Petri Huttu. There were several negotiations about the merger over the years. The main reason was the inadequacy of players. The clubs continued doing junior work after the merger, but could also have their own team in the lower divisions. The work name of the club was Seinäjoki Futis, and there was a contest about the official name, where everyone could suggest a name. The final name was Seinäjoen Jalkapallokerho, that had been suggested by many people. There was also a contest about the logo and uniform. The registered name of the club is Seinäjoen Jalkapallokerho ry, and it was registered on January 22, 2008. Mikko Latomäki was chosen as the first chairman. Jukka Saarijärvi was chosen as the vice chairman. Saarijärvi was a former TP-Seinäjoki chairman. In 2013 SJK started its second season in Ykkönen. In 2012 SJK had been placed second.
