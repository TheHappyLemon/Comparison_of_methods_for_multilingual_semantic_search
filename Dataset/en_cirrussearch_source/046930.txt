Sektor Gaza (Russian: Се́ктор Га́за, can be translated as a Gas Sector or Gaza Strip) was a Soviet and Russian punk rock band from Voronezh, founded in 1987 by Yuri Klinskikh. Sektor Gaza was founded in Voronezh by Yuri Klinskikh, also known as Yuri "Khoy". The group is named after an industrial district of Voronezh nicknamed Sektor Gaza due to its high levels of environmental contamination (also corresponds to the Russian name of Gaza Strip). Sektor Gaza's first performance as a group occurred at the local rock club on 9 June 1988, but the group's official date of establishment is traditionally given as 5 December 1987, the date of Klinskikh's first solo performance of material from Sektor Gaza's future repertoire at the Voronezh Rock Club. In 1989, the group recorded the demo tapes Plugi-vugi (Russian: Плуги-вуги, lit. 'Plows-woogie (i.e., pun on "Boogie-woogie")') and Kolkhozny pank (Russian: Колхозный панк, lit. 'Kolkhoz Punk'). In 1990, the group recorded the albums Zloveshchiye Mertvetsy (Russian: Зловещие Мертвецы, lit. 'The Sinister Dead') and Yadryona Vosh (Russian: Ядрёна Вошь, lit. 'Vigorous Louse') in a professional recording studio in Voronezh. Klinskikh sold his motorcycle in order to afford to rent the studio. In 1991, Sektor Gaza made their television debut, appearing on the programs 50x50 and Programma A (Russian: Программа А) on the Central Television of the USSR. The music video for "Kolkhozny pank" was shown on the youth program Do 16 i starshe... (Russian: До 16 и старше...), contributing to the group's fame across the country. In the same year, the group recorded the album Noch pered Rozhdestvom (Russian: Ночь перед Рождеством, lit. 'The Night Before Christmas') at the Mir studio in Moscow and rerecorded the album Kolkhozny pank at Gala Records. In 1992, Sektor Gaza released their sixth studio album, Gulyay, muzhik! (Russian: Гуляй, мужик!, lit. 'Have fun, man!') and toured extensively. In 1993, the group released Nazhmi na gaz (Russian: Нажми на газ, lit. 'Hit the gas'). In 1994, Sektor Gaza released Kashchey Bessmertny (Russian: Кащей Бессмертный, lit. 'Kashchey the Immortal'), a punk-opera based on the famous Russian folklore figure. On this album, Klinskikh performed original lyrics to the melodies of songs by groups such as AC/DC, Queen, Ace of Base, and Nirvana. In 1995, the group performed at the Rock Summer festival in Tallinn. They also toured Germany and Israel and performed at the Gorbunov Palace of Culture. In 1996, Sektor Gaza released Gazovaya Ataka (Russian: Газовая Атака), which marked a change in the group's style and a move away from obscene lyrics. The music video for the track "Tuman" (Russian: «Туман», lit. 'Fog') off this album made it into the rotation of many Russian television channels. In 1997, the group released Narcologichesky Universitet Millionov (Russian: Наркологический Университет Миллионов, lit. 'Narcological University of Millions'). The song "Pora domoy" (Russian: «Пора домой», lit. 'Time to go home') from this album became a hit. In the summer of 1998, Klinskikh and Aleksey Bryantsev (DJ Krot) arranged some Sektor Gaza songs as techno remixes, which were released on the album Extasy in 1999. In October 2000, the group released a new album, Vosstavshy iz Ada (Russian: Восставший из Ада, lit. 'Hellraiser'). Klinskikh's health was in decline due to liver disease. On 4 July 2000, Klinskikh complained of strong pains in his stomach and the left side of his chest. He chose not to cancel a meeting later that day to film a music video. He suffered heart failure shortly thereafter. Klinskikh died in Voronezh at the age of 35. 1989: Плуги-вуги (Plows-woogie) 1989: Колхозный Панк (Kolkhoz Punk) 1990: Зловещие Мертвецы (The Evil Dead) 1990: Ядрёна Вошь (Vigorous Louse) 1991: Ночь перед Рождеством (The Night before Christmas) 1991: Колхозный Панк (Kolkhoz Punk) 1992: Гуляй, мужик!
