Greenwich Island (variant historical names Sartorius Island, Berezina Island) is an island 24 km (15 mi) long and from 0.80 to 9.66 km (0.5 to 6 mi) (average 5.23 km or 3.25 mi) wide, lying between Robert Island and Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.The island's surface area is 142.7 square kilometres (55.1 sq mi). The name Greenwich Island dates back to at least 1821 and is now established in international usage. The Chilean base Arturo Prat and the Ecuadorian base Pedro Vicente Maldonado are situated on the northeast and north coast of the island, respectively. Chilean scientists have claimed that Amerinds visited the area, due to stone artifacts recovered from bottom-sampling operations off the island; however, the artefacts — two arrowheads — were later found to have been planted.
