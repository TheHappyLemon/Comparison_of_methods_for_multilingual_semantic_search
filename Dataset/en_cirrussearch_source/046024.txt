In addition to that Vestermanis received religious education from a rabbi at the age of 6 until he turned 15. His father had most of his possessions confiscated by the Soviet authorities after Latvia's occupation in 1940. Upon the arrival of the Wehrmacht after the Nazi occupation of Latvia in 1941, the family was taken to the Riga Ghetto, where Marģers had to work as a homemaker, assisting the underground resistance movement of the ghetto at the same time. All members of the family and relatives, except Marģers, were killed in the Rumbula massacre in late 1941. After the ghetto was closed in 1943, he was interned in the Kaiserwald concentration camp. He was subjected to forced labor at the SS-Truppenübungsplatz Seelager and the neighboring camps Poperwahlen (Popervāle) and Dondangen (in Dundaga). Sent on a death march towards Liepāja in late 1944, he was able to escape into the woods nearby Ugāle, where he later joined a group of Soviet partisans, with whom he spent the rest of the war.
