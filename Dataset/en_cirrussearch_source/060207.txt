Martin Nikolai Røymark (born November 10, 1986) is a Norwegian professional ice hockey winger, currently playing for Vålerenga Ishockey of the Norwegian Get-ligaen (GET). On October 5, 2008, Røymark was invited to practice with Frölunda HC of the Elitserien for three days, pending further evaluation of him. On October 8, a press release said that he would return to his Norwegian team. However, it was decided that two parties would stay in touch. In the 2009–10 Elitserien season, he played 55 matches for Frölunda, scoring five goals and having four assists. On April 12, Frölunda's General Manager, Kent Norberg, stated that they needed to reduce the number of forwards in the club. As a result, Røymark, Joakim Andersson, and Jens Karlsson was released from their contract, along with defenceman Janne Niskala. "Ackeström försvinner och Röymark tränar med Frölunda". Frölunda HC.
