Anton Vladimirovich Shunin (Russian: Антон Владимирович Шунин; born 27 January 1987) is a Russian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Dynamo Moscow and the Russian national team. Shunin is a youth product of Dynamo Moscow. He made his debut on 21 April 2007 in a 2–1 win over Khimki.[citation needed] On 17 November 2012, Shunin was struck by a firecracker thrown from the stands during a Russian Premier League match against FC Zenit Saint Petersburg.

On 4 August 2020, he was voted Player of the Year by Dynamo fans for the 2019–20 season, the prize he also won in 2018–19. He was voted player of the month again for August 2020 and September 2020. On 16 November 2021, he extended his contract until the end of the 2023–24 season. Due to presence of Igor Akinfeev, another Russian one-club man goalkeeper of CSKA Moscow fame, Shunin's opportunities in the national team have been limited for most part of his senior career.

He was confirmed for the finalized UEFA Euro 2012 squad on 25 May 2012. After another 6 years without call-ups, he was included in the squad for the games against Turkey and Czech Republic in September 2018, two months after then retirement of goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev from international football. He played his first competitive match for his country on 19 November 2019 in a Euro 2020 qualifier against San Marino, keeping a clean sheet.[citation needed] In the UEFA Nations League in 2020, Shunin gradually became the first choice goalkeeper of the national team.[citation needed] On 11 May 2021, he was included in the preliminary extended 30-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020. On 2 June 2021, he was included in the final squad. He played the opening game against Belgium as Russia lost 0–3. He did not appear in the remaining games as Russia was eliminated at group stage.
