Siquijor, officially the Municipality of Siquijor (Cebuano: Lungsod sa Siquijor; Tagalog: Bayan ng Siquijor), is a 4th class municipality and capital of the province of Siquijor, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 28,915 people. While Spanish priests arrived in Siquijor as early as 1780, it was not until 1794 that the town became a municipality, the same year the parish was established. In 2022, in the 19th Congress of the Philippines, various representatives filed house bills that sought Siquijor, including other capital towns of provinces with no current component cities, independent component cities, or highly urbanized cities, to automatically convert into cities. Siquijor is politically subdivided into 42 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.
