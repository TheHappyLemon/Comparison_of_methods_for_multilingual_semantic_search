This is a chronological list of expeditions to the International Space Station (ISS). An expedition to the ISS refers to the crew that is occupying the space station and using it for research and testing. Expeditions can last up to six months and include between two and seven crew members. Expeditions are numbered starting from one and sequentially increased with each expedition. Resupply mission crews and space tourists are excluded (see List of human spaceflights to the ISS for details). ISS commanders are listed in italics. "Duration" is the period of time between the crew's launch from Earth and until their decoupling from the ISS. Future international collaboration on ISS activities has been thrown into doubt by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions on Russia.

Alongside the 3 other crew members, Megan McArthur used the same seat of the SpaceX Crew Dragon Endeavour in this mission, which her husband Bob Behnken used in SpaceX Demo-2 mission, the first mission of the Endeavour capsule. The European portion of SpaceX Crew-2 is called Alpha and is headed by Thomas Pesquet. The European portion of SpaceX Crew-3 is called Cosmic Kiss and is headed by Matthias Maurer.
