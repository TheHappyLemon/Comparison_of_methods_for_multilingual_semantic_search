Parang, officially the Municipality of Parang (Maguindanaon: Inged nu Parang, Jawi: ايڠايد نو ڤارڠ; Iranun: Inged a Parang, ايڠايد ا ڤارڠ; Tagalog: Bayan ng Parang), is a 1st class municipality in the province of Maguindanao del Norte, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 102,914 people. The town was part of the province of Shariff Kabunsuan from October 2006 until its nullification by the Supreme Court in July 2008. Parang is the seat of government of the Bangsamoro autonomous region. However the relevant infrastructure are yet to be put in place. The history of Parang traces back to the era when it used to be an integral part of the Maguindanao Sultanate. In June 1851, the Spanish military government based in Zamboanga sent forces to Polloc, presently a barangay of Parang, and seized it. Having a natural deep water harbor, the Spanish then set up a fortress and a naval base at Polloc, from which they would launch military operations against the Moros of the Pulangui Valley. Polloc eventually grew into a small town that by 1860 it was home to 600 Christians and 50-60 Chinese traders along with people from other walks of life. In 1884, a road was built between Polloc and the other town of Cotabato, which was founded ten years later than Polloc in 1861 and now served as the capital of the 5th Military District of Cotabato in which Polloc was part of. The Americans took over local affairs when the Spanish evacuated at the aftermath of the Philippine-American War in 1901 and the American authorities replaced them. When political reorganization of the Philippine islands took place in 1917, Polloc was made part of the newly created municipal district of Parang. Parang as a municipality was created on August 18, 1947, through Executive Order No. 82 signed by President Manuel Roxas. The modern Polloc Port, which form the main part of the present-day Polloc Freeport and Economic Zone currently based in Barangay Polloc of Parang town, was constructed in 1977 and currently serves as the primary transshipment port in the Bangsamoro region. On June 19, 2023, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament approved a bill transferring the regional center of Bangsamoro from Cotabato City to Parang. It is bordered to the north by Barira and Matanog, on the east by Buldon, and on the south is Sultan Kudarat. Parang is politically subdivided into 25 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios. Bongo Island (Litayen) Campo Islam Cotongan Datu Macarimbang Biruar Gadungan Gadungan Pedpandaran Guiday T.
