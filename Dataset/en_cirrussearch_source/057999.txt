Mikkel Hansen (born 22 October 1987) is a Danish professional handball player for Aalborg Håndbold and the Danish national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest handball players of all time, Hansen has won the IHF World Player of the Year a record-tying three times. He was voted as the IHF World Player of the Year in 2011, 2015 and 2018 by the International Handball Federation. He joined FC Barcelona Handbol in June 2008. He previously played for Danish Handball League club GOG, with whom he won the Danish championship in 2007.

Mikkel Hansen is an Olympic Champion, a World Champion, and European Champion with the Danish national team, winning the 2016 title in Rio de Janeiro, the 2019 title in Denmark, and 2012 title in Serbia.

Later, that same year, he was named the best in the world for the third time of his career.[citation needed] In 2021, he yet again won the World Championship with Denmark and was selected both as the best left back and as MVP. In the 2020 Olympics, where Denmark got a silver medal, he was again chosen as the best left back, and he became the top goal scorer with 61 goals.
