The Taube family is an ancient Baltic-German noble family, originally from Denmark, Jutland whose earliest roots can be traced from Westphalia, Germany. The family historic references: Engelke Tuve (Taube) 1373 Danish vassal in Estonia. Another branch is known to have existed on the feudal estate of Wedewes. The other historic persons: vassals Tuvi Leos and Tuve Collae, 1240 in Estonia. In the 17th century, during Swedish Empire period, several members of the family joined Swedish kings. Berndt Taube was recognized a Baron (friherre) of Carlöö in Österbotten in 1652. Edvard Taube, was introduced at the Swedish House of Nobility in 1668[citation needed] and became the ancestor of the untitled noble family Taube (adliga ätten Taube no 734). Also, Edvard's son Fredrik Evert Taube was made a Baron (friherre) in 1692 (Taube of Odenkat) and Fredrik Evert's son Edvard Didrik Taube was made a Count in 1734, becoming the ancestor of the counts of Taube (grevliga ätten Taube no. 112). Another line of counts (grevliga ätten Taube no. 62) is descended from the Governor General of Narva, Ingermanland and Kexholm Jakob Johan Taube of Kuddinge (Livonia) and Sesswegen (Latvia) (1624–1695), whose son, Gustaf Adam (1673–1732), became a count in 1719.
