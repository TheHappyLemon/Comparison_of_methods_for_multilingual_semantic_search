The 1972–73 season of the European Cup football club tournament was won for the third consecutive time by Ajax in the final against Juventus at Red Star Stadium in Belgrade. The win by Ajax resulted in the fourth consecutive championship by a Dutch team. Since Ajax had won the cup for a third time, they got to keep the full size copy of the cup. Because the reigning European champions were also champions of their own league, and neither Albania nor Northern Ireland sent their champions, the number of participating clubs dropped from 33 to 30. Originally 1–2 to Panathinaikos, with CSKA winning the subsequent penalty shoot-out 3–2. Panathinaikos complained to UEFA, and the match was annulled and replayed the following month. The match was played at FK Sarajevo's Stadion Koševo due to Željezničar's Grbavica ground undergoing renovations. 13 September 1972 Vasil Levski National Stadium, Sofia Attendance: 21,901 13 September 1972 Mithat Paşa Stadyumu Attendance: 42,850 13 September 1972 Kilcohan Park, Waterford Attendance: 2,544 Referee: René Vigliani (France) 13 September 1972 19:30 Tivoli, Innsbruck Attendance: 8,655 Referee: Theo Boosten (Netherlands) 13 September 1972 Empire Stadium, Gżira Attendance: 3,898 13 September 1972 Stade Josy Barthel, Bonnevoie Attendance: 350 Referee: Joseph Minnoy (Belgium) 13 September 1972 Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Madrid Attendance: 30,000 13 September 1972 Stade de Gerland, Lyon Attendance: 21,403 13 September 1972 Ernst-Grube-Stadion, Magdeburg Attendance: 16,119 13 September 1972 Hampden Park, Glasgow Attendance: 18,489 13 September 1972 Megyeri úti Stadion, Budapest Attendance: 4,282 13 September 1972 Stade Emile Versé, Anderlecht Attendance: 7,837 13 September 1972 Baseball Ground, Derby Attendance: 27,350 13 September 1972 Malmö Stadion, Malmö Attendance: 9,492 Referee: Wolfgang Riedel (East Germany) 27 September 1972 Leofóros, Athens Attendance: 24,927 The game was annulled because the referee ended the shoot-out prematurely after Panathinaikos fourth penalty was saved by Bulgarian goalkeeper.
