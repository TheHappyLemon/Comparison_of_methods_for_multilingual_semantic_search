"Girls & Boys" is the third single taken from American rock band Good Charlotte's second studio album, The Young and the Hopeless (2002). The song was released in Europe on April 28, 2003, and was issued in the United States and Australia later in the year. "Girls & Boys" peaked at number 48 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number six in the United Kingdom, receiving a silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 2018 for sales and streams exceeding 200,000 units. Elsewhere, the single reached the top 40 in Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand. Principal photography for the video took place in the suburb of Ellerslie in Auckland, New Zealand predominantly featuring geriatric people dressed and acting like stereotypical hardcore punk youths for comedic effect. The various members of the band are shown interacting with the older characters (for example Billy and Paul playing video games, Benji giving massages and Joel doing a dance number with woman in tracksuits. At the end of the video, Benji wakes up to find an old woman wearing one of his shirts and offering him a bowl of cereal, but the official YouTube edit omits this scene, with another omitted mid-video scene of dialogue with a senior woman walks up to the band sitting on the curb asking what they'd like to do and then proposing they "trash the mall", a parodying reference to Avril Lavigne's 2002 video "Complicated".
