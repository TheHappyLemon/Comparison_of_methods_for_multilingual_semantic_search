They had been stranded for three days after their vessel was overturned by a large wave after departing Pulap island, forcing them to swim two miles to shore at night. They were rescued by the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard after a passing plane spotted the message and notified the authorities. "Oceandots - Pulap". Archived from the original on December 23, 2010.
