Bilohirsk Raion (Ukrainian: Білогірський район, Russian: Белогорский район, Crimean Tatar: Qarasuvbazar rayonı) is one of the 25 regions of Crimea, currently occupied by Russian Federation. Population: 60,445 (2014 Census). This landlocked region is situated in the foothills of the central Crimea. The raion's administrative centre is the historical town of Bilohirsk. In July 2020, Ukraine conducted an administrative reform throughout its de jure territory. This included Crimea, which was at the time occupied by Russia, and is still ongoing as of October 2023. Crimea was reorganized from 14 raions and 11 municipalities into 10 raions, with municipalities abolished altogether. The territory of Bilohirsk Raion was expanded to also include the territories of Nyzhnohirskyi Raion, but has not yet been implemented due to the ongoing Russian occupation. This place is located on the Crimean peninsula, which is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine, but since 2014 under Russian occupation. According to the administrative-territorial division of Ukraine, there are the Ukrainian divisions (the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city with special status of Sevastopol) located on the peninsula. Russia claims these as federal subjects of the Russian Federation (the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol). Russian Federal State Statistics Service (2014). "Таблица 1.3.
