Formerly a village, it owes its rapid rise in population mainly to the establishment of steel mills in the 1950s. These works, among the largest in the country, specialize in high-quality alloy steel and machinery. In the 1960s chemical plants were added.[verification needed] Kırıkkale province is divided into 9 districts (capital district in bold): Bahşılı Balışeyh Çelebi Delice Karakeçili Keskin Kırıkkale Sulakyurt Yahşihan Delice River valley near Yeni Yapan List of populated places in Kırıkkale Province "Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports" (XLS).
