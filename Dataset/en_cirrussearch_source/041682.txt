Aymen Mathlouthi (Arabic: أَيْمَن الْمَثْلُوثِيّ; born 14 September 1984), also known as Balbouli, is a Tunisian former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Regarded by pundits as the best Tunisian goalkeepers and one of the best African goalkeepers of all time, some of his highlighted traits apart from goalkeeping, is his smooth ball control, and dribbling inside the penalty area. Mathlouthi won the 2011 African Nations Championship held in Sudan. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) chose Mathlouthi as the best goalkeeper in the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations held in Equatorial Guinea, being also included in the CAF Team of the Tournament. He was Tunisia's starting goalkeeper vs Panama at the last group stage match of the 2018 World Cup, which also marked his World Cup debut. Called-up for the 2022 World Cup, it was his second representing his country. From his earliest years, Mathlouthi joined the team's training center in his hometown (Djebel Lahmar in El Omrane), at the "Jeunesse Sportive d'El Omrane", where he trained as a goalkeeper. In 1995, he decided to join Club Africain. Later, he joined Étoile du Sahel based in Sousse in 1998 and achieved all possible national and continental glory at the club. He also participated at the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan and finished in fourth place after defeating Mexican team CF Pachuca in the quarter-finals 1–0. On 27 January 2018, he joined Saudi club Al-Batin on a free transfer. On 23 July 2018, he returned to Club Africain, where he started his professional career, in a two-year deal.
