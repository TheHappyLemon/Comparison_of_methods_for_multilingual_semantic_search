Maximillian James Aarons (born 4 January 2000) is an English professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Premier League club Bournemouth. Aarons began his career at Luton Town, and moved to join Norwich City's academy in 2016. He signed a three-year professional contract with the Canaries in June 2018, before making his debut in an EFL Cup game against Stevenage on 14 August. His first senior goal also came in the EFL Cup, as he concluded a 3–1 win over Cardiff City two weeks later. Aarons made his first league appearance on 2 September, starting in the East Anglian derby against Ipswich Town, a 1–1 draw. On 10 October, he extended his contract at the club until June 2023. In March 2019 Aarons was included in the 2018–19 Championship Team of the Season, and was also awarded the 2018–19 EFL Young Player of the Season award. He was promoted with Norwich to the Premier League after a 2–1 victory over Blackburn Rovers. In April 2021 Aarons was nominated for the EFL Young Player of the Season. In January 2022, Aarons made his 150th appearance for Norwich City in a Premier League match against West Ham United. By now, he was well-established as Norwich's first choice right back and would miss only two games during the rest of the season, as a result of an injury sustained in a match against Leeds United. At the end of the season, he would experience relegation from the Premier League for the second time. Aarons remained with Norwich for the subsequent 2022–23 season back in the Championship. In Norwich's first home game, Aarons scored an equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Wigan Athletic. He had to be substituted for Liam Gibbs in the match against Burnley in October, with Sam Byram replacing him for the subsequent game against Stoke City. This would be the only game of the season in which Aarons played no part, as he returned to the side as a substitute for Byram in the following game against Queens Park Rangers. After a strong start, Norwich slumped and had soon lost any hope of being promoted again. The season, and ultimately Aaron's time with Norwich, ended with a 1–0 defeat to Blackpool. On 10 August 2023, Aarons transferred to AFC Bournemouth for a fee of £7m. On 12 August, he made his debut for the club in a 1–1 draw against West Ham United in the Premier League. After breaking into the Norwich City first team at the start of the 2018–19 season, Aarons earned a call-up to the England under-19 team in September 2018. On 30 August 2019, Aarons was included in the England U21 squad for the first time. He made his debut during the 3–2 qualifying win against Turkey on 6 September 2019. Aarons was a member of the squad that were eliminated at the group stage of the 2021 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Despite his England caps, in March 2021 it was reported that Aarons would be called up to the Jamaica national team, as part of a plot by the Jamaican Football Federation to purposely target a number of English and English-born players for call ups in order to increase the nation's chances of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. JFF president Michael Ricketts claimed that Aarons was going to apply for a Jamaican passport in order to play for the nation. However, Aarons subsequently revealed he had not been contacted by Jamaica, stating: "I am able to play for Jamaica but I never heard anything from them or whatever. I had people messaging me, a few family members from Jamaica, and I had to say that I hadn't heard anything". Aarons also revealed that he had no interest in playing for anyone other than his home nation, commenting: "my full focus is definitely on England". On 14 June 2023, Aarons was included in the England squad for the 2023 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He started in the final as England beat Spain 1–0 to win the tournament. Aarons is of Jamaican descent. He is the cousin of former Huddersfield Town player Rolando Aarons.
