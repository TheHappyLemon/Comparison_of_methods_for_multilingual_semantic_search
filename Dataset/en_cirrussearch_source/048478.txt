Royal Antwerp Football Club, often referred to as Royal Antwerp or simply Antwerp, is a Belgian professional football club based in the city of Antwerp. They are the reigning champions of Belgium, having won the 2022–23 Belgian Pro League, the top flight of Belgian football. RAFC is Founded around 1880 as Antwerp Cricket Club by English students residing in Antwerp, 15 years before the creation of the Royal Belgian Football Association, Antwerp is regarded as the oldest club in Belgium. At first there was no organised football played by its members, until 1887 when the football division was founded with its own board, named Antwerp Football Club. Being the oldest active club at the time, it was the first club to register to the Association in 1895. Consequently, when matricule numbers were introduced in 1926, the club received matricule number one. The team has won the Belgian league title five times and the Belgian Cup four times, including a double in 2022–23. In European competitions, it reached the final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1992–93 and qualified for the Group stage of UEFA Champions League for the first time in 2023. Over the course of the club's history, Royal Antwerp have won five Belgian league titles as well as four Belgian Cups. In 1900, most of the players left the club for the new neighbouring club of K. Beerschot V.A.C., and this was the start of a long rivalry between both clubs. The club is the most recent Belgian team to have reached a UEFA competition final, the 1993 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, where they lost 3–1 against Parma at Wembley Stadium. Royal Antwerp had a long-term partnership with the English club Manchester United, taking their young players on loan so that their development can be aided with first team football, and young players who require European work-permits can benefit from Belgium's more relaxed laws. An example of the latter was China international Dong Fangzhuo, who was unable to play for United immediately due to work permit problems and was loaned to allow him to gain first team experience. Despite being one of Belgium's best-supported clubs, Antwerp had been under-achievers for several years. They hadn't won a league title between 1957 and 2023, and have spent several seasons in the second division. They were promoted to the top flight in 2000, only to be relegated in short order in 2004. They returned to the first division after 13 years in 2017, after a 5–2 aggregate win over Roeselare. After achieving promotion back to the top flight, the club appointed experienced Romanian manager László Bölöni, and demoted his predecessor Wim De Decker to assistant. In his second season, 2018–19, the club qualified for the UEFA Europa League, their first European competition for the first time in 25 years. They won 3–2 in the playoff final against Charleroi, who had led 2–0 after 12 minutes. Their European campaign began with a win over Viktoria Plzeň on the away goals rule in the third qualifying round, followed by a 5–2 loss to AZ Alkmaar of the Netherlands in the playoff. In May 2020, Bölöni left at the end of his contract. Four months later, the Great Old won their first major trophy in nearly 30 years when they upset league champions Club Brugge in the final of the Belgian Cup, with a lone goal from former Brugge player Lior Refaelov. Ivan Leko, who managed the team in the cup final, led the team through the Europa League group stage in second place with four wins including one over José Mourinho's Tottenham Hotspur; he left for Shanghai Port at the end of 2020. Former Netherlands international Mark van Bommel was appointed manager in May 2022. He brought in several compatriots, including Vincent Janssen, who scored the first goal of a 2–0 win over neighbours Mechelen in the 2023 Belgian Cup final. On 4 June 2023, Antwerp won their fifth league title on the final day of the 2022–23 Belgian Pro League season. The 2–2 draw at Genk was secured in the fourth minute of added time by a screamer from Toby Alderweireld. On 30 August 2023, the club secured a spot in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League for the first time ever, following a 3–1 aggregate win over AEK Athens in the play-off round. Royal Antwerp have played their home matches at the Bosuilstadion since 1923. Royal Antwerp share a fierce rivalry with city neighbours Beerschot A.C. (now K Beerschot VA). Although in the 2000s-2010s the two clubs have met sparingly, when they do, there is usually fan violence. Royal Antwerp are often seen as a culture club with a diverse, cross-class support across the city while Beerschot have either heavily working class or upper class support, locally based in South Antwerp. Beerschot supporters often refer to RAFC fans as "joden" or "Jews" due to the fact that to get to Antwerp's stadium they must pass through the Jewish district, while Great Old supporters refer to Beerschot followers as "the rats". RAFC also have developed a long-standing rivalry with Club Brugge. They also have a local rivalry with KV Mechelen, although there is mutual respect due to a shared hatred of Beerschot. The best football players of Antwerp and Rotterdam contested a yearly match between 1909 and 1959 for the Meuse- and Scheldt Cup (Maas- en Schelde Beker). It was agreed to play the game at Antwerp's stadium De Bosuil in Belgium and at Sparta Rotterdam's Het Kasteel stadium in the Netherlands. The cup was provided in 1909 by P. Havenith from Antwerp and Kees van Hasselt from Rotterdam.
