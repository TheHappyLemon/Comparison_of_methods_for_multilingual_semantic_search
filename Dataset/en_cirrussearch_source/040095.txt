The white-bellied redstart (Luscinia phaenicuroides) is a species of bird of the family Muscicapidae. It is found in Bhutan, China, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam, where its natural habitat is temperate forests. The white-bellied redstart was previously the only species in the genus Hodgsonius. A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the white-bellied redstart formed part of a clade that included the common nightingale. The species was therefore moved to Luscinia.
