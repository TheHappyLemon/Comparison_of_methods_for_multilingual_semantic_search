"Black Smoke" is a song performed by German singer Ann Sophie. The song represented Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015, receiving zero points. Despite "Heart of Stone" by Andreas Kümmert being the original winner of the selection show Unser Song für Österreich, Kümmert decided to withdraw himself just when he was announced as the winner and therefore Ann Sophie and "Black Smoke" were chosen to represent the country. The song was co-written by British singer Ella Eyre. Black Smoke became the third German entry to get zero points at Eurovision, and the first one since Ulla Wiesner with "Paradies, wo bist du?" in 1965, 50 years earlier. After Ann Sophie was selected as the wildcard for the final of Unser Song für Österreich, "Black Smoke" was announced as her second song for the final. A snippet of one minute of the song was revealed on 27 February 2015. The song was available for download on 2 March 2015, a few days before the selection. Actually "Black Smoke" was meant to be interpreted by Ivy Quainoo. "Black Smoke" (2015) A 15-second sample taken from the track's chorus. Problems playing this file? See media help.
