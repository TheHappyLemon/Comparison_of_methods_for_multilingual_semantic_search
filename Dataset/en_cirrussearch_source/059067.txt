The 1986–87 season was the 32nd season of the European Cup, Europe's premier club football competition. The tournament was won by Porto, who came from behind in the final against Bayern Munich to give a Portuguese club its first title since 1962. Steaua București, the defending champions, were eliminated by Anderlecht in the second round, having received a bye to reach that stage of the tournament due to the absence of the English champions (Liverpool), as the ban on English clubs in European competitions was now in its second season. 17 September 1986 19:30 Parc des Princes, Paris Attendance: 14,865 Referee: Victoriano Sánchez Arminio (Spain) 17 September 1986 20:30 Estádio dos Arcos, Vila do Conde Attendance: 8,000 Referee: Joaquín Ramos Marcos (Spain) 17 September 1986 18:00 Brøndby Stadium, Brøndby Attendance: 6,438 Referee: Esa Palsi (Finland) 17 September 1986 18:00 Nya Ullevi, Gothenburg Attendance: 5,114 Referee: John Blankenstein (Netherlands) 17 September 1986 14:30 Ali Sami Yen Stadyumu, Istanbul Attendance: 15,814 Referee: Klaus Scheurell (East Germany) 17 September 1986 19:30 Makario Stadium, Nicosia Attendance: 12,000 Referee: Todor Kolev (Bulgaria) 17 September 1986 16:45 Glenmalure Park, Dublin Attendance: 19,000 Referee: Henk van Ettekoven (Netherlands) 17 September 1986 18:30 Beroe Stadium, Stara Zagora Attendance: 16,280 Referee: Gerasimos Germanakos (Greece) 17 September 1986 18:30 Philips Sportpark, Eindhoven Attendance: 26,750 Referee: Bob Valentine (Scotland) 17 September 1986 18:30 Stade rue Henri Dunant, Beggen Attendance: 474 Referee: Renzo Peduzzi (Switzerland) 17 September 1986 19:00 Constant Vanden Stock, Brussels Attendance: 9,359 Referee: Carlos Silva Valente (Portugal) 17 September 1986 18:00 Lerkendal Stadion, Trondheim Attendance: 3,258 Referee: Kjartan Ólofsson (Iceland) 17 September 1986 18:00 Stadion Crvena Zvezda, Belgrade Attendance: 85,000 Referee: Alexis Ponnet (Belgium) 17 September 1986 19:00 Wankdorf Stadium, Bern Attendance: 32,000 Referee: Paolo Casarin (Italy) 17 September 1986 Stadio Comunale, Turin Attendance: 18,518 Referee: Edgar Azzopardi (Malta) 1 October 1986 15:30 Městský, Ostrava Attendance: 8,605 Referee: John Martin (England) Vítkovice won 3–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 13:30 National Stadium, Ta' Qali Attendance: 2,000 Referee: Dragiša Komadinić (Yugoslavia) Porto won 10–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 18:00 Bozsik József Stadion, Budapest Attendance: 7,031 Referee: Ivan Timoshenko (Soviet Union) Brøndby won 6–3 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 13:30 Dynamo-Stadion in Sportforum, East Berlin Attendance: 15,000 Referee: Kurt Röthlisberger (Switzerland) Dynamo Berlin won 7–3 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 14:30 Qemal Stafa Stadium, Tirana Attendance: 17,500 Referee: Lajos Hartmann (Hungary) Beşiktaş won 3–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 18:00 Stadikka, Helsinki Attendance: 3,247 Referee: Janusz Eksztajn (Poland) 3–3 on aggregate; APOEL won on away goals. 1 October 1986 18:30 Celtic Park, Glasgow Attendance: 27,272 Referee: Håkan Lundgren (Sweden) Celtic won 3–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 19:00 Republican Stadium, Kyiv Attendance: 98,000 Referee: Vojtech Christov (Czechoslovakia) Dynamo Kyiv won 3–1 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 19:00 Olympiastadion, Munich Attendance: 32,000 Referee: Michel Vautrot (France) Bayern Munich won 2–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 18:00 Stadion Lehen, Salzburg Attendance: 3,500 Referee: Bela Szabo (Hungary) Austria Wien won 6–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 16:00 Stadion Zabrze, Zabrze Attendance: 19,300 Referee: Stadion Górnik (Austria) Anderlecht won 3–1 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 18:30 Windsor Park, Belfast Attendance: 3,464 Referee: Frans Van Den Wijngaert (Belgium) Rosenborg won 2–1 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 19:30 Spyros Louis, Athens Attendance: 57,708 Referee: Luigi Agnolin (Italy) Red Star Belgrade won 4–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 20:000 Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid Attendance: 75,000 Referee: Karl-Josef Assenmacher (West Germany) Real Madrid won 5–1 on aggregate. 1 October 1986 16:05 Laugardalsvöllur, Reykjavík Attendance: 6,050 Referee: Ib Nielsen (Denmark) Juventus won 11–0 on aggregate. 1 APOEL withdrew for political reasons. 22 October 1986 14:30 Městský, Ostrava Attendance: 7,261 Referee: George Smith (Scotland) 22 October 1986 17:30 Brøndby Stadium, Brøndby Attendance: 5,401 Referee: David F.
