Mambajao, officially the Municipality of Mambajao, is a 3rd class municipality and capital of the province of Camiguin, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 41,094 people. Mambajao is from Visayan mambahaw (archaic form of mamahaw), meaning "to eat breakfast"; from the root word bahaw, "leftover rice from [last night]". On January 4, 1855, Mambajao was separated from Catarman, and by July 6 that year it was proclaimed as a town, with Fr. Valero Salvo as its first parish priest. On July 17, 1864, tremors were felt across the town, which were signs of an ongoing activity within an undersea volcano near Catarman. By May 1, 1871, the volcano erupted, decimating the town of Catarman, which lead to almost all of its inhabitants moving to Mambajao. In January 1872, Barrio Agojo was transferred from Guinsiliban to Mambajao. The town's principal crop in the 19th century was abaca, while coffee and cacao were mostly produced for local consumption. Sporadic fires were started from April 13, 1865, until 1881 by people attempting to burn down the town. By the 1880s, the town had become cosmopolitan, for its population then included Spaniards, Tagalogs, Cebuanos, Leyteños, Samareños, Ilocanos, and others in addition to Camigueños and Boholanos. By the virtue of Act No. 951, issued by the Philippine Commission on October 21, 1903, which reduced the number of municipalities in the then-undivided Misamis (Camiguin's mother province) from 24 to 10, Catarman, Sagay, and Mahinog became part of Mambajao. In 1942, the Japanese forces landed in the town of Mambajao. On November 19, 2018, the old municipal hall of Mambajao was destroyed by a fire after it was spread to its second floor. In the 19th Congress of the Philippines, house bills were filed by various representatives which seeks Mambajao including other capital towns of provinces with no current component cities, independent component cities or highly urbanized cities to automatically convert into cities. Mambajao is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.
