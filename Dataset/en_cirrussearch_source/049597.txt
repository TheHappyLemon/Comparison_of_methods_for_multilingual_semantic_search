Milan Škriniar (born 11 February 1995) is a Slovak professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Slovakia national team. Škriniar began his career in his native Slovakia with Žilina. He also underwent a loan spell at ViOn Zlaté Moravce early in his career. In 2016, Škriniar moved to Italy with Sampdoria, where he would play for a season before joining league rivals Internazionale. Škriniar went on to win one Serie A, two Coppa Italia, and two Supercoppa Italiana titles for the Nerazzurri, eventually becoming the team's captain. He joined French club Paris Saint-Germain in 2023. As a youth international, Škriniar represented Slovakia at under-17, under-18, under-19, and under-21 level. In May 2016, at the age of 21, he made his senior Slovakia debut, and was selected for the team representing his country at UEFA Euro 2016. Škriniar later played for Slovakia at Euro 2020. Škriniar began his career in the youth structures of Žiar nad Hronom before joining the youth setup of Žilina at 12 years old. He made his official Slovak Super Liga debut for the first team on 27 March 2012 aged 17 years and 49 days, in a match against ViOn Zlaté Moravce. On 23 November 2012, he scored his first goal in the Slovak Super Liga against ViOn during a 4–1 victory. Škriniar was sent on loan for half a season to ViOn Zlaté Moravce in February 2013 to gain more first-team experience. On 29 January 2016, Sampdoria announced the signing of Milan Škriniar on a four-and-half year contract. He made his debut in a 2–1 home victory over Lazio in late April. During the next season Škriniar played a key role for Marco Giampaolo's Blucerchiati, finishing the campaign as the youngest defender to have made at least 35 appearances in Serie A. On 7 July 2017, Škriniar completed a transfer to fellow Serie A side Inter Milan signing a five-year contract. The club paid a reported fee around €20 million and also included the striker Gianluca Caprari. The transfer made Škriniar the most expensive Slovak player of all time. He was presented four days later and received squad number 37, stating: "It's amazing to think that in 18 months I've gone from the Slovakian league to playing for a club like Inter." Škriniar made his competitive debut for the club on 20 August in the opening matchday of 2017–18 Serie A against Fiorentina as Inter won 3–0 at San Siro. He scored his first Serie A goal later on 16 September against Crotone, the opener in the 82nd minute with a right-footed shot in an eventual 2–0 away win to keep Inter's winning streak. His second of the campaign came in matchday 10 against his former side Sampdoria on 24 October, netting again the opener as Inter won 3–2. Škriniar was distinguished for his performances in the first part of the season, being one of the best players of the squad. He continued with his great performances even in the second part of the season, which proved clinical for the team, which returned to UEFA Champions League after six years. In the 2018–19 season, Škriniar made his debut in the UEFA Champions League on 18 September in the opening group stage match against Tottenham Hotspur, playing full-90 minutes in a 2–1 comeback win at San Siro. On 2 November 2019, in a Serie A match against Bologna which ended in a 2–1 away win, Škriniar made his 100th appearance in all competitions for Inter, all of them as starter. On 3 November 2021, Škriniar scored his first UEFA Champions League goal in a 3–1 away win against Sheriff Tiraspol. In an interview with Slovak outlet Futbolsfz.sk on 29 January 2023, Škriniar confirmed that he had signed a pre-contract agreement with Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain. Negotiations took place between Inter Milan and PSG to transfer Škriniar during the January transfer window, but they eventually broke down. He was subsequently stripped of the captaincy by manager Simone Inzaghi. In February, Škriniar suffered a lower back injury, which was later revealed to be a lumbar vertebra fracture. He underwent surgery for the fracture in April, missing the quarter-finals and semi-finals of the Champions League. In the 2023 UEFA Champions League final on 10 June, Škriniar was left on the bench as Inter was defeated 1–0 by Manchester City. On 30 June 2023, Inter Milan announced the departure of Škriniar as a free agent at the end of 2022–23 season, after six years with the club. On 6 July 2023, Paris Saint-Germain officially confirmed that Škriniar had joined the club, signing a five-year contract until 30 June 2028. He became the first Slovak to play for the club. Škriniar made his debut in a 0–0 league draw against Lorient at the Parc des Princes on 12 August. On 7 November 2023, Škriniar scored his first goal for PSG in a 2–1 loss against AC Milan in the group stage of the Champions League. Škriniar represented various Slovak youth teams, and made his debut for the Slovakia senior squad in a friendly 3–1 win over Georgia on 27 May 2016. He was selected as part of the Slovakia squad for Euro 2016. After the international retirement of Ján Ďurica in November 2017, Škriniar took his place as a centre-back partner to Martin Škrtel in the national team, even directing Slovak defence in Škrtel's absences (for example in a double fixture against Netherlands and Morocco despite his relatively young age, compared to experienced side-backs Peter Pekarík and Tomáš Hubočan). Following the international retirement of national team captain Marek Hamšík, Škriniar was appointed the captain of the team in June 2022. National team coach Štefan Tarkovič highlighted Škriniar's leadership qualities during the announcement. Škriniar has been described as a defender who is "a strong tackler who is quick to make clearances". A natural centre-back, he can also be deployed as a defensive midfielder where he also produced outstanding performances with under-21 side. His former youth manager said of him: He [Škriniar] has always been the leader on and off the pitch. He has been described in the media as the successor to former Liverpool icon Martin Škrtel in Slovakia's defensive line. He has also drawn praise from several Italian pundits for his positional sense, as well as his ability in the air, and in one on one situations. French newspaper L'Équipe has highlighted Škriniar's high pass and long pass accuracy, his complexity and low injury proneness and imposing figure. Škriniar has been in a relationship with model Barbora Hrončeková since 2014. Their daughter Charlotte was born in 2020. They married in July 2023.
