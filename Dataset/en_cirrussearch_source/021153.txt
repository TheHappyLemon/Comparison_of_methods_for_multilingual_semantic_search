Peter V (Portuguese: Pedro V Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈpeðɾu]; 16 September 1837 – 11 November 1861), nicknamed "the Hopeful" (Portuguese: o Esperançoso), was King of Portugal from 1853 to 1861. As the eldest son of Queen Maria II and King Ferdinand II, Peter was a member of the House of Bragança. As heir apparent to the throne he was styled Prince Royal (Portuguese: Príncipe Real), and was also the 23rd Duke of Braganza (Duque de Bragança). Peter was a conscientious and hard-working monarch who, under the guidance of his father, sought radical modernisation of the Portuguese state and infrastructure. Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the cholera outbreak of 1853–1856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro V, along with his brothers Fernando and João and other royal family members, died of typhoid fever or cholera in 1861. Peter married Princess Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, eldest daughter of Karl Anton, Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, and Princess Josephine of Baden, by proxy in Berlin on 29 April 1858 and then in person in Lisbon on 18 May 1858. It was a happy marriage until Queen Stephanie died a year later from diphtheria. As Peter and Stephanie's marriage was childless, the Portuguese throne passed to his brother Luís.
