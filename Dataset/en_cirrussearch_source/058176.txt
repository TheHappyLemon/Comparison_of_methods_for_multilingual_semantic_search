The 2032 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXXV Olympiad and also known as Brisbane 2032 is an upcoming international multi-sport event scheduled to take place between 23 July to 8 August 2032, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Following changes in the bidding rules, the International Olympic Committee selected and announced Brisbane as the winning bid on 21 July 2021, two days before the start of the 2020 Summer Olympics. Brisbane was first announced as the preferred bid on 24 February 2021, gaining the formal approval of the IOC Executive Board on 10 June 2021. Brisbane became the first host city to be selected to host the Olympics through the new bid process. It will be the third Summer Games to be held in Australia after the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Victoria and the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, New South Wales. It will also be the fourth Summer Games to be held in the Southern Hemisphere, after the aforementioned games in Australia and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, Brazil. This will also be the second Summer Games to be held entirely in a host country's meteorological winter, after Rio. The new IOC bidding process was approved at the 134th IOC Session on 24 June 2019 in Lausanne, Switzerland. The key proposals, driven by the relevant recommendations from Olympic Agenda 2020, are: Establish a permanent, ongoing dialogue to explore and create interest among cities/regions/countries and National Olympic Committees for any Olympic event Create two Future Host Commissions (Summer and Winter Games) to oversee interest in future Olympic events and report to the IOC executive board Give the IOC Session more influence by having non-executive board members form part of the Future Host Commissions. The IOC also modified the Olympic Charter to increase its flexibility by removing the date of election from 7 years before the games and changing the host from a single city/region/country to multiple cities, regions, or countries. The change in the bidding process was criticised by members of the German bid as "incomprehensible" and hard to surpass "in terms of non-transparency". The full composition of the Summer Commissions, oversee interested hosts, or with potential hosts where the IOC may want to create interest, is as follows: According to Future Host Commission terms of reference with rules of conduct, the new IOC bidding system is divided into two dialogue stages: Continuous Dialogue: Non-committal discussions between the IOC and Interested Parties (City/Region/Country/NOC interested in hosting) concerning hosting future Olympic events. Targeted Dialogue: Targeted discussions with one or more Interested Parties (called Preferred Host(s)), as instructed by the IOC Executive Board. This follows a recommendation by the Future Host Commission as a result of Continuous Dialogue. Brisbane was confirmed as host of the 2032 Summer Olympics at the 138th IOC Session on 21 July 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. As per the new format of choosing future Olympic Games host cities from the IOC's Agenda 2020, the vote was in a form of a referendum to the 80 IOC delegates. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 72 of the delegates voted "Yes", 5 voted "No" and 3 other voters abstained. Brisbane Organising Committee for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games was established by the Queensland Government in 2021 to plan, organise and deliver the Olympic and Paralympic Games in accordance with the host contract. From the 2021 selection of the city as the host for the 2032 Summer Olympics, Brisbane has 11 years to prepare for the games. The Brisbane bid relied on the premise that over 80 percent of the venues needed to host the games were already existing infrastructure. A 2019 feasibility study suggested that over A$900 million would be needed from both state and federal funding to host the games. The bid received federal government support in 2019.[citation needed] The majority of venues for the Games are existing or undergoing renovations and upgrades. Most of the new venues would be situated in the Brisbane Zone, such as the planned Brisbane Live precinct, located at Roma Street. The Brisbane Live precinct will house a 17–18,000 person arena as its centrepiece and will be used for events such as aquatics. The precinct will also include a new railway station under Roma Street. The precinct construction cost is around AUD$2 billion, with an estimated completion date of 2024. In April 2021, Premier of Queensland Annastacia Palaszczuk stated that Brisbane Cricket Ground (colloquially known as "the Gabba") would undergo an approximately $1 billion redevelopment to serve as the main stadium if Brisbane were awarded the Games, under which the stadium will be "entirely demolished" and rebuilt to a capacity of 50,000. A new pedestrian plaza would also be constructed, which has been proposed as a site for public festivities during the Games. In September 2021, Ted O'Brien—LNP of Queensland MP and newly-appointed special envoy for Brisbane 2032—argued that the redevelopment was announced without consultation, explaining that "the problem was we were selling a proposition to the International Olympic Committee about the 'new norms'; no big, new, flashy, glossy investments", and that "we had a lot of work to claw back with the IOC to make sure they didn't think we were telling them one thing and planning to do something else." In February 2023, the state and federal government reached an agreement on $7 billion worth of redevelopment in Brisbane for the Games, led by the aforementioned Gabba redevelopment (whose cost was increased to $2.7 billion, paid entirely by the state) and Brisbane Live. The historic East Brisbane State School would be demolished and relocated due to the Gabba project. In August 2023, the project began to face questions about its cost, especially after Victoria withdrew its hosting of the 2026 Commonwealth Games due to cost concerns; Matt Carroll of the Australian Olympic Committee told a senate committee that the IOC recommends against building infrastructure solely for the Olympics, and that the Gabba's existing tenants (including Cricket Australia and the Brisbane Lions of the AFL) would remain the stadium's "primary use" after its completion. In December 2023, Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner withdrew his support for the Gabba project, stating that Brisbane 2032 had "become more about overpriced stadiums rather than the promise of vital transport solutions." Queensland had announced plans for a 20,000-seat stadium at the Brisbane Showgrounds at a cost of $137 million, with the intent to use it as a temporary venue for the Gabba's tenants while it is being reconstructed. Schrinner, who was not given advance notice of the Showgrounds project, stated that "the state government's ham-fisted and foolish attempt to extort Brisbane ratepayers for tens of millions of dollars for a new RNA stadium was the final straw." The new Premier of Queensland Steven Miles (who took office unopposed after Palaszczuk retired from politics) announced that he would instate an infrastructure authority to oversee the development of Brisbane 2032's venues, and that an independent review of its plans would be led by former Lord Mayor Graham Quirk and completed within the next 60 days. In January 2024, Miles stated that despite his previous support of the stadium plans as an assistant minister, he was concerned over the $2.7 billion cost of the stadium project, and that "I repeatedly asked if there were any other options, and all the options that were brought back cost similar amounts for a worse outcome." On 18 March 2024, as a result of the independent review, Miles announced that the Gabba project had been cancelled. It will still undergo a refurbishment ahead of the Games, but will no longer serve as the ceremonies and athletics venue. The review recommended the construction of a new stadium in Victoria Park as a legacy project, but Miles stated that this proposal has been rejected due to its projected $3.4 billion cost. Instead, Miles announced that Lang Park (which is already scheduled to host rugby sevens and football) would serve as the ceremonies venue instead, and Queensland Sports and Athletics Centre would host athletics. Both venues will undergo upgrades ahead of the Games. The Brisbane Live arena would also be relocated to the Roma Street Parkland (rather than above the Roma Street railway station, while the Breakfast Creek Indoor Sports Precinct and Toowoomba Sports Ground projects were also scrapped. Miles stated that he wanted Brisbane 2032 to be a "low-cost Games", and that "when Queenslanders are struggling with housing and other costs, I cannot justify to them spending $3.4 billion on a new stadium." As of 2021, Brisbane has many infrastructure projects under construction or planning on top of the games. The Cross River Rail, scheduled to be completed in 2024, is an underground railway project through central Brisbane, which is under construction. Cross River Rail will see the development of a new rail line underneath Brisbane River, and the redevelopment of several stations in the Brisbane central business district with a cost of over A$6 billion. Other transport infrastructure projects include the Brisbane Metro bus rapid transit project that comprises two routes with a headway of up to five minutes during peak times. The project is scheduled to be completed in late 2024. Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner proposed that a 7-hectare (17-acre) glass factory at 137 Montague Rd, South Brisbane, be redeveloped into a 57,000 m2 (613,500 sq ft) International Broadcasting Centre along the banks of the Brisbane River. The main Athletes' Village will be constructed at Hamilton. Venues will be located in three zones in South East Queensland: Brisbane as the main host city, and neighbouring areas Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. Another five cities will host football preliminaries: Cairns, Toowoomba and Townsville in the state of Queensland. Melbourne and Sydney — Australia's two previous host cities in 1956 and 2000, respectively—will also host football preliminaries. Lang Park will serve as the ceremonies venue, replacing a scrapped plan to reconstruct the Brisbane Cricket Ground. The program of the Summer Olympics consists of mandatory "core" sports that persist between Games and up to six optional sports: optional sports are proposed by the organizing committee in order to improve local interest, provided that the total number of participants does not exceed 10,500 athletes. Various sanctioning bodies have announced plans to pursue bids for sports to be added to the 2032 Summer Olympics: In February 2021, Softball Australia, Baseball Australia and the World Baseball Softball Confederation backed baseball/softball to be part of the 2028 and 2032 programs. CEO of Baseball Australia Glenn Williams noted record broadcasting audiences for baseball and softball at the 2020 Summer Olympics, with Softball Australia chair Richard Lindell also supporting the sports' reinstatement into the core Olympic program. Both disciplines have medalled for Australia at the Olympics and a baseball-specific site at the proposed Breakfast Creek Sports Precinct in Albion would bolster their bid. Baseball/softball was selected by the Los Angeles 2028 organising committee for inclusion in its programme. In July 2021, International Rugby League (IRL) chair Troy Grant stated that pursuing rugby league for Queensland 2032 was a "priority" for the organisation, with a particular focus on rugby league nines for the Olympics and wheelchair rugby league for the Paralympics. In August 2021, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the establishment of a working group to pursue cricket for the Los Angeles 2028 and/or Brisbane 2032 Summer Olympics, including representatives from USA Cricket, the Asian Cricket Council, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), and Zimbabwe Cricket. The bid has also received backing from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Cricket is one of the most popular sports in Australia, and Cricket Australia is one of the 12 full members of the ICC. Cricket was selected by the Los Angeles 2028 organising committee for inclusion in its programme. In August 2021, World Netball announced that it would pursue the inclusion of netball, with backing from Netball Australia. The country has won the Netball World Cup eleven times since its inception. The bid faces a potential obstacle from the IOC's current policy of gender parity: men's netball does not receive the same level of public attention as the women's game. Domestically, the Games will be televised by the Nine Network, which acquired the rights to the Olympics from 2024 through 2032 in a deal announced 8 February 2023. These Games mark the final year of nearly all of the IOC's current long-term broadcasting contracts.
