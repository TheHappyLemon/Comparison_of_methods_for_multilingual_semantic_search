The 1969–70 European Cup was the 15th season of the European Cup, a club football tournament organised by UEFA for the domestic league champions of its member associations. It was won by Feyenoord of the Netherlands, who beat Scottish club Celtic after extra time in the final at San Siro in Milan on 6 May 1970. It was the first time the title had been won by a club from the Netherlands, and sparked a period of Dutch dominance in the competition, as Ajax won the next three titles. For the first time in the European Cup, tiebreaker playoffs were abandoned in favour of the away goals rule; if both teams had scored the same number of away goals, one side was eliminated by the toss of a coin, something that was required in two of the matches (marked on the table below by "c/t"). Milan were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Eventual Champions Feyenoord in the second round. 21 August 1969 Kupittaan jalkapallostadion, Turku Attendance: 3,180 Referee: Tofik Bakhramov (Soviet Union) 28 August 1969 Københavns Idrætspark, Copenhagen Attendance: 3,915 Referee: Bertil Lööw (Sweden) Kjøbenhavns Boldklub won 5–0 on aggregate. 17 September 1969 Empire Stadium, Gżira Attendance: 8,675 Referee: Aurelio Angonese (Italy) 17 September 1969 Mithat Paşa Stadyumu, Istanbul Attendance: 12,300 Referee: Andrei Rădulescu (Romania) 17 September 1969 Francisc von Neumann Stadium, Arad Attendance: 12,781 Referee: Paul Schiller (Austria) 17 September 1969 Grünwalder Stadion, Munich Attendance: 38,275 Referee: Jim Finney (England) 17 September 1969 Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion, Berlin Attendance: 11,022 Referee: John Adair (Northern Ireland) 17 September 1969 Stadion Crvena Zvezda, Belgrade Attendance: 7,464 Referee: Michalakis Kiriakides (Cyprus) 10 September 1969 San Siro, Milan Attendance: 46,569 Referee: Goncho Rusev (Bulgaria) 17 September 1969 Feijenoord Stadion, Rotterdam Attendance: 54,656 Referee: John Carpenter (Republic of Ireland) 17 September 1969 Stade Maurice Dufrasne, Liège Attendance: 16,837 Referee: Arthur Lentini (Malta) 24 September 1969 Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid Attendance: 18,419 Referee: Aurel Bentu (Romania) 17 September 1969 Elland Road, Leeds Attendance: 25,979 Referee: Bohumil Smejkal (Czechoslovakia) 17 September 1969 Narodna Army Stadium, Sofia Attendance: 22,615 Referee: Alfred Ott (West Germany) 17 September 1969 St. Jakob Stadium, Basel Attendance: 37,587 Referee: Rudolf Glöckner (East Germany) 17 September 1969 Estádio da Luz, Lisbon Attendance: 35,928 Referee: Robert Héliès (France) 17 September 1969 20:15 Praterstadion, Vienna Attendance: 60,746 Referee: Roger Mâchin (France) 17 September 1969 Stadio Comunale, Florence Attendance: 36,840 Referee: Ertuğrul Dilek (Turkey) 1 October 1969 Spartak Stadium, Trnava Attendance: 9,612 Referee: Milivoje Gugulović (Yugoslavia) Spartak Trnava won 6–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 Lansdowne Road, Dublin Attendance: 8,972 Referee: Kåre Sirevaag (Norway) Galatasaray won 5–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 Stadion Wojska Polskiego, Warsaw Attendance: 7,665 Referee: Reino Koskinen (Finland) Legia Warsaw won 10–1 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Étienne Attendance: 33,716 Referee: Josef Krnávek (Czechoslovakia) Saint-Étienne won 3–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 Leoforos Alexandras Stadium, Athens Attendance: 22,042 Referee: José María Ortiz de Mendíbil (Spain) Vorwärts Berlin won 3–1 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 Windsor Park, Belfast Attendance: 3,278 Referee: Kaj Rasmussen (Denmark) Red Star Belgrade won 12–2 on aggregate. 24 September 1969 Municipal Stadium, Luxembourg Attendance: 10,454 Referee: Stanisław Eksztajn (Poland) Milan won 8–0 on aggregate. 30 September 1969 Feijenoord Stadion, Rotterdam Attendance: 37,917 Referee: Johan Einar Boström (Sweden) Feyenoord won 16–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 Qemal Stafa Stadium, Tirana Attendance: 22,010 Referee: Gerhard Schulenburg (West Germany) Standard Liège won 4–1 on aggregate. 30 September 1969 Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid Attendance: 14,420 Referee: Corneliu Niţescu (Romania) Real Madrid won 14–1 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 Ullevaal Stadion, Oslo Attendance: 7,595 Referee: Antoine Queudeville (Luxembourg) Leeds United won 16–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 Népstadion, Budapest Attendance: 24,015 Referee: William Mullen (Scotland) Ferencváros won 5–3 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 Celtic Park, Glasgow Attendance: 49,976 Referee: Gyula Emsberger (Hungary) Celtic won 2–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 Københavns Idrætspark, Copenhagen Attendance: 31,528 Referee: Ronald Jones (Wales) Benfica won 5–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 19:00 Central Stadium, Kyiv Attendance: 75,206 Referee: Lado Jakše (Yugoslavia) Dynamo Kyiv won 5–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1969 Värendsvallen, Växjö Attendance: 13,612 Referee: Arie van Gemert (Netherlands) Fiorentina won 3–1 on aggregate. 12 November 1969 Spartak Stadium, Trnava Attendance: 11,202 Referee: William Mullen (Scotland) 12 November 1969 Stadion Wojska Polskiego, Warsaw Attendance: 11,647 Referee: Vital Loraux (Belgium) 12 November 1969 Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, Berlin Attendance: 7,000 Referee: Thomas Wharton (Scotland) 12 November 1969 San Siro, Milan Attendance: 17,037 Referee: Hans-Joachim Weyland (West Germany) 19 November 1969 Stade Maurice Dufrasne, Liège Attendance: 34,310 Referee: Eric Jennings (England) 12 November 1969 Elland Road, Leeds Attendance: 37,291 Referee: Tofik Bakhramov (Soviet Union) 12 November 1969 Celtic Park, Glasgow Attendance: 74,894 Referee: Concetto Lo Bello (Italy) 12 November 1969 19:00 Central Stadium, Kyiv Attendance: 84,238 Referee: Johan Einar Boström (Sweden) 26 November 1969 Mithat Paşa Stadyumu, Istanbul Attendance: 25,879 Referee: Gaspar Pintado Viu (Spain) 1–1 on aggregate;
