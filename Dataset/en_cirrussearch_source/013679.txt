Note: Not to be confused with the Austro-Hungarian Aviatik B.II series 32, 32.7 and 34 which were different aircraft. The Aviatik B.II was a reconnaissance aircraft built in Germany during World War I. The (German) Aviatik B.II was a two-seat biplane of conventional configuration that seated its pilot and observer in tandem, open cockpits. Compared to its predecessor, the B.I, the B.II had a more powerful engine and revised nose design that faired the powerplant in more neatly, and a single "rhino horn" collector stack for the exhaust. A variety of two- and three-bay wing designs were utilised during production. While originally no armament was fitted (in common with other B- class aircraft), later production versions received a machine gun for the observer. All were withdrawn from front line service by early 1916, however the type continued in use as a trainer for a time with advanced flying training units (it is known that the B.II served in this role at FEA 9 at Darmstadt during 1916).  German Empire Luftstreitkrafte Data from General characteristics Crew: 2 Length: 7.1 m (23 ft 4 in) Wingspan: 12.35 m (40 ft 6 in) Height: 3.15 m (10 ft 4 in) Gross weight: 1,071 kg (2,361 lb) Powerplant: 1 × Mercedes D.II 6-cylinder water-cooled in-line piston engine, 89 kW (120 hp) Propellers: 2-bladed fixed-pitch propeller Performance Maximum speed: 100 km/h (62 mph, 54 kn) Endurance: 4 hours Service ceiling: 6,100 m (20,000 ft) Grosz, Peter M.; Haddow, George; Scheiner, Peter (2002) [1993].
