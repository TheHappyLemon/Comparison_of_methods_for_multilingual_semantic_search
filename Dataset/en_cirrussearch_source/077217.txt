The 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the tenth edition of the CONCACAF Gold Cup competition, and the twentieth soccer championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF). It was played from July 3 to 26, 2009 in the United States. This competition was the fourth tournament without guests from other confederations. Mexico won their fifth Gold Cup, and eighth CONCACAF Championship overall, after beating the United States 5–0 in the final. It was the second consecutive Gold Cup final and fourth overall to feature Mexico and the United States and the third won by Mexico. The set of thirteen venues—the largest number ever used to stage the Gold Cup—was announced on March 9. A total of 12 teams qualified for the tournament. Three berths were allocated to North America, five to Central America, and four to the Caribbean. Notes: Cuba finished fourth at the Caribbean Championship, but withdrew from the Gold Cup due to issues related to player development and the ability to field a competitive team. Haiti and Trinidad and Tobago, 3rd place in Group I and Group J, respectively, as the two highest finishing teams in the Caribbean Championship not already qualified for the Gold Cup, were placed in a draw by the CFU to determine who would replace Cuba, and Haiti won the draw. Participating teams selected a squad of 23 players (including three goalkeepers), except the United States, who were given an expanded 30-player roster due to their participation in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. The twelve teams that qualified were divided into three groups. The draw for the Group Stage was announced on April 2, 2009. The top two teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage along with the best two of the third-place teams, filling out the knockout field of eight.
