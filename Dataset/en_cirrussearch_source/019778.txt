In the past it was a major crossroad in the heart of Moravia in the Czech Republic. The historic city centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone. Přerov is made up of 13 city parts and villages: Přerov I-Město Přerov II-Předmostí Přerov III-Lověšice Přerov IV-Kozlovice Přerov V-Dluhonice Přerov VI-Újezdec Přerov VII-Čekyně Přerov VIII-Henčlov Přerov IX-Lýsky Přerov X-Popovice Přerov XI-Vinary Přerov XII-Žeravice Přerov XIII-Penčice The name Přerov is of Old Slavic origin. It meant 'ditch', 'pool', 'swamp', or 'stagnant water'. Přerov is located about 19 kilometres (12 mi) southeast of Olomouc. The eastern part of the municipal territory lies in the Moravian Gate lowlands, the western part lies in the Upper Morava Valley. A small northern part extends into the Nízký Jeseník range. The highest point is the hill Čekyňský kopec at 307 m (1,007 ft) above sea level. The Bečva River flows through the city. Settlement in the locality dates back to prehistoric times. A locality called Skalka in Předmostí city part is known worldwide for its rich archaeological discoveries dating mainly from the Paleolithic period. Discoveries include excavations of a large number of mammoth bones, sites of mammoth hunters' camps from 27–26 thousand years ago, and others. Together with Dolní Věstonice it is the most important archaeological site in the country. The first written mention of Přerov is in a deed of bishop Jindřich Zdík from 1141 and testifies to Přerov's administrative function in the castle system of the Přemyslid state. King Ottokar II of Bohemia gave Přerov the privilege of being a royal town in 1256. An old stone fortress was built here in the first half of the 13th century. It was conquered and damaged during the Hussite Wars. In 1487, Přerov was acquired by the Pernštejn family. Vilém of Pernštejn had rebuilt the Horní Square and the fortress, which became a solid Gothic castle. The hill around the castle was colonized by new settlers, including members of the Unity of the Brethren, thanks to which the town became a centre of culture and education in the 16th century. In the second half of the 16th century, reconstruction of the castle into a Renaissance residence began. In the late 16th century, Přerov was bought by Karel the Elder of Zierotin, who chose the town as his seat. He had finished the reconstruction of the castle. During his rule, the town experienced prosperity. After the Battle of White Mountain, Zierotin was forced to moved away and the town lost its importance. In 1841, the railway to Přerov was built and the town has become an important railway junction. In the second half of the 19th century, there has been rapid economic growth, driven primarily by the production of agricultural machinery. German terror in Bohemia and Moravia peaked in spring 1945, sparking a Czech uprising, which started in Přerov on 1 May and then spread throughout the whole country after the murder of 78,154 Czech Jews and 340,000 Czech citizens during the German occupation. In June 1945, during the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia, 265 Germans (71 men, 120 women and 74 children) were killed in Přerov. On 1 July 2006, the town of Přerov became a statutory city. The main employer based in the city is Meopta, a multinational company manufacturing various products mainly in the field of optics. It was founded in 1933. Other major industrial companies include Precheza (representative of the chemical industry founded in 1894, owned by Agrofert) and DPOV (a subsidiary of České dráhy focused on repairs and modernization of railway rolling stock). Přerov is known for the Zubr Brewery. The brewery was founded in 1872. The city is a major railway junction with main lines to Prague via Olomouc, Warsaw via Ostrava, and Vienna via Břeclav, and a regional line to Brno. A public domestic and private international airport is located in Přerov. It was established in 2013 by transformation from original military airport Přerov–Bochoř.
