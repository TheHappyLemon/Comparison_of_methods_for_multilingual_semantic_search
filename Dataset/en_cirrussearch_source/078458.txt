The Arockalypse is the third studio album by Finnish rock band Lordi. It includes the hit single "Hard Rock Hallelujah", which won the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 for Finland. The album has sold triple platinum in Finland and gold in Sweden. Although the album cover shows OX, it was Kalma who played bass guitar on the album. The Arockalypse has many guest-stars on its tracks: Dee Snider and Jay Jay French from Twisted Sister, Udo Dirkschneider from Accept/U.D.O. and Bruce Kulick from Kiss. Before the album was released in Finland, there were rumours about other possible guest stars, including Sebastian Bach from Skid Row, Alice Cooper, King Diamond, Rob Zombie, and other members of Kiss, the latter being Lordi's greatest influence. In reality, only Sebastian Bach and Alice Cooper were ever asked to be guests on the album, but neither were able to make it.[citation needed] "SCG3 Special Report" (with Starbuck as The News Reporter, Sam Romero and Dee Snider as "the monster squad's spokesman") – 3:46 (Mr Lordi/Kita) "Bringing Back the Balls to Rock" – 3:31 (Mr Lordi) "The Deadite Girls Gone Wild" – 3:45 (Mr Lordi/Kita/Tracy Lipp) "The Kids Who Wanna Play with the Dead" – 4:07 (Mr Lordi) "It Snows in Hell" (feat.
