Moghbeli attended Baldwin Senior High School in New York. She earned a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering with information technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and played volleyball, lacrosse, and basketball for the MIT Engineers. Moghbeli was commissioned as an officer in the United States Marine Corps in 2005, and trained to become an AH-1 Super Cobra pilot. While in service with the Marine Corps, she deployed overseas three times and completed 150 combat missions. Moghbeli received a master's degree in aerospace engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in California. She attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland, becoming a helicopter test pilot with VMX-1 at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona.

In June 2017, Moghbeli was selected as a member of NASA Astronaut Group 22, and subsequently began her two-year training. In January 2020, she graduated alongside 13 others in the NASA Astronaut Candidate Training Program, officially making her "eligible for spaceflight, including assignments to the International Space Station, Artemis missions to the Moon, and ultimately, missions to Mars." In March 2022, she was assigned as commander of the SpaceX Crew-7 mission to the International Space Station. The mission, her first flight in space, launched to the Space Station on August 26, 2023.

She still celebrates Nowruz (Persian New Year). Space exploration was an aspiration for Moghbeli as a child. During school, she wrote a sixth-grade book report on the first woman in space, Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova.
