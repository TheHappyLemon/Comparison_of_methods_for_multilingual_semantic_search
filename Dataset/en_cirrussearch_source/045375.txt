Gołdap County (Polish: powiat gołdapski) is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, northern Poland, on the border with Russia. Its administrative seat and only town is Gołdap, which lies 133 kilometres (83 mi) north-east of the regional capital Olsztyn. When powiats were re-introduced in the Polish local government reforms of 1999, the present Gołdap and Olecko Counties made up a single entity (called powiat olecko-gołdapski or Olecko-Gołdap County). This was divided into two in 2002. The county covers an area of 771.93 square kilometres (298.0 sq mi). As of 2019 its total population is 26,825, out of which the population of Gołdap is 13,716 and the rural population is 13,109. Gołdap County is bordered by Suwałki County to the east, Olecko County to the south, Giżycko County to the south-west and Węgorzewo County to the west. It also borders Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast) to the north. The county is subdivided into three gminas (one urban-rural and two rural).
