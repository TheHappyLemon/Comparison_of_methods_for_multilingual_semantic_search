Dubrowna or Dubrovno (Belarusian: Дуброўна, romanized: Dubroŭna; Russian: Дубровно; Polish: Dąbrowna) is a town in Vitebsk Region, northern Belarus. It is located on the Dnieper River and serves as the administrative centre of Dubrowna District. As of 2023, it has a population of 6,909. The toponym originates from a Proto-Slavic term for an oak forest, which may explain the inclusion of oak leaves and acorns in the town's coat of arms. In the 19th century Dubrowna was a centre for weaving. The town had a significant Jewish community that in 1898 formed more than half of its population. During World War II Dubrovno was heavily affected. It was occupied by German forces July 17–20, 1941, and the town's Jews were killed. It was the scene of considerable partisan activity. From October 1943 to June 1944 it was at or near the front line, and was not finally reoccupied by Soviet forces until June 26, 1944. Dubrowna hosts an annual folk song and dance festival, "Dnepr voices in Dubrovno".
