At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Traianus and Maximus (or, less frequently, year 856 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 103 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Emperor Trajan and Manius Laberius Maximus become Roman consuls. Pliny the Younger becomes a member of the college of Augurs (103–104). Legio X Gemina moves to Vienna, where it remains until the 5th century. In Palmyra, Syria, a Temple of the Sun is erected to the god Baal.
