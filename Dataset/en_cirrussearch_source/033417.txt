The 5th Chess Olympiad, organized by the FIDE and comprising an open and (unofficial) women's tournament, as well as several events designed to promote the game of chess, took place between July 12 and July 23, 1933, in Folkestone, United Kingdom. The 4th Women's World Chess Championship also took place during the Olympiad. The English team still went under the name of Great Britain, even though it only consisted of English players and Scotland participated with their own team. Estonia was supposed to participate, but the team never showed up. Although commonly referred to as the men's division, this section is open to both male and female players. 5th Chess Olympiad: Folkestone 1933 OlimpBase
