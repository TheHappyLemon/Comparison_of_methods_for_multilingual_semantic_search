Eric Samuel André (born April 4, 1983) is an American comedian, actor, TV show host, writer, producer, and musician. He is best known as the creator, host, and co-writer of the Adult Swim surreal comedy series The Eric Andre Show (2012–present). His other notable roles include Mike on the FXX comedy series Man Seeking Woman (2015–2017) and the voice of Azizi in the remake of The Lion King (2019). He also performs music under the stage name Blarf. Eric Samuel André was born in Boca Raton, Florida, on April 4, 1983. His mother is an American of Ashkenazi Jewish descent from New York's Upper West Side, and his father was an Afro-Haitian immigrant who worked as a psychiatrist. He identifies as both Black and Jewish. In 2001, after graduating from Dreyfoos School of the Arts in West Palm Beach, Florida, he studied at Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he played the double bass and graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Music degree. André began his comedy career in 2003. He is the creator and host of The Eric Andre Show, a parody of public access talk shows, on Cartoon Network's late night programming block Adult Swim. The show features pranks, shock humor, sketches, and celebrity interviews. He co-starred as Mark on the ABC comedy series Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, and guest-starred on 2 Broke Girls as Deke, Max's love interest and fellow pastry student. He played Mike in the FXX comedy series Man Seeking Woman, which premiered in 2015. The show's third and final season, consisting of ten episodes, ran in early 2017. He voices Luci in the Netflix animated show Disenchantment. His first standup special on Netflix, Legalize Everything, was released on June 23, 2020. In 2021, he created and starred in the Netflix prank comedy film Bad Trip. André dated actress Rosario Dawson from 2016 to 2017. In March 2021, he said that he was in a relationship with a woman he had met at a farmer's market who did not know he was well-known until after they started dating. André is a self-described agnostic atheist and a practitioner of Transcendental Meditation. When addressing his views on sexuality in a 2016 interview, he said, "I think everyone is bi, right? There's no such thing as sexual orientation, or race, or gender. Those are all obsolete man-made concepts. I'll say it again, a hole is a hole." He was then asked if he was coming out as bisexual, to which he responded, "I'll fuck anything that moves." He endorsed Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential election. In October 2022, André and fellow comedian Clayton English filed a federal lawsuit against Clayton County, Georgia, claiming that they were subjected to a police program that racially profiled, coerced, and illegally searched passengers boarding planes for drugs at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport without reasonable suspicion. Their lawsuit challenged the constitutionality of the program. Loudwire. "Eric Andre - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?". YouTube. Valys, Phillip. "Eric Andre's comedic anarchy".
