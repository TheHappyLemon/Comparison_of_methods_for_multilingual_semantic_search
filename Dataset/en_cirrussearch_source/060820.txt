Margarita Xhepa (born 2 April 1932; Aromanian: Margarita Gepa) is an Albanian actress, best known as one of the great ladies of Albanian cinema and theater. She continues to play in recent films such as such as portraying Firdus in 'Bolero në vilën e pleqve,' based on the novel of the same title by Fatos Kongoli. Xhepa is of Aromanian ethnicity. She was born in Lushnjë, Albania, as Margarita Prifti to Zoi and Marijë Prifti. Her mother died when Margarita was nine years old. From an early age, she loved Albanian poetry, and her teacher encouraged her to join acting classes. Gëzim Libohova, a well known drama teacher at the time at the cultural institute of Lushnjë, was scouting among local schools for an appropriate match for the role of a young Russian girl in a theatre play. As he saw Xhepa, he immediately chose her due to her blonde hair and blue eyes. The play was so successful it premiered also in Fier and Berat. After finishing elementary school, she applied to the well known Liceu Artistik (School of Arts) in Tirana, in the drama department. She began her career in Tirana, at the National Theatre (Albanian: Teatri Kombëtar). There, she performed in plays by Anton Chekov, Friedrich Schiller, and Nikolai Gogol, and others. She presented the first Festivali i Këngës in 1962. She has been honored with the title of People's Artist of Albania. The actress has been awarded the Actor Of Europe award in the 19th edition of the International Theater Festival. The main award for best acting went to one of the most important actresses in the wider space of Balkan theater, for the role of 'Lady Mother' in the play Who Brought Doruntina, directed by Laert Vasili.
