The water polo tournaments at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro took place from 6 to 20 August at the Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre in Barra da Tijuca. Twenty teams (twelve for men and eight for women) competed in the tournament. Games that ended in ties in elimination rounds were decided by shootouts, as overtime has been abolished since 2013. The competition consisted of two stages; a group stage followed by a knockout stage. The teams were divided into two groups of six countries, playing every team in their group once. Two points were awarded for a victory, one point for a draw. The top four teams per group qualified for the quarterfinals.
