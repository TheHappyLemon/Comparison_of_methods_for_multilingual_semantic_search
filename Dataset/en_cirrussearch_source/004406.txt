Diego Alfredo Lugano Morena (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈdjeɣo luˈɣano]; (born 2 November 1980) is a Uruguayan former professional footballer who played as a central defender. Nicknamed Tota, Lugano played for a number of clubs in South America and Europe, including Plaza Colonia, Club Nacional de Football, São Paulo, Fenerbahçe, Paris Saint-Germain, Malaga and West Bromwich Albion, before finishing his career with a second spell at Brazilian club São Paulo, where he now works as an administrator. Throughout his career, Lugano netted goals in the football leagues of Uruguay, Brazil, Turkey, England, France and Paraguay. In 2015, Paraguayan newspaper ExtraPRESS named Lugano one of the most expensive player in Paraguay, and he was also awarded by Diario Popular as the most popular player in Paraguayan football. Lugano made 95 appearances for the Uruguay national team, captaining his country at two FIFA World Cups. He was named best captain at the 2010 tournament. Born to Alfredo Lugano and Diana Morena in Canelones, Canelones Department, Lugano started playing football for his hometown club Club Atlético Libertad, like his father Alfredo. In December 1998, he played his first match with the first-team squad of Libertad, becoming league champions with the club at the age of 18 years. From Libertad, in 1999, Lugano transferred to Club Nacional de Football in Montevideo. Three years later, Lugano was loaned out to Plaza Colonia for the duration of the playing season. Lugano came to São Paulo FC in 2003. He was contracted by club President Marcelo Portugal Gouveia without consulting the head coach Oswaldo de Oliveira. President Gouveia's actions led to the ascribing of the nickname "Homem do Presidente" ("President's Man") to Lugano. After Oswaldo de Oliveira left the club in late 2003, Lugano started playing matches more frequently. In 2005, he led the team to titles in the Campeonato Paulista, the Copa Libertadores, and the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan. That same year, Lugano was recognized as South America's best defender. His leadership skills and his willingness to fight for ball possession have raised his profile amongst São Paulo's supporters, where he is still highly regarded. Lugano has also mentioned that he still maintains a good relationship with the club. In 2006, he helped his club to the runner-up stage of the Copa Libertadores. Lugano joined Fenerbahçe on 21 August 2006 for a reported transfer fee of €7.5 million, where he signed a 3+1⁄2-year contract with the Turkish club. He and Edu Dracena's powerful defensive abilities helped Fenerbahçe win the league during the club's 100th anniversary year. Lugano is notorious for his presence in attack, as was shown with his scored goals from headers from dead ball situations and support of the forward line. He became a fan favourite with his defensive tenacity and his spectacular play from free kick situations. Following a red card, he was suspended for five weeks after the derby match against Galatasaray during the 2008–09 season when he clashed with Emre Aşık on 12 April 2009 at Ali Sami Yen Stadium. Since then, he has a strong connection with supporters, especially with the Genç Fenerbahçeliler. He was one of the captains of the team. He signed a new four-year contract in 2009 with Fenerbahçe. On 27 August 2011, Fenerbahçe announced Lugano was leaving the club to join Paris Saint-Germain in the French Ligue 1 for a fee worth €3 million. His first season in France, however, ended poorly and Lugano made just 12 appearances, mostly being cut out of the side due to injury and poor form. On 21 January 2013, Lugano signed with Spanish side Málaga CF until 30 June on loan. As he was not in PSG manager Carlo Ancelotti's plans, Lugano was not inscribed in the Champions League for that season; this way, he was not cup tied for his new club and represented Málaga in their European ambitions. He returned to PSG on 1 July 2013, with Málaga failing to make the loan move permanent. On 2 August 2013, Lugano joined Premier League club West Bromwich Albion on a two-year contract. He scored his first goal for West Brom on 20 January 2014, heading in an equalizer in a 1–1 home draw with Everton. On 17 May 2014, West Bromwich announced the release of five players of their squad, including Lugano. On 26 March 2015, Lugano signed for Swedish side BK Häcken on a short-term contract until the summer. Lugano became one of the most merited players ever to play in the Swedish top league. On 7 July 2015, La Nación reported that Primera División Paraguaya team Cerro Porteño had assured the signing of Lugano. On 12 July, Lugano's transfer was officially made. Upon arriving to Paraguay, Lugano was received at the airport by Cerro Porteño managers and fans, and was presented as a Cerro Porteño footballer. He signed a 1-year contract. At the presentation, Lugano pointed "I arrived at Cerro for the need of returning to South America and to be closer to my country. The proposal from Cerro closed everything I wanted, it's a big club, it will demand me and oblige me to return to my level". He was then received by his teammates and began training with the first roster. Lugano revealed that since arriving at Cerro Porteño, he received better offers, but decided to stay. In August 2015, Lugano debuted for Cerro Porteño in a 4–0 victory against General Díaz, scoring the first goal of the game in the first half, scoring with a header. This was his first league goal since January 2014 for West Bromwich Albion. On 13 September 2015, Lugano scored a second half double in a 3–1 home victory against Sol de America.

In December 2015, Lugano was awarded by Diario Popular as the most popular player in Paraguayan football. In January 2016, the club president informed that Lugano was still a Cerro Porteño player and that would speak with him personally if he wanted to leave. Lugano had discarded his trip with the team to Encarnación for the pre-season preparation for the Torneo Apertura. On 5 January 2016, Lugano reached an agreement with Cerro Porteño to leave the club and was available to negotiate a return to Brazilian team São Paulo, who were interested in his services. The termination of the contract came after an interview between Lugano and Juan José Zapag, Cerro Porteño's president. Following Lugano's departure, the club's directives and fans were bothered. Upon his departure from the club, Lugano left a message of grattitude to Cerro Porteño through his social media channel of Facebook. Lugano totalled 5 goals, 10 yellow cards and 1 expulsion in 16 games for Cerro Porteño, amassing 1, 438 minutes. In January 2016, after almost 10 years, Lugano returned to São Paulo FC, in Brazil, where he won 2005 Copa Libertadores and 2005 FIFA Club World Championship, he instantly became São Paulo's idol. On 12 January 2016, he was welcomed at the Guarulhos Airport by nearly 1000 fans of Tricolor paulista. In January 2018, Lugano accepted the role of director of institutional relations at São Paulo, confirming his retirement as a player. Lugano made 95 appearances for the Uruguay national football team after making his debut in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Paraguay.
