Foundation at the University of Regensburg. The topic of his lectures was "Sacralization and Secularization". Hans Joas focuses on social philosophy and sociological theory, especially American pragmatism and historicism; sociology of religion and sociology of war and violence; and changing values in modern society. A particular focus of Joas' research is the emergence of values. To this end, he elaborated a theory of the affirmative genealogy of values, especially of human rights. According to Joas, values emerge in experiences of self-formation and self-transcendence. To this end, he developed a phenomenology of the experience of self-transcendence "from individual prayer to collective ecstasy in archaic rituals or in nationalistic enthusiasm for war"; "it includes moral feelings, the opening of the self in conversation, and in the experience of nature." Joas emphasizes that his consideration of the contingency of the emergence of values should in no way be understood "as a plea against the claims of a universalistic morality." In a three-volume work, Joas attempts to develop the outline of a global history of moral universalism from these premises. In the first volume, published in 2017, "The Power of the Sacred. An Alternative to the Narrative of Disenchantment," he presented a detailed critique of the historical narrative, going back to Max Weber, of a world-historical process of disenchantment that has been advancing since the Hebrew prophets, and a sketch of an alternative to it. In the second volume, published in 2020, "Im Bannkreis der Freiheit. Religionstheorie nach Hegel and Nietzsche", published in 2020  (English translation forthcoming), is concerned in parallel with overcoming the historical image of a history of religion culminating in Protestant Christianity and its constitutive significance for the constitution of modern political freedom, which goes back to Hegel. In portraits of important philosophical, sociological and theological thinkers on religion, the approaches to an alternative are further substantiated. In the third volume currently in progress (working title "Universalismus. Weltherrschaft und Menschheitsethos"), this alternative is being broadly elaborated historically and sociologically. His most recent book (2022), "Warum Kirche? Selbstoptimierung oder Glaubensgemeinschaft" relates the debates about a new understanding of church and about church reform to this history of moral universalism. 2010: Bielefelder Wissenschaftspreis ("Niklas-Luhmann-Preis"). 2012: Werner Heisenberg medal of the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung. 2012: Doctor honoris causa, University of Tübingen. 2013: Doctor honoris causa, Uppsala University. 2013: Hans-Kilian-Award. 2015: Distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award, American Sociological Association, Section History of Sociology. 2015: Max-Planck-Research-Award. 2017: Prix Paul Ricœur. 2018: Recipient of the Theological Award Salzburg. 2022: Recipient of the Distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award of the German Sociological Association. 2022: Doctor honoris causa, Péter-Pázmány-University Budapest.
