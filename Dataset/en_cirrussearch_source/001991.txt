Siple Coast (82°0′S 155°0′W﻿ / ﻿82.000°S 155.000°W﻿ / -82.000; -155.000) is the middle portion of the relatively ill-defined coast along the east side of the Ross Ice Shelf, between the north end of Gould Coast (83°30′S 153°00′W﻿ / ﻿83.500°S 153.000°W﻿ / -83.500; -153.000) and the south end of Shirase Coast (80°10′S 151°00′W﻿ / ﻿80.167°S 151.000°W﻿ / -80.167; -151.000). The area was originally called Kirton Coast, but was renamed by NZ-APC in 1961 after Paul A. Siple, a noted American scientist-explorer who accompanied R. Admiral Richard E. Byrd on all of his Antarctic expeditions. Bindschadler, R.
