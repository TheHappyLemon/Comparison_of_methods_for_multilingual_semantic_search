The ZIS-150 is a Soviet truck. In 1947 it replaced the ZIS-5 truck on the assembly line. Together with the GAZ-51, it was the main Soviet truck during the 1950s, judging by their quantity. A tractor-trailer version of the ZIS-150, the ZIS-120N was sold from 1956 to 1957. In 1957, the base ZIS-150 model was replaced by ZIL-164, which differed outwardly only by vertical grille bars and bumper. ZIS-150 was also manufactured in Braşov, Romania between 1954 and 1960 as the "Steagul Rosu" (Red Flag) SR-101 and in China as the Jiefang CA-10 at First Automobile Works. At least one prototype was built in North Korea under the name "Chollima". Work on a truck that was going to replace the ZIS-5 started in 1945 when it was clear that the war was going to end in favor of the Allied Forces. The first prototype was built some months later, and entered the test stage, however, its engine proved to be rather unreliable, so a newer engine was developed, and another prototype was built in 1946, which passed the prototype stage. The first production batch of these trucks was built in 1947, but mass-production did not start until 1948. Nevertheless, despite production of the ZIS-150 starting, the older ZIS-5 truck was produced until 1956. The ZIS-150 also started getting produced in Georgia, by the KAZ plant. Production of the truck soon started in other Communist countries, such as Romania (under the SR-101 name), in China (under the Jiefang CA-10 name) and a prototype was also built in North Korea under the name Cholima, but did not enter production. In 1956 the ZiS factories were modernized and renamed to ZiL, due to De-Stalinization, and the truck was renamed to ZIL-150. In 1958 the truck's production ended and the model was replaced by the ZIL-164. Production in China continued until 1986. 4x2 4000 kg truck Engine: 90 hp/2400 rpm, 6-cyl, 5555 cc Bore/Stroke: 101.6/114.3 mm Length: 6,720 mm (264.6 in), width: 2,385 mm (93.9 in), height: 2,180 mm (85.8 in) Wheelbase: 4,000 mm (157.5 in), rear axis clearance: 265 mm (10.4 in) Front wheel track: 1,700 mm (66.9 in) Rear track: 1,740 mm (68.5 in) Turning radius on front outer wheel: 8.0 m (26.2 ft) Compression ratio: 6.0 Clutch: twin disk, dry Gearbox: 5 speeds Weight (without load): 3,900 kg (8,598 lb) Maximal speed (loaded, highway): 65 km/h (40 mph) Tyres: 9.00x20 inches Fuel capacity: 150 L (40 US gal; 33 imp gal) Fuel consumption: 29 L/100 km (9.7 mpg‑imp; 8.1 mpg‑US) ZIS-150: Original production version.
