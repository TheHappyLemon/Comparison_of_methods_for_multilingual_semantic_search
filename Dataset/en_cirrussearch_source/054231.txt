A productive loan spell with Wigan Athletic of the Championship saw him promoted to the Chelsea first team upon his return in 2019. He became club captain in 2023. After representing England at various youth levels, James was called up to the full international side for the first time in October 2020, earning his first cap against Wales.

His sister Lauren is also a professional footballer and signed for Chelsea Women in July 2021. Their father Nigel is a football coach. He is of Grenadian descent through his father, and English descent through his mother. Starting his grassroots playing career at Kew Park Rangers and Epsom Eagles, James signed with Chelsea at the age of six, and had a short spell at West London rivals Fulham when he was seven.

On 28 August 2021, James was sent off at the end of the first half of a 1–1 draw against Liverpool due to a handball incident. He scored two goals in the second half of a 3–0 win over Newcastle United at St James' Park on 30 October. At the end of the season James was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award.

He was injured on his first game back, on 27 December 2022, being substituted after 53 minutes. he was ruled out of play for a further four weeks. On 25 April 2023, Chelsea announced that James would miss the rest of the season with a hamstring problem. Following the departure of César Azpilicueta, James was named club captain of Chelsea on 9 August 2023. He suffered a hamstring injury early in the season, which re-occurred in November 2023 after he returned to play. In late December 2023, he had surgery to fix the recurring hamstring injury. James has represented England at youth level from under-18 up to under-21. In May 2017, James was included in the under-20 squad for the 2017 Toulon Tournament. He started in the final as England beat the Ivory Coast to retain their title. In July, James was part of the under-19 squad that won the 2017 UEFA European Under-19 Championship.

In October 2022, following a knee injury sustained playing for Chelsea in the Champions League against AC Milan, James was ruled out of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He later stated he was "devastated" to be excluded from the England squad. In November 2023, following injury, he said he wanted to return to the England squad, after England manager Gareth Southgate said James's Euro 2024 squad position was at risk. In August 2020, James made a personal donation and posted a link on his social media accounts to a Crowdfunder site which was looking to boost Wigan's funds; in a bid to save his former loan club.
