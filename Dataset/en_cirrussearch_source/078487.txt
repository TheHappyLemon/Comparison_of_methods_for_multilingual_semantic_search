.bh is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Bahrain. It is administered by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Bahrain (TRA). The .bh domain was first delegated in 1994 to the University of Bahrain Computer Center. In 1999, the domain was delegated to the Bahrain Telecommunications Company, which since remains the sponsoring organisation. In 2002, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority was established, and in 2008, the Minister of Telecommunications of Bahrain assigned TRA as the governmental agency responsible for the management of the .bh top-level domain. On 6 December 2011, the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority commenced a request to ICANN for redelegation of the “.BH” top-level domain. In March 2012, this request was completed. Registration directly at second level is available internationally, while all registrations under the second level domain names listed below, require a local presence and relevant local licences.
