The triathlon competitions at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo featured fifty-five athletes competing in each of the men's and women's events. The 2020 Olympics were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also added the new mixed team relay event. The Olympic triathlon contains three components; a 1.5 km (0.93 mi) swim, 40 km (25 mi) cycle, and a 10 km (6.2 mi) run. The competitions take the form of a single event between all competitors with no heats. The new mixed team event features teams of four (two men and two women). Each athlete performs a triathlon of 300 m (980 ft) swim, 8 km (5.0 mi) cycle, and a 2 km (1.2 mi) run in a relay format. The qualification period spanned from 11 May 2018 to 11 May 2020. A total of 110 athletes (55 for each gender) vied for the coveted spots with a maximum of three per gender for each NOC. Qualification places are awarded first through the ITU mixed relay rankings of 31 March 2020, with seven NOCs each earning four quota spots (two per gender). Three more NOCs can earn four quota spots apiece at the 2020 ITU Mixed Relay Olympic Qualification Event. Individual rankings of 11 May 2020 are considered next, with the top 26 individuals per gender qualifying, subject to the limit of three per NOC and ignoring the first two from each NOC that qualified via mixed teams. One additional spot for each continent will go to the highest-ranked competitor from an NOC that has not yet earned a qualifying spot. The host, Japan, is guaranteed two spots per gender. The final two spots per gender are awarded through Tripartite Commission invitations. All times and dates use Japan Standard Time (UTC+9). All event times are subject to change.
