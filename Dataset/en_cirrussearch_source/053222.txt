It is located in Russia, in southwestern Siberia. and occupies 53,000 km2 (13,000,000 acres), which is about 2% of the whole area of peat bogs of the world. The swamp is located in the Novosibirsk, Omsk, and Tomsk regions of Russia within the watershed of Ob River and Irtysh River, and stretches between latitudes 55°35' and 58°40' North, and longitudes 74°30' and 83°30' East. It appeared nearly 10,000 years ago and from that time has constantly increased in size. 75% of the contemporary area became waterlogged less than 500 years ago. The swamp is a major reservoir of fresh water for the region, and the Vasyugan river has its source there. It is home to a number of endangered species which is a concern among local environmentalists as the production of oil and gas has become a major industry in the region. The swamp has a continental climate (Walter system) or taiga (WWF system), with long cold winters and short hot summers.
