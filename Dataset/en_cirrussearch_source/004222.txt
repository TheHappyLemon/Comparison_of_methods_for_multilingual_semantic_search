Ēriks Raisters (26 November 1913 – 25 May 1942) was a Latvian footballer who played as a forward. He made 27 international appearances for the Latvia national team between 1934 and 1940. Raisters' first senior club was JKS Riga, a club known for raising young players who then left for bigger and stronger sides. Raisters joined the side in 1931 and in his first year the club earned promotion back to the Latvian Higher League (Virsliga). Raisters played two more years for JKS and it finished 5th in the league in both years. However, before the 1934 season he joined the most successful Latvian club - RFK Riga for which he played until 1940. Over the years he played with RFK Raisters, won three Latvian league titles and the Latvian Cup two times (in 1937 and 1939). After Latvia was taken over by the Soviet Union and the former's sports clubs were disbanded Raisters was selected to play for FK Dinamo Riga in 1940. The next year he played for Belarusian team Dynamo Minsk.

He became a regular in the national team in 1935. In his second match for Latvia (against Lithuania once again) on 30 May 1935 Raisters scored his first goal for the country. In total he played four matches for Latvia in 1935, two in 1936, eight in 1937, eight in 1938, three in 1939 and one in 1940 - in the last international match for Latvia before 1992.
