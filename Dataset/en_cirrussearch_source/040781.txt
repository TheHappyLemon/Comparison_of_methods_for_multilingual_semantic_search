Raphaël Adelino José Guerreiro ComM (European Portuguese: [ʁɐfɐˈɛl ɡɨˈʁɐjɾu]; born 22 December 1993) is a professional footballer who plays as a left-back or midfielder for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich and the Portugal national team. He began his career at Caen, signing in 2013 with Lorient where he made his Ligue 1 debut. In June 2016, he joined Borussia Dortmund, going on to win two DFB-Pokal and the 2019 DFL-Supercup. He moved to Bayern Munich in 2023 on a free transfer. Born in France, Guerreiro represented Portugal at under-21 and senior level, first appearing for the latter in 2014. He was part of their squad at two World Cups and two European Championships, winning Euro 2016. Born in Le Blanc-Mesnil, Seine-Saint-Denis to a Portuguese father and a French mother, Guerreiro played youth football for three clubs, finishing his development at Caen after signing in 2009 at the age of 15. After starting as a senior with the reserve team, he made his professional debut in the 2012–13 season, appearing in all the games and failing to start only once in an eventual fourth-place finish in Ligue 2; he was also elected to the Team of the Year. On 27 June 2013, Guerreiro moved to Ligue 1 after signing a four-year contract with Lorient. His maiden appearance in the competition took place on 10 August, as he featured the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 away loss against Lille. On 1 November 2014, Guerreiro scored his first goal for Lorient, opening the scoring at title-holders Paris Saint-Germain in an eventual 2–1 defeat. He finished the campaign with seven goals to help his team stave off relegation, including the equaliser as they came from behind to defeat his former employers 2–1 at the Stade du Moustoir. Guerreiro opened the scoring in a Derby Breton on 24 October 2015, assisted by Majeed Waris in a 1–1 home draw against Rennes. On 16 June 2016, Borussia Dortmund signed Guerreiro on a four-year contract for a reported fee of €12 million (£9.5 million). Under coach Thomas Tuchel, he was primarily deployed as a midfielder. Guerreiro scored his first goal in the UEFA Champions League on 14 September 2016, in a 6–0 away win against Legia Warsaw in the group phase. In the 2018–19 edition of the competition, and also at that stage, he added braces in victories over Atlético Madrid (4–0, home) and Monaco (2–0). On 27 May 2023, in the last matchday, Guerreiro scored his fourth goal of the season – he also totalled 12 assists– to help the hosts to come back from a 2–0 deficit against Mainz 05 and draw 2–2, but Der Klassiker rivals Bayern Munich defeated 1. FC Köln 2–1 away and were crowned Bundesliga champions instead. The following day, Dortmund announced the departure of five players, including Guerreiro. On 23 June 2023, Bayern Munich announced that they had secured Guerreiro as a free agent; he agreed to a three-year deal. He made his debut for the club on 26 September, coming off the bench in a 4–0 away win over Preußen Münster in the first round of the DFB-Pokal. He scored his first goal on 11 November, taking the field at the hour mark and netting the Bavarians' third in a 4–2 league home victory against 1. FC Heidenheim. Guerreiro accepted the call to represent the Portugal under-21 team after being spotted by Rui Jorge's coaching staff, making his debut on 21 March 2013 in a 0–1 home defeat against Sweden. On 7 November 2014, even though he hardly spoke the language, he was called up by Fernando Santos to the full side, for a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier against Armenia and a friendly with Argentina. He made his debut on 14 November against the former opponent, playing the entire 1–0 win in Faro. Four days later, against Argentina, he scored in the last minute for the only goal at Old Trafford. Guerreiro returned to the under-21s for the 2015 UEFA European Championship in the Czech Republic, helping them finish in second place. He was one of five Portuguese included in the Team of the Tournament. Guerreiro was selected by the main squad for their UEFA Euro 2016 campaign, playing the full 90 minutes in the first game, a 1–1 draw with Iceland in Saint-Étienne. Portugal went on to win the competition, defeating hosts France 1–0 in the final in extra time; following his performances throughout the competition, he was nominated for the Young Player of the Tournament Award, which ultimately went to his teammate Renato Sanches. In spite of an injury-riddled season, Guerreiro was picked for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He started four matches in Russia, in a round-of-16 exit. Guerreiro also made the squad for UEFA Euro 2020. He opened the 3–0 victory over Hungary in the first group fixture, but scored an own goal the following one in a 4–2 loss to Germany. In November 2022, Guerreiro was named in the final squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. On 6 December, he scored his team's fourth in an eventual 6–1 rout of Switzerland in Lusail in the round of 16. In 2014, Guerreiro said that he supported Benfica, dreamed of playing for Real Madrid, and that his favourite player was Cristiano Ronaldo. His Portugal under-21 manager, Rui Jorge, remembered him as a very introverted character, in part due to his language difficulties. Guerreiro and his family used to watch matches of the Portugal national team, of which Pauleta was a footballer he admired.
