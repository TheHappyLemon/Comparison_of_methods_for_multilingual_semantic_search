The 2024 Summer Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques d'été de 2024), officially the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad (French: Jeux de la XXXIIIe Olympiade) and commonly known as Paris 2024, is an upcoming international multi-sport event scheduled to take place from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in France, with Paris as the main host city and 16 other cities spread across metropolitan France, plus one subsite in Tahiti—an island within the French overseas country and overseas collectivity of French Polynesia. Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two cities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris will become the second city, after London (who were the hosts in 1908, 1948 and 2012) to host the Summer Olympics three times. Paris 2024 will mark the centenary of Paris 1924, and these Olympic Games will be the sixth hosted by France (three in summer and three in winter), and the first French Olympics since the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. Following Paris 2024, the Summer Games will return to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, as the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo was delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Paris 2024 will feature the debut of breaking (also known as breakdancing) as an Olympic event, and it will be the final Olympic Games held during the presidency of IOC President Thomas Bach. The Games will be the first to feature identical number of athletes between men and women. The Games are expected to cost €8.3 billion. The five candidate cities were Paris, Hamburg, Budapest, Rome, and Los Angeles. The bidding process was slowed by withdrawals, political uncertainty and deterring costs. Hamburg withdrew its bid on 29 November 2015 after holding a referendum. Rome withdrew on 21  September 2016, citing fiscal difficulties. Budapest withdrew on 22  February 2017, after a petition against the bid collected more signatures than necessary for a referendum. Following these withdrawals, the IOC Executive Board met on 9 June 2017 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the 2024 and 2028 bid processes. The International Olympic Committee formally proposed electing the 2024 and 2028 Olympic host cities at the same time in 2017, a proposal which an Extraordinary IOC Session approved on 11 July 2017 in Lausanne. The IOC set up a process whereby the LA 2024 and Paris 2024 bid committees met with the IOC to discuss which city would host the Games in 2024 and 2028, and whether it was possible to select the host cities for both at the same time. Following the decision to award the two Games simultaneously, Paris was understood to be the preferred host for 2024. On 31 July 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for 2028, enabling Paris to be confirmed as host for 2024. Both decisions were ratified at the 131st IOC Session on 13 September 2017. Paris was elected as the host city on 13 September 2017 at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru. The two French IOC members, Guy Drut and Tony Estanguet, were ineligible to vote under the rules of the Olympic Charter.

The handball tournaments will be held in Lille, which is 225 km (140 mi) from the host city; the sailing and some football games will be held in the Mediterranean city of Marseille, which is 777 km (483 mi) from the host city; meanwhile, the surfing events are expected to be held in Teahupo'o village in the overseas territory of French Polynesia, which is 15,716 km (9,765 mi) from the host city. Football will also be hosted in another five cities, which are Bordeaux, Décines-Charpieu (Lyon), Nantes, Nice and Saint-Étienne, some of which are home to Ligue 1 clubs. Paris 2024 president Tony Estanguet unveiled the Olympic and Paralympic medals for the Games in February 2024, which on the obverse featured embedded hexagon-shaped tokens of scrap iron that had been taken from the original construction of the Eiffel Tower, with the Games logo engraved into it. Approximately 5,084 medals would be produced by the French mint Monnaie de Paris, and were designed by Chaumet, a luxury jewellery firm based in Paris. The reverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, inside the Panathenaic Stadium which hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896. Parthenon and the Eiffel Tower can also be seen in the background on both sides of the medal. Each medal weighs 455–529 g (16–19 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 9.2 mm (0.36 in) thick. The gold medals are made with 98.8 percent silver and 1.13 percent gold, while the bronze medals are made up with copper, zinc, and tin. France reached an agreement with Europol and the UK Home Office to help strengthen security and "facilitate operational information exchange" and "international law enforcement cooperation" during the Games. Within the agreements, it was planned to deploy more drones and sea barriers to prevent small boats from crossing the channel illegally. Police in Paris held inspections and rehearsals within their bomb disposal unit before the Games, similar to their preparations for the 2023 Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France. French president Emmanuel Macron stated France were prepared to switch the location of the opening ceremony depending on the security situation. As a part of Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani visit to France, several agreements were signed between two nations to enhance security for the Olympics. In preparation for the significant security demands and counterterrorist measures, Poland has pledged to contribute security troops, including sniffer dog handlers, to support international efforts aimed at ensuring the safety for the Olympic Games in Paris. The Paris 2024 volunteer platform for the Olympic and Paralympic Games was opened to the public in March 2023. There were expected to be 45,000 volunteers recruited worldwide for the Games. Following the end of registration on 3 May 2023, over 300,000 applications had been submitted to the Paris Organizing Committee, exceeding the number of applicants for the previous two Olympics. Applicants were notified of the outcome of their application between September and December 2023. In July 2021, Paris 2024 president Tony Estanguet stated that the COJOP2024 was conducting a feasibility study on hosting the opening and closing ceremonies outside of a traditional stadium setting, so that they could "marry the best of Paris–the iconic sites–to the possibility of engaging with hundreds of thousands of people, maybe more." This concept of an "open Games" was exemplified in the Paris 2024 handover presentation during the Tokyo 2020 closing ceremony, which featured a live segment from a viewing party at Place du Trocadéro. Estanguet expected the sites for the ceremonies to be announced by the end of the year. On 13 December 2021, it was announced that the opening ceremony will feature athletes being transported by boat from Pont d'Austerlitz to Pont d'Iéna along the Seine river. The 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) route will pass landmarks such as the Louvre, Notre-Dame de Paris, and Place de la Concorde, and feature cultural presentations. The official protocol will take place at a 30,000 seat "mini-stadium" at the Trocadéro. Organisers stated that the ceremony would be the most "spectacular and accessible opening ceremony in Olympic history", with Estanguet stating that it would be free to attend, and estimating that it could attract as many as 600,000 spectators. Thus, the Games will return to its full spectator capacity after the 2020 Games in Tokyo were held mostly behind closed doors as a precaution against the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2024 organizers announced attendence would be closer to 300,000, with 220,000 free tickets distributed due to security concerns. On 23 September 2022, it was announced that the closing ceremonies would be conducted the traditional way, as they will take place at Stade de France. On 8 March 2024, the organizing committee announced that the opening ceremony would start at 7:30 PM (CEST, GMT+2), to enhance the ceremony, with Paris 2024 president Tony Estanguet saying, "We are delighted to launch an Opening Ceremony that beautifully illustrates the intersection between sport and the city. The natural light of the setting sun will add a truly poetic dimension to the event, inviting both athletes and the public to appreciate the natural beauty of the City of Lights." On 19 March 2024 the IOC announced that Russian and Belarusian athletes will not take part in the opening ceremony. In accordance with the current rules of the International Olympic Committee, which have been in force since 2017, the program of the Summer Olympics consists of 28 mandatory "core" sports that persist between Games and a maximum of six optional sports that can be added for each edition of the Games. The optional sports are selected by the relevant Organising Committee, and included in a list that must be sent to the International Olympic Committee not less than five years before each edition in order to improve local interest, provided that the total number of participants does not exceed 10,500 athletes. During the 131st IOC Session in September 2017, the IOC approved the 28 sports of the 2016 program for Paris 2024, while also inviting the Paris Organising Committee to submit up to five additional sports for consideration. When Paris was bidding for the Games in August 2017, the Paris Organising Committee announced that it would hold talks with the IOC and professional esports organisations about the possibility of introducing competitive events in 2024. In July 2018, the IOC confirmed that it would not consider esports for the 2024 Olympics. On 21 February 2019, the Paris Organising Committee proposed the inclusion of breakdancing (breaking), along with skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing - three sports that debuted at the then-upcoming 2020 Summer Olympics - as optional sports. All four additional sports were approved during the 134th IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 24 June 2019. Scheduled to feature 32 sports encompassing 329 events, Paris 2024 will be the first Summer Olympics since 1960 to have fewer events than the previous edition. In the table below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses. The disciplines of karate and baseball/softball have both been removed from the program since 2020, with the loss of 10 events in total, while four events have been dropped from the weightlifting discipline. In canoeing, two sprint events have been replaced with two slalom events, keeping the overall total at 16. Introduced as a new discipline, breaking has added two events to the program, while in sport climbing, the previous "combined" event has been split up to create the separate events of "speed climbing" and "boulder-and-lead" for each gender. In February 2023, USA Boxing announced its decision to boycott the 2023 World Championships (organized by the International Boxing Association) where Russian and Belarusian athletes would compete with no restrictions, also accusing the IBA of attempting to sabotage IOC-approved qualification pathway for the 2024 Summer Olympics: Poland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Canada later joined the U.S. The following is a list of National Olympic Committees who have qualified at least one athlete for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees As of 1 April 2024[update] The following schedule is correct as of the latest schedule released in March 2024. The exact schedule can change up until the end of the games. All times and dates use Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) The emblem for the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympics was unveiled on 21 October 2019 at the Grand Rex. Inspired by Art Deco, it is a representation of Marianne, the national personification of France, with a flame formed in negative space by her hair. The emblem also resembles a gold medal. Tony Estanguet explained that the emblem symbolised "the power and the magic of the Games", and the Games being "for people". The use of a female figure also serves as an homage to the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, which were the first to allow women to participate. The emblem was designed by the French designer Sylvain Boyer with the French design agencies Ecobranding & Royalties. The emblem for Paris 2024 was considered the biggest new logo release of 2019 by many design magazines. An Opinion Way survey shows that 83 per cent of French people say they like the new Paris 2024 Games emblem. Approval ratings were high, with 82 per cent of those surveyed finding it aesthetically appealing and 78 per cent finding it to be creative. It was met with some mockery on social media, one user commenting that the logo "would be better suited to a dating site or a hair salon". For the first time, the 2024 Summer Paralympics is sharing the same emblem as its corresponding Olympics, with no difference, reflecting a shared "ambition" between both events. On 14 November 2022, The Phryges were unveiled as the mascots of the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympics; they are a pair of anthropomorphic Phrygian caps, a historic French symbol of freedom and liberty. Marianne is commonly depicted wearing the Phrygian cap, including in the Eugène Delacroix painting, Liberty Leading the People. The two mascots share a motto of "Alone we go faster, but together we go further". The Olympic poster for these games was revealed on 4 March 2024. Designed by Uga Gattoni, the poster uses a diptych design, with one half representing the Olympics and the other half representing the Paralympics. For the first time, the Olympic poster and Paralympic poster were designed together, as each one can work independently as halves, or be combined into one poster all together. The posters took 2,000 hours, across six months to complete. Belgian beverage company AB InBev became the first Worldwide Olympic Partner during the Games. In France, domestic rights to the 2024 Summer Olympics are owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (formerly Discovery Inc.) via Eurosport, with free-to-air coverage sub-licensed to the country's public broadcaster France Télévisions. There were various issues that caused concerns and controversies related to the Olympics.
