Shirvan (Azerbaijani: Şirvan) is a city in Azerbaijan, located on the Kura River. It was called Zubovka until 1938 and Ali Bayramli until 2008. From 1938 to 1954, Shirvan possessed the status of a village. It obtained the status of a city of Republican level on January 4, 1963. The territory of Shirvan is 72.7 km2, and the population is 87,400 according to the 2020 census. Population density is 1226 persons per 1 km2. The city also includes the settlement of Hajigarahmanly and Bairamly. 98.5% of the population are Azerbaijani, while others - Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, Turks, and other natives. Shirvan originally was the name of Caucasian Zone (From north of Kura river of modern Azerbaijan areas) from 809 A.D till nowadays. But the city Shirvan originated in the 19th century as the Russian resettlement village Zubovka, named in honor of Valerian Zubov, while it was known locally as Qarachukhar. Throughout history, Şirvan changed its name a few times. In 1796, a special military squad led by General Zubov entered Azerbaijan. Yekaterina showed great interest in this march. 30 thousand troops were given to General Zubov's army. The rally began in St. Petersburg in the church, and the priests blessed the supreme commander and the Russian-Cossack forces. General Zubov, who successfully progressed in Azerbaijan, named the village Yekaterinaserd. Two thousand Russian Kazaks were transferred here as the first event. They were equipped with military and agricultural tools. They would plant or harvest crops and caterpillars, and they would use the weapon as they wanted. The city was called Zubovka prior to 1938, then was renamed Ali Bayramli in honor of Ali Bayramov from 1938 to 2008. The city was renamed to 'Şirvan' by the decision of the Parliament of Azerbaijan on April 25, 2008. 'Shirvan' appears to be derived from Shīr (Persian: شیر, 'Lion'). Throughout its history, Shirvan has suffered from floods because of its proximity to the river and the relatively low elevation of most of the town.
