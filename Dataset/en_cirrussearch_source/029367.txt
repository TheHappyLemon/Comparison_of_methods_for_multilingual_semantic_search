Oscar Camenzind (born 12 September 1971 in Schwyz, Switzerland) is a former professional road racing cyclist from Switzerland. He became national road champion in 1997. In 1998 he won the World Road Championship and the Giro di Lombardia, in 2000 the Tour de Suisse and Liège–Bastogne–Liège in 2001. His career came to an abrupt end when he retired from pro cycling after a positive doping test in July 2004 for erythropoietin, leading into the Athens Olympics. After confessing to the use, in 2005 he was sued in Swiss court in order to name his supplier, which he refused to do fearing retribution. 1989 2nd Road race, National Junior Road Championships 1994 2nd GP Palio del Recioto 1996 2nd GP d'Europe 2nd Overall GP Tell 1st Stages 3b & 4 2nd À travers Lausanne 2nd Josef Voegeli Memorial 3rd Wartenberg Rundfahrt 7th Overall Giro di Puglia 1997 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st Overall GP Tell 1st Stage 2b 1st Breitling Grand Prix 2nd Overall Tour de Suisse 1st Stages 1 & 9 3rd Overall Tour of Austria 1st Stage 5 2nd Rominger Classic 4th Rund um Köln 4th À travers Lausanne 4th Josef Voegeli Memorial 1998 1st Road race, UCI Road World Championships 1st Giro di Lombardia 2nd Milano–Torino 2nd Tour de Berne 3rd GP du canton d'Argovie 4th Overall Giro d'Italia 6th Trofeo Melinda 1999 1st Stage 3 Giro del Trentino 3rd Tour de Berne 4th Giro di Lombardia 4th La Flèche Wallonne 4th Breitling Grand Prix 5th Overall Tour de Suisse 1st Stage 7 5th Overall Tour de Romandie 6th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 8th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 9th Josef Voegeli Memorial 2000 1st Overall Tour de Suisse 2nd À travers Lausanne 2nd EnBW Grand Prix 7th Züri-Metzgete 2001 1st Liège–Bastogne–Liège 1st Stage 10 Tour de Suisse 3rd Luk-Cup Bühl 7th Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 10th Overall Tour de Romandie 2002 1st Overall Sachsen Tour International 1st Stage 2 2nd Milano–Torino 3rd Giro di Lombardia 3rd Overall Vuelta a Murcia 8th Züri-Metzgete 9th Overall Tour Méditerranéen 2003 1st Stage 3 Sachsen Tour International 7th Züri-Metzgete 3rd Coppa Placci 4th Road race, National Road Championships 4th Tre Valli Varesine 4th Giro del Veneto 9th Giro dell'Emilia 7th Trofeo Matteotti 2004 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 3rd Trofeo Matteotti List of doping cases in cycling List of sportspeople sanctioned for doping offences "National Championship, Road, Elite, Switzerland (Men)".
