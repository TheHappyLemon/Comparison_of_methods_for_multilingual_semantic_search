In August 2013, after a trial period at Gent, he refused a transfer offer from the club and made his senior debut with Vushtrria. In September 2013, after suffering an injury, Rashica moved to Hannover for treatment and only returned to his parent club in 2014. On 10 September 2014, Rashica moved to Vitesse on a trial basis, appearing for the club's youth team.
