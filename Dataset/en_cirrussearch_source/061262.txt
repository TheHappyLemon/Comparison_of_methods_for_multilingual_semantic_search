Armero was rested for the first round of 2011–12 Serie A and started in his first UEFA Europa League match on 15 September. With the team changing its tactics back to 3–5–2, Armero remained left wing-back, also scoring the winning goal. On 9 January 2013, Armero joined Napoli on loan until the end of the season, with the option to make a permanent switch in the summer. He mostly made his appearances coming off the bench for the remainder of the 2012–13 season. During the 2013 summer transfer window, Napoli made the permanent move for a reported €4 million. On 31 January 2014, Armero completed his loan move to West Ham United until the end of the season. He made his West Ham debut on 15 March in a 3–1 away defeat to Stoke City.

On 20 June 2014, Udinese announced they had signed back Armero, a season after he left to Napoli. On 11 August 2014, the club announced his loan move to Milan for the 2014–15 season.
