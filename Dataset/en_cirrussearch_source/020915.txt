Leipzig (official name: Landkreis Leipzig) is a district (Kreis) in the Free State of Saxony in eastern Germany. It is named after the city of Leipzig, which borders onto the district, but the city is not part of the district. Leipzig district has borders with (from the west and clockwise) the state of Saxony-Anhalt, the urban district of Leipzig, the districts of Nordsachsen and Mittelsachsen, and the state of Thuringia. The district is located in the lowlands around Leipzig, the Leipzig Bay, and is rather flat. Individual hills are found in the north (Hohburg Hills) and south of the district. Its main rivers are the Mulde, Pleiße and White Elster. Also worth mentioning are the many lakes of the Leipzig Neuseenland in the west of the county, which were formed by deliberately flooding old brown coal pits. The district was established by merging the former districts Muldentalkreis and Leipziger Land as part of the district reform of August 2008.
