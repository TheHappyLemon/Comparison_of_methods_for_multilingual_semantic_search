At the start of the video, Horler is sitting up on her bed, with her boyfriend next to her. Her boyfriend gets ready to leave. Horler then holds out what appears to look a bit like an airline ticket. Her boyfriend takes it and leaves. Horler then goes on her laptop, where she can see everything her boyfriend is doing. Her boyfriend has left the house and is driving to a lounge. He gets out of the car and goes in, where he meets another girl and is acting lovingly with her. Horler then drives to the lounge in her car, and the video returns to Horler's boyfriend. He takes the girl to get some drinks, and then as the two of them go downstairs, the video shifts to Horler who is at the lounge and is sitting down with people dancing behind her. After this, Horler's boyfriend appears again with the girl. The two of them are in a deserted room and are about to kiss. Her boyfriend is then shown sitting on the bed, and the girl is asleep. Horler appears looking puzzled. Her boyfriend removes a picture in the room, where there is a safe. He opens the safe and takes out a necklace. Horler then goes downstairs, and as her boyfriend is coming out of the hallway, she meets him and places her hand on his mouth. Horler takes her boyfriend to another room, where she pushes him on the bed, takes off his jacket and kisses him. She then goes to another room, leaving her boyfriend in that room. Her boyfriend gets up and knocks on the door, to find there is no response. He opens the door and finds the curtains fluttering in the wind. He is upset, and then he rushes to another room, and finds his jacket, but no necklace. The video ends with Horler walking out of the lounge wearing the necklace. She gets into her car and gives a wink as she drives away. Music video at YouTube "All Around The World Discography". All Around The World official website. Archived from the original on 2009-09-17.
