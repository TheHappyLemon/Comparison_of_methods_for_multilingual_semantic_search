Julien Gauthier (born October 15, 1997) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward for the Bridgeport Islanders of the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL). Gauthier was drafted 21st overall by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. He has previously played for the Hurricanes, New York Rangers and the Ottawa Senators. Gauthier was drafted by Val-d'Or Foreurs in the first round (sixth overall) of the 2013 QMJHL Entry Draft, and played with Val-d'Or from the 2013–14 season to the 2016–17 season. On July 9, 2016, Gauthier was signed to his first NHL deal in agreeing to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Carolina Hurricanes. In the following 2016–17 season, his fourth season with the Foreurs, Gauthier had registered 27 points in 23 games before he was traded to contending team, the Saint John Sea Dogs in exchange for future picks and Nathan Cyr-Trottier on January 6, 2017. He played with future NHL teammates Thomas Chabot and Mathieu Joseph with the Sea Dogs. After playing one season for the Sea Dogs, Gauthier attended the Hurricanes training camp prior to the 2017–18 season and was assigned to the Charlotte Checkers, the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate of the Hurricanes. During the 2019–20 season, on February 18, 2020, Gauthier was traded by the Hurricanes to the New York Rangers in exchange for defenceman Joey Keane. On February 10, 2021, Gauthier scored his first career NHL goal against the Boston Bruins. After spending the end of the 2019–20 season and the entire 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons with the Rangers, Gauthier cleared waivers and was assigned to New York's AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, prior to the start of the 2022–23 season. On October 26, 2022, Gauthier was recalled by the Rangers. On February 19, 2023, Gauthier was traded, along with a conditional draft pick in the 2023 NHL Entry Draft, to the Ottawa Senators for Tyler Motte. In his debut with the Senators he played on a line with Parker Kelly and Ridly Greig against the Boston Bruins on February 20. He scored his first goal with the Senators against Samuel Montembeault on February 25 in a 5–2 win over the Montreal Canadiens. As a free agent from the Senators, Gauthier was signed to a two-year, $1.575 million contract with the New York Islanders on July 5, 2023. He made his Islanders debut against the Buffalo Sabres on October 21. He scored his first goal with the Islanders against Anthony Stolarz on December 2, in a 4–3 win over the Florida Panthers. After 27 games with the Islanders, having scored 4 goals and 11 points, Gauthier was placed on waivers on February 2, 2024. He went unclaimed and was assigned to the Islanders' AHL affiliate, the Bridgeport Islanders. On December 1, 2015, Gauthier was invited to the Team Canada selection camp for the 2016 World Junior Hockey Championships. He was the only draft-eligible player to end up participating in the tournament for Canada. However, the team finished sixth in the tournament. Gauthier was again invited to Team Canada's selection camp for the 2017 World Junior Hockey Championships. He was one of five players from the 2016 team to be named to the 2017 team. He scored two goals, including the game winner, in a 5–3 win over the Czech Republic in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, Gauthier scored twice more, including the game winner, in a 5–2 win over Sweden. However, Canada was defeated by Team USA in the final to take the silver medal.
