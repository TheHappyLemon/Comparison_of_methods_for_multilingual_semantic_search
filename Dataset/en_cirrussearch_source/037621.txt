As a teenager, Harris also suffered from adenomyosis. In 2012, Harris began a relationship with Peter Legler. On the topic of having children, Harris stated in a 2017 interview with Woman magazine: People ask, 'So when are you going to have children?' I think it's a really odd thing because it's such a personal decision. And also, you don't know what is happening in someone's life. I find it bizarre, even with my friends, when they want me to have children. Why would you encourage anybody to have children unless it was their burning desire? You need to be fully committed to it ... Have children when you're ready, if you're ready, but only then. I'd never had any pressure. In addition to numerous acting awards, Harris was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours, for services to drama. She received the honour from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on 23 February 2017.
