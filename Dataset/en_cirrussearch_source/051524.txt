Artistic swimming (formerly synchronised swimming) competitions at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan featured a total of 104 athletes competing in two medal events, namely the women's duet and the women's team. The events took place in 2021 following the Games' postponement from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the team competitions, the best ranked NOC in each of the five continental championships, with the exception of the host country Japan, qualified. The remaining NOCs are able to qualify for the two highest-ranked spots at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships and the three highest-ranked spots at the Olympic Qualification Tournament. For the duet, the best ranked NOC in each of the five continental championships that did not have a qualified team is to be assured of a secured spot, while the other seven top-ranked NOCs are to be selected through the Olympic Qualification Tournament. All 10 NOCs that had already qualified in the team event automatically qualify a duet (which much consist of members of the team).  Australia (8)  Austria (2)  Belarus (2)  Canada (8)  China (8)  Colombia (2)  Egypt (8)  France (2)  Great Britain (2)  Greece (8)  Israel (2)  Italy (8)  Japan (8)  Kazakhstan (2)  Liechtenstein (2)  Mexico (2)  Netherlands (2)  ROC (8)  Spain (8)  South Africa (2)  Ukraine (8)  United States (2) All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+9).   *   Host nation (Japan) Artistic swimming at the 2018 Asian Games Artistic swimming at the 2019 Pan American Games Artistic swimming at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships "Joint Statement from the International Olympic Committee and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee".
