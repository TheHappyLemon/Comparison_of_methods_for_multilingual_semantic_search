On 14 September, he made his debut against Spezia, which ended 1–0 for the Rossoblu. Despite his young age and lack of experience, Gomis played as a starter collected 39 appearances, plus one appearance in the playoffs, as well as one in Coppa Italia. At the end of the season he was recalled by Torino, who decided to loan him again, but only after he was made available for the preliminaries of the Europa League as second choice goalkeeper, behind Daniele Padelli, against Brommapojkarna on 31 July 2014. On 11 August 2014, Alfred was officially loaned to Avellino in Serie B with a buyout clause, plus a buyback clause in favour of Torino.

On 28 October 2014, he parried a penalty kicked by Rodrigo Taddei in the final minutes of a match against Perugia, ending 0–0. He played 31 matches in the league and finished first in the Top 15 of the goalkeepers in Serie B according to a list compiled by the Lega Serie B. On 30 July 2015, he was loaned to newly relegated Serie B club Cesena with a buyout clause and a buy-back clause in favour of Torino. On 31 August 2016, he was loaned to Bologna as an emergency signing to replace Antonio Mirante, who was diagnosed with a heart problem. However, Gomis himself was injured soon after his arrival. He made his debut for Bologna in Coppa Italia against Verona. Gomis was dropped out again after the cup match, including the league and the round 16 of the cup. He was recalled by Torino, and on 18 January 2018 he was loaned to Salernitana in Serie B. On 8 July 2017, Gomis joined SPAL on loan with an obligation to buy at the end of the loan period. The permanent deal for undisclosed fee was announced on 20 June 2018. On 20 August 2019, Gomis joined Dijon FCO from SPAL for an undisclosed fee on a four-year-contract. On 29 September 2020, Gomis joined fellow Ligue 1 side Rennes on a five-year deal, replacing the outgoing Édouard Mendy. On 27 January 2023, Gomis returned to Italy and joined Como in Serie B for the rest of the season. Gomis was called up to Italy under-20 in 2013 by Luigi Di Biagio, but did not make any appearances. In the same year, he was also called up to the Italy under-21 Serie B representative team by Massimo Piscedda [it], against the representative team from Russian Football National League. He was summoned by Piscedda for another game against the Italy under-21 played at the Partenio in Avellino. A starter on this occasion, he remained on the field for 68 minutes without conceding a goal.
