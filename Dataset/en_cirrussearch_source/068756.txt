Óscar Mingueza García (born 13 May 1999) is a Spanish professional association football player who plays as a defender for La Liga club Celta Vigo. Mainly a centre-back, he can also play in either full-back position, mostly as a right-back. Born in Santa Perpètua de Mogoda, Barcelona, Catalonia, Mingueza joined Barcelona's La Masia academy in 2007 from Santa Perpètua. He won the UEFA Youth League with the club's Juvenil A team in 2018, and moved up to Barcelona B for the 2018–19 season. Mingueza made his first-team debut for Barcelona on 24 November 2020, as a replacement for the injured Gerard Piqué, starting the 4–0 2020–21 UEFA Champions League group stage victory against Dynamo Kyiv at the NSC Olimpiyskiy in Kyiv. Five days later, he made his La Liga debut in a 4–0 win against Osasuna at Camp Nou.[citation needed] On 15 March 2021, Mingueza scored his first goal for Barcelona in a 4–1 home win over Huesca in La Liga. He scored his second career goal in the 60th minute of El Clásico on 10 April 2021.[citation needed] One week later, he won his first professional title, after winning the 2020–21 Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao. On 31 July 2022, Mingueza joined fellow La Liga side Celta Vigo on a permanent four-year deal for a reported fee of €3 million. Due to the isolation of some national team players following the positive COVID-19 test of Sergio Busquets, Spain's under-21 squad were called up for the international friendly against Lithuania on 8 June 2021. Mingueza made his senior debut in the match as Spain won 4–0. Later that month, he was included in Spain's preliminary squad for the 2020 Summer Olympics. Óscar's younger sister, Ariadna, is also a professional footballer having made her debut for Barcelona's women's team on 6 March 2021.
