In mathematics, a divisor of an integer n,{\displaystyle n,} also called a factor of n,{\displaystyle n,} is an integer m{\displaystyle m} that may be multiplied by some integer to produce n.{\displaystyle n.} In this case, one also says that n{\displaystyle n} is a multiple of m.{\displaystyle m.} An integer n{\displaystyle n} is divisible or evenly divisible by another integer m{\displaystyle m} if m{\displaystyle m} is a divisor of n{\displaystyle n}; this implies dividing n{\displaystyle n} by m{\displaystyle m} leaves no remainder. An integer n{\displaystyle n} is divisible by a nonzero integer m{\displaystyle m} if there exists an integer k{\displaystyle k} such that n=km.{\displaystyle n=km.} This is written as m∣n.{\displaystyle m\mid n.} This may be read as that m{\displaystyle m} divides n,{\displaystyle n,} m{\displaystyle m} is a divisor of n,{\displaystyle n,} m{\displaystyle m} is a factor of n,{\displaystyle n,} or n{\displaystyle n} is a multiple of m.{\displaystyle m.} If m{\displaystyle m} does not divide n,{\displaystyle n,} then the notation is m∤n.{\displaystyle m\not \mid n.} There are two conventions, distinguished by whether m{\displaystyle m} is permitted to be zero: With the convention without an additional constraint on m,{\displaystyle m,} m∣0{\displaystyle m\mid 0} for every integer m.{\displaystyle m.} With the convention that m{\displaystyle m} be nonzero, m∣0{\displaystyle m\mid 0} for every nonzero integer m.{\displaystyle m.} Divisors can be negative as well as positive, although often the term is restricted to positive divisors. For example, there are six divisors of 4; they are 1, 2, 4, −1, −2, and −4, but only the positive ones (1, 2, and 4) would usually be mentioned. 1 and −1 divide (are divisors of) every integer. Every integer (and its negation) is a divisor of itself. Integers divisible by 2 are called even, and integers not divisible by 2 are called odd. 1, −1, n{\displaystyle n} and −n{\displaystyle -n} are known as the trivial divisors of n.{\displaystyle n.} A divisor of n{\displaystyle n} that is not a trivial divisor is known as a non-trivial divisor (or strict divisor). A nonzero integer with at least one non-trivial divisor is known as a composite number, while the units −1 and 1 and prime numbers have no non-trivial divisors. There are divisibility rules that allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the number's digits. 7 is a divisor of 42 because 7×6=42,{\displaystyle 7\times 6=42,} so we can say 7∣42.{\displaystyle 7\mid 42.} It can also be said that 42 is divisible by 7, 42 is a multiple of 7, 7 divides 42, or 7 is a factor of 42. The non-trivial divisors of 6 are 2, −2, 3, −3. The positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42. The set of all positive divisors of 60, A={1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60},{\displaystyle A=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60\},} partially ordered by divisibility, has the Hasse diagram: There are some elementary rules: If a∣b{\displaystyle a\mid b} and b∣c,{\displaystyle b\mid c,} then a∣c,{\displaystyle a\mid c,} i.e. divisibility is a transitive relation. If a∣b{\displaystyle a\mid b} and b∣a,{\displaystyle b\mid a,} then a=b{\displaystyle a=b} or a=−b.{\displaystyle a=-b.} If a∣b{\displaystyle a\mid b} and a∣c,{\displaystyle a\mid c,} then a∣(b+c){\displaystyle a\mid (b+c)} holds, as does a∣(b−c).{\displaystyle a\mid (b-c).} However, if a∣b{\displaystyle a\mid b} and c∣b,{\displaystyle c\mid b,} then (a+c)∣b{\displaystyle (a+c)\mid b} does not always hold (e.g. 2∣6{\displaystyle 2\mid 6} and 3∣6{\displaystyle 3\mid 6} but 5 does not divide 6). If a∣bc,{\displaystyle a\mid bc,} and gcd(a,b)=1,{\displaystyle \gcd(a,b)=1,} then a∣c.{\displaystyle a\mid c.} This is called Euclid's lemma. If p{\displaystyle p} is a prime number and p∣ab{\displaystyle p\mid ab} then p∣a{\displaystyle p\mid a} or p∣b.{\displaystyle p\mid b.} A positive divisor of n{\displaystyle n} that is different from n{\displaystyle n} is called a proper divisor or an aliquot part of n.{\displaystyle n.} A number that does not evenly divide n{\displaystyle n} but leaves a remainder is sometimes called an aliquant part of n.{\displaystyle n.} An integer n>1{\displaystyle n>1} whose only proper divisor is 1 is called a prime number. Equivalently, a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive factors: 1 and itself. Any positive divisor of n{\displaystyle n} is a product of prime divisors of n{\displaystyle n} raised to some power. This is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. A number n{\displaystyle n} is said to be perfect if it equals the sum of its proper divisors, deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n,{\displaystyle n,} and abundant if this sum exceeds n.{\displaystyle n.} The total number of positive divisors of n{\displaystyle n} is a multiplicative function d(n),{\displaystyle d(n),} meaning that when two numbers m{\displaystyle m} and n{\displaystyle n} are relatively prime, then d(mn)=d(m)×d(n).{\displaystyle d(mn)=d(m)\times d(n).} For instance, d(42)=8=2×2×2=d(2)×d(3)×d(7){\displaystyle d(42)=8=2\times 2\times 2=d(2)\times d(3)\times d(7)}; the eight divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21 and 42. However, the number of positive divisors is not a totally multiplicative function: if the two numbers m{\displaystyle m} and n{\displaystyle n} share a common divisor, then it might not be true that d(mn)=d(m)×d(n).{\displaystyle d(mn)=d(m)\times d(n).} The sum of the positive divisors of n{\displaystyle n} is another multiplicative function σ(n){\displaystyle \sigma (n)} (e.g. σ(42)=96=3×4×8=σ(2)×σ(3)×σ(7)=1+2+3+6+7+14+21+42{\displaystyle \sigma (42)=96=3\times 4\times 8=\sigma (2)\times \sigma (3)\times \sigma (7)=1+2+3+6+7+14+21+42}). Both of these functions are examples of divisor functions. If the prime factorization of n{\displaystyle n} is given by n=p1ν1p2ν2⋯pkνk{\displaystyle n=p_{1}^{\nu _{1}}\,p_{2}^{\nu _{2}}\cdots p_{k}^{\nu _{k}}} then the number of positive divisors of n{\displaystyle n} is d(n)=(ν1+1)(ν2+1)⋯(νk+1),{\displaystyle d(n)=(\nu _{1}+1)(\nu _{2}+1)\cdots (\nu _{k}+1),} and each of the divisors has the form p1μ1p2μ2⋯pkμk{\displaystyle p_{1}^{\mu _{1}}\,p_{2}^{\mu _{2}}\cdots p_{k}^{\mu _{k}}} where 0≤μi≤νi{\displaystyle 0\leq \mu _{i}\leq \nu _{i}} for each 1≤i≤k.{\displaystyle 1\leq i\leq k.} For every natural n,{\displaystyle n,} d(n)<2n.{\displaystyle d(n)<2{\sqrt {n}}.} Also, d(1)+d(2)+⋯+d(n)=nln⁡n+(2γ−1)n+O(n),{\displaystyle d(1)+d(2)+\cdots +d(n)=n\ln n+(2\gamma -1)n+O({\sqrt {n}}),} where γ{\displaystyle \gamma } is Euler–Mascheroni constant. One interpretation of this result is that a randomly chosen positive integer n has an average number of divisors of about ln⁡n.{\displaystyle \ln n.} However, this is a result from the contributions of numbers with "abnormally many" divisors. In definitions that allow the divisor to be 0, the relation of divisibility turns the set N{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } of non-negative integers into a partially ordered set that is a complete distributive lattice. The largest element of this lattice is 0 and the smallest is 1. The meet operation ∧ is given by the greatest common divisor and the join operation ∨ by the least common multiple. This lattice is isomorphic to the dual of the lattice of subgroups of the infinite cyclic group Z.
