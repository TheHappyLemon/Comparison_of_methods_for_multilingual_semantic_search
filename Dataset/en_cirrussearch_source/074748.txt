A re-release of Nothing but the Beat, titled Nothing but the Beat 2.0, was released on 7 September 2012. The first single from the album, "She Wolf (Falling to Pieces)", which saw Guetta collaborate with Sia yet again, was released in support of the album. The next single off Nothing But The Beat 2.0 was confirmed by Guetta as "Just One Last Time" which features vocals from Swedish duo Taped Rai. In 2012, Guetta also made an album named Nothing But The Beat: Ultimate, which combined the two albums Nothing But The Beat and Nothing But The Beat 2.0 together. Summer 2012 Guetta played in Finland in Weekend Festival and he was the festival's headliner also for year 2013. 15 March saw the third single release from Nothing but the Beat 2.0 entitled "Play Hard". The song features vocals from American singers Ne-Yo and Akon. Nothing But the Beat is a feature-length biographical documentary about Guetta's rise to fame, featuring many of his collaborators, including Kelly Rowland, will.i.am and Snoop Dogg. It was financed by the energy drink, burn, with whom Guetta became a brand ambassador from 2011. Together with burn, Guetta also provided support and mentoring for the burn-sponsored "burn studios residency" program for up-and-coming DJs. Guetta also wrote, produced, and featured on Rihanna's seventh studio album, Unapologetic, and acts as the support act for the European leg of her Diamonds World Tour. In 2012, Guetta created a new record label known as Jack Back Records, where he intends to focus only on electronic music releases (compared to the dance pop productions he's most known for). The label is named after a project Guetta started alongside Nicky Romero when they remixed the song "Wild Ones". The premiere release of the new label was "Metropolis", another one of his collaboration with Romero, which also became a track from Nothing but the Beat 2.0. The label also included releases from the likes of Daddy's Groove and other collaborators, as well as a two-track EP from production duo Spencer & Hill. All of the label's releases can be found on Beatport. While on tour with Rihanna, he debuted his new track at Twickenham Stadium on 15 June 2013.

The single version contained vocals from Jamie Scott and Romy Dya. Ellie Goulding's vocals were cut from the song as her label was pushing back the release. That is the reason why the two DJs decided to replace her and use the vocals of Romy Dya. On 25 January 2018 Guetta released a remix version of Sia's Helium along with Dutch DJ Afrojack. This marks Guetta's and Sia's sixth collaboration. On 16 February 2018, David Guetta released his new song "Mad Love", together with Sean Paul and Becky G. A few months before the release Sean Paul reported that Shakira would be the singer of the song, but she has been replaced by Becky G. A week later, Guetta released his second collaboration with Martin Garrix and Dutch DJ Brooks entitled "Like I Do". Guetta's seventh collaboration with Sia, "Flames", was released on 22 March 2018. On 29 June 2018, Guetta announced in an interview with Billboard China that he was almost finished working on his seventh studio album and that it would be released after the summer of 2018. During that summer when he played Tomorrowland, a video emerged of Guetta apparently playing a remixed version of the Spanish Falangist anthem Cara al Sol used during Francisco Franco's dictatorship. However, the video was confirmed to have been faked. On 23 August, Guetta confirmed the album's title as 7 and revealed its track list, including the singles "2U", "Like I Do", "Flames" and "Don't Leave Me Alone". The album also included the Bebe Rexha and J Balvin featured single, "Say My Name". In December 2019, Guetta led a DJ set at an Avicii tribute concert where he previewed a previously unheard collaboration with Avicii, Giorgio Tuinfort and Afrojack.

On 18 April 2020, Guetta performed poolside, overlooking the Downtown Miami skyline and the waters of the Biscayne Bay from his location at the Icon Brickell.

On 30 May 2020, Guetta performed at New York City's Top of the Rock Observation Deck at Rockefeller Center for the second edition of United At Home to a virtual crowd of over 24 million to benefit COVID-19 relief efforts. The event, titled "Major League Soccer and Heineken presents United at Home", raised half a million dollars for Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, Feeding America, World Health Organization and Fondation Hôpitaux de Paris - Hôpitaux de France. The performance was the second edition of “United At Home,” following Guetta's first fundraiser in Miami which raised more than US$750,000 for global charities and drew more than 25 million online views. Funds raised went directly to The Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, chaired by First Lady Chirlane McCray, which is New York City's official fundraising arm for COVID-19 relief. However, Guetta was criticized for this performance, which included a shout-out to the family of George Floyd, followed by a fast-paced electronic dance tune which sampled of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. Critics found this decision to be "tone-deaf." On 7 November 2020, Guetta won DJ Mag's annual Top 100 DJs poll for the second time, almost a decade after he first took the No.1 spot in 2011. Guetta was presented his award during AMF Presents Top 100 DJs, a virtual awards show in Amsterdam that was broadcast to the world.
