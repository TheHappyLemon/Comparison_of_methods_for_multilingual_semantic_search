Jalel Kadri (Arabic: جلال القادري; born on 14 December 1971) is a Tunisian football coach who was most recently the head coach of the Tunisian national football team. In June 2021, he became assistant coach of the Tunisian national team for the second time. This time under Mondher Kebaier, with whom he accompanied the team to the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, where he became head coach in the round of 16 after Kebaier contracted Covid-19. On 23 January 2022, during the match against Nigeria in the round of 16 of the 2021 African Cup of Nations, Kadri replaced the first coach, Mondher Kebaier, at the helm of the team due to his Covid-19 infection, the match ending with a victory for Tunisia 1–0. On 30 January he was appointed temporary coach after being eliminated from the quarter-finals of the Africon against Burkina Faso. In the process, he led the team to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, allowing him to become a permanent coach of the senior side. In the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Kadri's Tunisia once again failed to live up to expectation as Tunisia failed to advance past the group stage due to the 0–1 defeat to Australia in the World Cup group D, despite Tunisia's heroic 1–0 win over defending champions France in the final match. After the cup, Kadri was allowed to remain in charge of Tunisia until 2024. On 24 January 2024, Kadri resigned from his position after the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations group stage exit.
