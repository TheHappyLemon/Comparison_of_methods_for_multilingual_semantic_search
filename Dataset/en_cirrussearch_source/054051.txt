The 2020 UCI Road World Championships is the 93rd edition of the UCI Road World Championships, the annual world championships for road bicycle racing. It took place between 24 and 27 September 2020 in Imola, Italy. The event was originally planned to be held in the Aigle and Martigny area in Switzerland, but this was cancelled on 12 August in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. No under-23 or junior races were contested at the Championships; however, under-23 riders were eligible to compete in the elite races. The road races took place on a 28.8 kilometres (17.9 mi) course, starting and finishing at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari (a motor racing circuit). Heading out from the Autodromo into the Emilia-Romagna countryside, the course used two climbs with an average gradient of 10% separated by the town of Riolo Terme, before returning to the Autodromo. The men's road race would lap the course nine times, and the women's road race would lap the course five times. The time trial events took place on a 31.7 kilometres (19.7 mi) flat course, starting from the Autodromo before turning at Borgo Tossignano to return to the finish line at the Autodromo. Both the men and the women raced on the same course. All times listed below are for the local time – Central European Summer Time or UTC+02:00.   *   Host nation (Italy) The first racing lap of each road race is a kilometre shorter than the full 28.8-kilometre (17.9-mile)-long circuit, as it forms part of the 5.9-kilometre (3.7-mile)-long neutralised section.
