The Russian Army (Russian: Русская армия, romanized: Russkaya armiya), (Russian: pre–1918, tr. Русская армія, IPA: [Russkaya armiya]), commonly known as the Army of Wrangel (Армия Врангеля, Армія Врангеля), was a White Army active in South Russia during the Russian Civil War from March to November 1920. It was officially formed on 28 April 1920 from the merger of several White armies, including the Volunteer Army, in a reorganization of the Armed Forces of South Russia. The Army of Wrangel, nicknamed after its commander General Pyotr Wrangel, fought against Bolshevik forces in the Southern Front and the Ukrainian War of Independence. In November 1920, following defeat at the Siege of Perekop and being vastly outnumbered, the Army of Wrangel organized a successful evacuation from Crimea and subsequently dissolved. Veterans of the army were among the founders of the Russian All-Military Union. The Russian Army had a staff and five Army Corps: May 1920: 22,000 to 27,000 men (at the beginning of 1920 in Crimea 3,500 men, approximately 35,000 to 40,000 were evacuated from the North Caucasus). June 1920: 25,000 men. September 1920: the army and its rear bases had about 300,000 men, of whom about 50,000 on the front, 80,000 in the military camps and 30,000 injured. In September the combat troops of the army counted 30,000 to 35,000 men (33,000 in mid-September). October 1920: 25,000 to 27,000. Of the 50,000 Russian Army officers, 6,000 were in the combat troops, 13,000 in support of the front, and 31,000 at the back (including the sick and wounded). Гагкуев Р. Г., Цветков В. Ж., Голицын В.
