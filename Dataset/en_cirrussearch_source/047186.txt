In his first year in charge, Domžale were promoted to the national top division, the Slovenian PrvaLiga. In 2007 and 2008, Stojanović won back-to-back national titles with the team. In 2009, he was appointed as an assistant manager of Srečko Katanec at the United Arab Emirates. In September 2011, Stojanovič and Katanec were sacked after two successive defeats in the third round of qualifiers for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. On 24 October 2011, Stojanović became the new manager of the Slovenia national team after the Football Association of Slovenia had had the contract with Matjaž Kek terminated by mutual agreement earlier that day. On 9 December 2012, he resigned as the manager of the Slovenia national team. On 24 June 2013, Stojanović replaced Ricardo Sá Pinto as a manager of Red Star Belgrade.

However, his reign was short-lived, with Stojanović getting fired on 4 May 2016. He was replaced by former Beijing Guoan and Guangzhou Evergrande manager Lee Jang-soo. After a spell with Riga FC, Stojanović was appointed at Bulgarian club Levski Sofia on 30 July 2018, replacing Delio Rossi. The term was short-lived, as he was released by the club on 21 January 2019, amid reports of an upcoming move to become head coach of the Latvia national team. On 13 March 2019, Stojanović was confirmed as the new head coach of the Latvia national team. He was sacked in January 2020 after losing nine out of ten matches in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers.
