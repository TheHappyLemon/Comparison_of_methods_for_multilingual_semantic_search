The highest point is the hill Šumina with an elevation of 418 metres (1,371 ft). The Morava River and six its branches flow through the town, which gave it the nickname "Moravian Venice".

The first written mention of Litovel is from 1287, older documents have been proven to be forgeries. The town was founded between 1252 and 1256 by Ottokar II of Bohemia. In 1327, King John of Bohemia allowed the town to build walls. The royal town developed until the Hussite Wars. After the war, Litovel asked for the assignment of a protector and came under the protection of the Vlašim family from Úsov. In the 16th century, the lords of Boskovice acquired the Úsov dominion, Litovel became their property and lost its statute of a royal town. In the early 17th century, Litovel was acquired by the House of Liechtenstein and lost its significance. The town was further affected by the Thirty Years' War, during which was plundered by the Swedish army, and by plague epidemics. In 1850, Litovel became a district town and began to grow with the influx of inhabitants from the surroundings. The Czech population began to prevail over the German, and the town became a centre of Czech culture and education. At the beginning of the 20th century, trade and industry began to develop rapidly, and new factories for processing agricultural products were established. Litovel is known especially for the food industry. In the village of Tři Dvory is located a factory of Adriana, a manufacturer of pasta, and Brazzale, a cheese-producing company which has here one of the largest hard-cheese producing factories in the world. Litovel is also known for its brewery. The tradition of brewing beer here began in 1297. Pro-Ject brand turntables and audio equipment are manufactured in Litovel. The D35 motorway (part of the European route E442) from Olomouc to the Hradec Králové Region runs through the town. The historic town centre is formed by the Přemysla Otakara II.

It was originally a manor house which was sold to the town in 1557. It was reconstructed in 1572 and baroque modified in 1724. The town hall tower, 65 metres (213 ft) tall, was built right over the Nečíz, one of many branches of the Morava that runs underneath the square. The town square is lines by preserved burger houses. A plague column stands in the middle of the square. It was created in 1724. The pillar is decorated with seven statues of plaque patrons and The Holy Virgin on the top.
