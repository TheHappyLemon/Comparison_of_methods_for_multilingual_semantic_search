On 8 August 2011, Oxlade-Chamberlain signed for Premier League club Arsenal. Although neither club involved revealed details of the contractual arrangements, press sources indicated that the fee was a £12 million initial payment which could rise to £15 million with "add-ons".

Arsène Wenger replaced him with Andrey Arshavin in the 78th minute, with the score at 1–1.

On 4 February 2012, Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrated his first two Premier League goals in a home match against Blackburn Rovers which finished in a 7–1 victory to Arsenal. Following this match, Wenger praised Oxlade-Chamberlain for his fast development. After the second leg of the Champions League second round against AC Milan, Oxlade-Chamberlain earned many plaudits for his impressive run of form, and for his display against strong European opposition; he was described by Marco van Basten as a "gem", while then-Arsenal captain Robin van Persie stated Oxlade-Chamberlain was the future of both Arsenal and England.

On 27 September, he scored in the North London derby in a 1–1 draw against Tottenham. On 4 November, he scored to put Arsenal 3–0 up against RSC Anderlecht in the Champions League, although the match eventually finished 3–3. He also scored in the round of 16 match against Monaco in February. Two matches later, he was injured in a 2–1 win against Manchester United in the FA Cup and had to be withdrawn just after half-time. It was later confirmed that he would be out for three to four weeks due to the hamstring injury. On 30 May 2015, Oxlade-Chamberlain came on as a substitute in the 2015 FA Cup final and set up Olivier Giroud to make it 4–0; the final score against Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium. On 2 August 2015, Oxlade-Chamberlain scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Chelsea in the Community Shield. His only league goal that season came away to Bournemouth, the first goal he scored for Arsenal in a league match away from home. On 23 February 2016, he suffered a serious knee injury in a 2–0 home defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League, which was initially expected to prevent him playing for up to eight weeks. A further injury in May during training prevented his return for the rest of the season, including the summer UEFA Euro 2016 tournament. Oxlade-Chamberlain started on the bench for Arsenal's opening day defeat to Liverpool, however Oxlade-Chamberlain replaced the injured Alex Iwobi to score Arsenal's second goal in a 3–4 defeat.

Oxlade-Chamberlain also scored a goal against West Ham United and created an assist for a goal from Alexis Sánchez in Arsenal's first away match at the London Stadium, where they won 5–1. He scored three times in Arsenal's 2016–17 EFL Cup campaign where they reached the quarter-finals of the tournament.

On 18 July, Liverpool confirmed that Oxlade-Chamberlain would miss the majority of the 2018–19 season, with Klopp stating: "It feels like now is an appropriate time to tell people that for Ox this coming season will be about focusing on recovery and rehab". On 28 December, Klopp stated that Oxlade-Chamberlain's rehabilitation was going "ahead of schedule" and that "if he makes further steps like he did in the last few weeks then he can play Premier League football this season, which is nice to know".
