Best Actor in a Leading Role is a British Academy Film Award presented annually by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) to recognize an actor who has delivered an outstanding leading performance in a film. From 1952 to 1967, there were two Best Actor awards: one for a British actor and another for a foreign actor. In 1968, the two prizes of British and Foreign actor were combined to create a single Best Actor award. Its current title, for Best Actor in a Leading Role, has been used since 1995.   indicates the winner Academy Award for Best Actor Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor Guldbagge Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role A1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 : Rules from the 1960s to the 1970s allowed for an actor to receive a single citation for performances in multiple films in the same year.
