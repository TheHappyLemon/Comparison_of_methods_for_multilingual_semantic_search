Hisar Range (Tajik: Қаторкӯҳи Ҳисор; Uzbek: Hisor tizmasi, Russian: Гиссарский хребет; Ukrainian: Ґаторкугі Гісор; Persian: رشته‌کوه حصار; also known as Hissar, Hisor, or Gissar Range) is a mountain range in Central Asia, in the western part of the Pamir-Alay system, stretching over 200 km in the general east–west direction across the territory of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The Hisar Range lies south of the Zarafshon Range, extending north of Dushanbe through Tajikistan's Hissar District of the Districts of Republican Subordination and reaching Uzbekistan at the north tip of Surxondaryo Region. The highest point in the Hissar Range is Alpomish Peak, confirmed when a 2023 survey determined nearby Khazret Sultan to be shorter. With an elevation of 4,668 meters (15,315 ft), the mountain is located on the Uzbekistan-Tajikistan border, just north-west of Dushanbe, and happens to also be the highest point in all of Uzbekistan. The Hissar Range is composed of crystalline rocks, schist, and sandstone, punctured by granite intrusions. Hissor Valley, which encompasses the Shirkent National Park is a 3,000-hectare (7,400-acre) reserve, which is expected to be expanded to some 30,000 ha (74,000 acres) in the coming years, has an unusually high concentration of sites of historical and scientific interest.
