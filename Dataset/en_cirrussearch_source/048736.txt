Kaapo Ville Olavi Kakko (Finnish pronunciation: [Ààk…ëÀêpo Ààk…ëkÀêo]; born 13 February 2001) is a Finnish professional ice hockey forward for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Kakko was selected second overall by the Rangers in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. Kakko plays right wing, but also has experience playing at centre. He made his professional debut playing with TPS of the Finnish Liiga. On 21 June 2019, as the top-ranked European skater heading into the 2019 NHL Entry Draft, Kakko was selected second overall by the New York Rangers. On 11 July 2019, he was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Rangers. Kakko made his NHL debut for the Rangers on 3 October 2019. He scored his first NHL career goal on 12 October at home against the Edmonton Oilers, becoming the eighth player in Rangers franchise history to score a goal at the age of 18 or younger. He also became the second player in NHL history born in the 21st century to score a goal, after Ville Heinola (also born in 2001) of the Winnipeg Jets, who scored a goal just hours before Kakko on the same day. Following the conclusion of his entry-level contract with the Rangers, Kakko as a restricted free agent was re-signed to a two-year, $4.2 million contract extension with New York on 28 July 2022. Kakko scored the gold-medal-winning goal for team Finland in the 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships on 5 January 2019.
