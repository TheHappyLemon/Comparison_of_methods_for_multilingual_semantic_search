Mount Terror (77°31′S 168°32′E﻿ / ﻿77.517°S 168.533°E﻿ / -77.517; 168.533) is an extinct volcano about 3,230 metres (10,600 ft) high on Ross Island, Antarctica, about 20 nautical miles (37 km; 23 mi) eastward of Mount Erebus. Mount Terror was named in 1841 by Sir James Clark Ross for his second ship, HMS Terror. The captain of Terror was Francis Crozier, a close friend of Ross for whom the nearby Cape Crozier is named.[citation needed] Mount Terror is a large shield volcano that forms the eastern part of Ross Island, Antarctica. It has numerous cinder cones and domes on the flanks of the shield and is mostly under snow and ice. It is the second largest of the four volcanoes that make up Ross Island and is somewhat overshadowed by its neighbour, Mount Erebus, 30 kilometres (30,000 m) to the west.[citation needed] The rocks at the summit have not been studied, but rocks from the lower areas range from 0.82 to 1.75 million years old, and Mount Terror shows no signs of more recent volcanic activity. The first ascent of Mount Terror was made by a New Zealand party in 1959.[citation needed] The mountain is to the west of Cape Crozier, and east of Mount Terra Nova and Mount Erebus.

Mount Terror is the stronghold of Russian anarchist revolutionaries in the 1894 science fiction novel Olga Romanoff by George Griffith. Mount Terror and Mount Erebus are mentioned in the 1936 novella At the Mountains of Madness by H.P. Lovecraft. Mount Terror is used as a location in the 2004 novel State of Fear by Michael Crichton.
