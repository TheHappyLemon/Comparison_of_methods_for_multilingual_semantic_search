The Brda (Polish: [brda] ; German: Brahe) is a river in northern Poland. A tributary of Vistula River, the Brda has a total length of 245 km and a catchment area of 4,665 km2, all within Poland. The Brda is part of the Odra-Vistula waterway, connecting these two rivers via the Warta and Noteć rivers and the Bydgoszcz Canal since the end of the 18th century. The waterway is navigable for modest barges (of CEMT Class II) but with a limited draught. With the expansion of the European Union to the East, the waterway could play an important role. It is a link in the much longer connection with Eastern Europe via the Vistula, Narew, Bug, Mukhavets, Pripyat, and Dnieper Rivers, but this connection remains unnavigable due to a dam near Brest, Belarus. Currently, only limited numbers of vessels use the Brda River and the adjacent canal (however, the traffic was significantly larger from 1950s to 1970s, then diminishing step by step as time went by). It is expected that the waterway will be discovered by leisure boaters in the future. (Source: NoorderSoft Waterways Database) Brda is one of the most beautiful kayak routes in Poland. The trail is 233 km long, and it goes through forests, lakes and fields.
