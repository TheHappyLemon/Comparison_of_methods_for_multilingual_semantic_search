Chin State (Burmese: ချင်းပြည်နယ်; MLCTS: hkyang: pranynai, pronounced [tɕʰɪ́ɰ̃ pjìnɛ̀]) is a state in western Myanmar. Chin State is bordered by Sagaing Division and Magway Division to the east, Rakhine State to the south, the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh to the west, and the Indian states of Mizoram to the west and Manipur to the north. The population of Chin State is about 488,801 according to the 2014 census, and its capital city is Hakha. The state is named for the Chin people, an ethnic group native to Chin State and neighboring Rakhine State. Much of the state is mountainous and sparsely populated, with few transportation links and low levels of economic development. It also has Myanmar's highest poverty rate, at 58%, according to a 2017 report. Situated in a far hilly region, Chin Hills was traditionally autonomous and far from their neighboring powers like Burman kingdoms in the east and Indian states in the west to reach. Until the British advancement in the region, independent city-states such as Ciimnuai (Chinwe/Chin Nwe) later shifted to Tedim and Vangteh in the north, Tlaisun (also recorded as Tashon) and Rallang in the mid-land, and Hakha, Thantlang and Zokhua (Yokwa) in the south played important political role in securing peace of the region, and each city-state practised its own independent sovereignty in their own rights. Upon Burma's independence from the United Kingdom in 1948, the Chin Hills Special Division was created, with its capital at Falam. Hakha later became the capital. However, three townships that are today part of present-day Chin State (Mindat, Kanpetlet and Matupi) were previously part of the Pakokku Hill Tracts of Pakokku District and Paletwa Township of the Arakan Hill Tracts, until 4 January 1974. On this date, the Chin Hills Special Division was granted state status and became Chin State. "Chin National Day" is designated on 20 February to commemorate the "General Assembly of Chinland" held in 1948. The first celebration of Chin National Day was held in 1951, but it was not recognized by the Myanmar government until the 2010s. Chin State, like much of Myanmar, has been deeply affected by the Myanmar civil war since it broke out in 2021. Tens of thousands of Chin State residents have fled to neighboring Mizoram, India, and towns such as Thantlang were destroyed in the fighting. Since the war broke out, several armed opposition groups have emerged calling themselves the Chinland Defense Force. The groups are reportedly funded by the Chin diaspora and by the National Unity Government of Myanmar, an opposition government-in-exile. On December 6th, 2023, the Chin National Front ratified the Chinland Constitution, proclaiming the state of Chinland.

Matupi District was formed by the second Pyidaungsu Hluttaw regular meeting on 28 June 2017. Chin State has little infrastructure and remains extremely poor and undeveloped. The people of Chin State are made up of many tribes which, though historically related, now speak divergent languages and have different cultural and historical identities. Some consider the name Chin an exonym, given by the Burmese and of unclear origin. Ethnic groups in Chin State include K' Cho, Zo, Laimi, Matu, Tedim, Mizo, Asho, Mara, Khumi, and Daai, among others. According to the 2014 Myanmar Census, Christians make up the vast majority of Chin State's population, at 85.4%. Minority religious communities include Buddhists (13.0%), Islam (0.1%), Hindus (0.0%), and Animism and other religions (1.5%), including adherents of Pau Cin Hau, who collectively comprise the remainder of Chin State’s population. 1.1% of the population listed no religion, or other religions, or were otherwise not enumerated. Chin State is the only state in Myanmar with a majority Christian population. According to official statistics, Chin State had 25 high schools in 2003.
