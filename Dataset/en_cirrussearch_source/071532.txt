The South Mindanao or Bilic languages are a group of related languages spoken by the Bagobo, Blaan, Tboli, and Teduray peoples of the southern coast of Mindanao Island in the Philippines. They are not part of the Mindanao language family that covers much of the island. The languages are: Blaan Klata Tboli Teduray Though it is typically classified as one of the South Mindanao languages, Klata (Giangan) is alternatively considered by Zorc (2019) to be a primary branch of the Southern Philippine languages, with Bilic being classified as a sister branch. Savage (1986) reconstructs Proto-South-Mindanaon using Tboli, Koronadal Blaan, and Sarangani Blaan data. Teduray and Giangan were not used in Savage's (1986) reconstruction.
