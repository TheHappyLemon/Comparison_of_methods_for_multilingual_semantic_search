Aakenustunturi is a fell in Kittilä in northern Finland. It has an elevation of 570 metres (1,870 ft) and is located near Mount Ylläs. The fell had two fatal airplane crashes during World War II. On 24 February 1943, a Junkers Ju 52 of the German Luftwaffe was shot down and crashed into the fell. Later, during the Lapland War, Air Force Captain Paavo Kahla, a Knight of the Mannerheim Cross and Sergeant Jouko Liinamaa went missing on a reconnaissance flight on October 23, 1944. Their remains were found by a reindeer herder, alongside their shot down Fokker C.X in spring 1945. The fell is considered a wild oasis between the fells in the north and is a popular destination for hikers. In December 2004, the fell was incorporated into the Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park.
