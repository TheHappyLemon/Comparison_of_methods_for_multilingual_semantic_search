In modern times, Bima is the largest regional and economic hub of Eastern Sumbawa with transmigrants from other parts of Indonesia, especially Java, Bali, and Lombok. It has a central downtown commercial zone. It is home to the Sultan Salahuddin mosque and the Sultan Salahuddin Museum (former Bima Sultanate palace). It is connected by a provincial road to Dompu and Sape.

The table also includes the locations of the District administrative centres and the number of administrative villages (all rated as urban kelurahan) in each district, and its post codes. The city is located on the eastern shore of Bima Bay. Traditionally Bima was a port city that connected to other port cities in Eastern Indonesia such as Makassar and Ternate, as well as to ports in Lombok, Bali, and East Java. Bima has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen Aw) with moderate to little rainfall from April to November and heavy rainfall from December to March.

Bima is connected through the trans-Sumbawa road to Sape Harbour in the east and Dompu in the Southwest to Sumbawa Besar and Taliwang in the western part of Sumbawa. Bus services connecting Bima to other neighboring cities in Sumbawa as far as Mataram in Lombok are available. Air transportation is served through Sultan Salahuddin Airport on the southern outskirt of Bima by NAM Air and Wings Air to Lombok, Denpasar, and Makassar. Bima was also a stop on Qantas Airways' pre-war route between Sydney and Singapore, serviced by C Class Empire flying boats. In the Middle Ages, Bima was the easternmost extent of the expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia, as a result of heavy Indian influence on the region during the period. Bima was once one of the four sultanates on the island of Sumbawa. From the 17th to 20th centuries, it was the capital of the Bima Sultanate and is home to an old palace of the city's rulers. In the early 17th century, the Islamization of Bima had fallen off the old Hindu kingdom on the east coast of the island of Sumbawa. In 1792, Sultan Abdu'l Hamid Muhammad Shah signed a contract with the Dutch East India Company, through which Bima became the Protectorate of the Dutch. Bima has several well-known tourist destinations, such as Mount Tambora, Wawo traditional Village, Sambori Traditional Village, Snake Island, Ana Fari Lake (Lake of the Angels), and Satonda Island. There are many white sandy beaches both in the northern and southern parts of Bima. The city has modest tourist accommodations, such as 1-star hotels and some restaurants. Its main attractions are the Sultan Salahuddin mosque, the Terapung mosque, and the Sultan Salahuddin Museum (former Bima Sultanate palace). Bima airport serves as the air hub for domestic and foreign visitors, who are more attracted to visiting Hu'u beach for surfing or Tambora Volcano for hiking.
