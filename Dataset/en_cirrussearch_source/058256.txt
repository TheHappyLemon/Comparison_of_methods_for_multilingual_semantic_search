The House of Normandie (Norman: Maison de Nouormandie [mɛ.zɔ̃ d̪e nɔʁ.mɛnde]) designates the noble family which originates from the Duchy of Normandy and whose members were dukes of Normandy, counts of Rouen, as well as kings of England following the Norman conquest of England. It lasted until Stephen of the French House of Blois seized the English throne and the Duchy of Normandy in 1135.
