January 8, 2020 Controversy arose following Ricky Gervais' opening monologue, which was seen as an attack on the perceived hypocrisy of Hollywood. He joked about several controversial topics, such as the death of Jeffrey Epstein, the college admissions scandal, and the middle-aged Leonardo DiCaprio's attraction to younger women. Gervais also jokingly accused the Hollywood Foreign Press of racism for its lack of diversity in the "in memoriam" section, mocked Amazon, Apple and Disney for their labor practices, and chastised awardees who talk about their political views in acceptance speeches. Gervais' comments attained mixed reactions across the political spectrum; while conservatives highly praised Gervais, journalists from liberal outlets were more critical, with Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield calling his monologue "incredibly stale". Of the criticism, Gervais said it was the "best ever", and later defended his jokes in a tweet. 92nd Academy Awards 47th Annie Awards 25th Critics' Choice Awards 73rd British Academy Film Awards 40th Golden Raspberry Awards 23rd Hollywood Film Awards 35th Independent Spirit Awards 24th Satellite Awards 26th Screen Actors Guild Awards Thorne, Will; Otterson, Joe (January 6, 2020).
