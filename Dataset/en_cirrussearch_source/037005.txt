The 2017 Abu Dhabi Tour was a road cycling stage race that took place between 23 and 26 February. It was the third edition of the Abu Dhabi Tour and was the third event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. It was the first time that the race was included in the UCI World Tour calendar. The race's mountain-top finish at Jebel Hafeet provided the final podium of the race, after Mark Cavendish (Team Dimension Data), Marcel Kittel (Quick-Step Floors) and Caleb Ewan (Orica–Scott) won the three sprint stages. 2013 world champion Rui Costa, riding for the newly renamed UAE Team Emirates, broke away with Team Katusha–Alpecin's Ilnur Zakarin, with the two staying clear to the end; Costa was able to out-sprint Zakarin, and with the additional bonus seconds for winning the stage, Costa held onto the final victory by four seconds. The podium was completed by Team Sunweb rider Tom Dumoulin, who tried to close the pair down on the mountain, but fell ten seconds shy on the stage. With finishes of first, second and third on the sprint stages, Cavendish was a comfortable winner of the points classification. In the other classifications, Kittel's teammate Julian Alaphilippe was the winner of the young rider classification; he gained four places overall on the final day with a three-second time bonus for winning one of the intermediate sprints at the Yas Marina Circuit – moving from ninth to fifth in the process. Another final-day mover was Bora–Hansgrohe's Patrick Konrad, who took the intermediate sprints classification, winning the two other sprints and finishing second to Alaphilippe in the third. With eight bonus seconds, he moved from 24th to 10th overall. The teams classification was won by Costa's UAE Team Emirates.

As such, sixteen of the eighteen WorldTeams – all excluding Cannondale–Drapac and FDJ – competed in the race. Four UCI Professional Continental teams competed, completing the 20-team peloton.
