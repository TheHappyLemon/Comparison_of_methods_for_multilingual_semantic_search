Pokrov (Ukrainian: Покров, IPA: [poˈkrɔu̯] ), formerly Ordzhonikidze (Орджонікідзе) until 2016, is a small city and mining town in Nikopol Raion, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, central Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Pokrov urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Its population is approximately 37,493 (2022 estimate). During the industrialization of the Soviet Union, the development of the mining industry intensified, Ordzhonikidze became a notable mining town in Soviet Ukraine. On 22 October 1938, Ordzhonikidze, named after Sergo Ordzhonikidze, received the urban-type settlement status. In 1971, a large Golden Pectoral was discovered on the site of Tovsta Mohyla near Pokrov by the Ukrainian archaeologist Borys Mozolevskyi. It probably belonged to a Scythian chieftain of the 3rd century BC, but was likely made by Greek artisans of the Crimean peninsula. The city was established in 1956 when several miner settlements of the Ordzhonikidze Mine were merged into a city. Previously, in 1883 a Russian engineer-geologist Valerian Domger discovered rich deposits of manganese ore in a basin of the Solona River [uk]. Since that time, mining towns such as Prychepylivka (today – Hirnytske) started to appear in the area. In 1886, in place of the modern city were created Pokrovski quarries. Pokrov is located on the site of the 17th century Chortomlyk Sich. On 15 May 2015, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a bill into law that started a six months period for the removal of communist monuments and the mandatory renaming of settlements with a name related to Communism. Since 2 April 2016, after it was officially renamed by the Ukrainian parliament, the city is officially named Pokrov. Until 18 July 2020, Pokrov was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and the center of Pokrov Municipality. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to seven. The area of Pokrov Municipality was merged into Nikopol Raion.
