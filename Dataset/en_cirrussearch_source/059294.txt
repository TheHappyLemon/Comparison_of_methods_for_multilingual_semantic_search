Cláudio Ibrahim Vaz Leal (born 4 April 1964), better known as Branco, is Brazilian former footballer who played as a left back. A member of the triumphant Brazilian team in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Branco was a renowned free kick specialist (as was his international successor, Roberto Carlos) known for his accuracy of placing the ball in the direction that he wanted the free kick to go. At club level, Branco played for Internacional (1980–81), Fluminense (1981–86, 1994 and 1998), Brescia (1986–88), FC Porto (1988–91), Genoa (1991–93), Grêmio (1992–94), Flamengo (1995), Corinthians (1995), Middlesbrough (1996), and MetroStars (1997). Branco's late career in England and the United States was marred by weight problems.[citation needed] During his spell at Middlesbrough he scored twice, both goals coming against Hereford in the League Cup second round, once at home in the first leg and once away in the second. However, he played just nine times in the Premier League and by Christmas 1996 he had left the club on a free transfer after less than a year.[citation needed] Branco appeared 72 times for Brazil, between April 1985 and February 1995, and scored nine goals.[citation needed] After sitting out the first four games at the 1994 World Cup, he replaced Leonardo on the left after Leonardo was banned for a deliberate elbow on Tab Ramos in the second-round game against the USA. Branco scored with a memorable late free kick from 35 metres to eliminate the Netherlands in the quarter-finals, and took one of Brazil's penalties in the shootout when they beat Italy in the final. He played in a total of twelve matches in three World Cup tournaments.[citation needed] As of 2006, Branco was the general manager overseeing Brazil national youth teams.[citation needed] From 2007 to December 2009, he worked as general manager of Fluminense youth teams.[citation needed] Internacional Campeonato Gaúcho: 1981 Fluminense Campeonato Brasileiro Série A: 1984 Campeonato Carioca: 1983, 1984, 1985 Porto Primeira Liga: 1989–90 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira: 1990 Grêmio Campeonato Gaúcho: 1993 Brazil FIFA World Cup: 1994 Copa América: 1989 da Cunha, Pedro Jorge.
