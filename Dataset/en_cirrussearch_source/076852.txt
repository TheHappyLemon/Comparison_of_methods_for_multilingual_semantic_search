Daniel Alan David Jones (born 12 March 1986) is an English singer, songwriter and musician who is one of the lead vocalists and the lead guitarist for pop-rock band McFly. Jones's fellow band members are Tom Fletcher (rhythm guitarist and vocals), Dougie Poynter (bass and vocals), and Harry Judd (drums). From 2018, Jones released a handful of solo singles, with his debut EP being released in 2019. He won the February 2024 The Masked Singer finale; he released his version of "It's All Coming Back to Me Now", which peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart. Jones was born and raised in Bolton, Greater Manchester, where his mother runs a hairdressing business. He was educated at Thornleigh Salesian College and, briefly, Haberdashers’ Boys’ School. He and his sister Vicky were interested in music from an early age. In 2014, Vicky took part in the third series of The Voice but was eliminated during the battle round. Jones attended Bury College where he studied for a BTEC National Diploma in music. Their father walked out on the family when Danny was eighteen and it left a lasting impression on him. Not long after, he co-wrote the song "Don't Know Why" (from Wonderland) with Vicky. McFly rose to fame in 2004, partly due to their association with Busted; McFly supported Busted on their A Present for Everyone Tour. Jones met Fletcher when he auditioned for the "boy band" V (he mistakenly perceived V as similar in style to the future Busted). Fletcher, who was filming the auditions for Island Records, later approached Jones. The two conversed and discovered common interests, leading to a songwriting session between Fletcher, Jones and Busted's James Bourne. When they finished writing projects for Busted, Fletcher and Jones began writing for their own, then-unnamed band. They temporarily moved into the InterContinental Hotel in London, United Kingdom (UK). Drummer Judd and bassist Poynter were subsequently recruited through an advertisement placed by Fletcher and Jones in NME magazine. Jones, working with his fellow band members, has co-written all five of McFly's studio albums. He also penned three of his own solo tracks on the first three McFly albums. He has also produced tracks for McFly and other musicians; for example, he produced the song, "Only The Strong Survive", from McFly's fourth studio album "Radio:ACTIVE", as well as his band's cover of Rihanna's "Umbrella". Jones has also been listed as a producer for McFly's 6th studio album, which has still not been released but will soon be according to the band. He has also produced countless demos for his band, alongside Fletcher. Jones also takes the role of lead guitarist in most performances, with Fletcher playing rhythm guitar. He can be seen performing solos in songs such as "That Girl", "I Wanna Hold You", "Everybody Knows", and "Transylvania". The McFly song "The Ballad of Paul K", which he co-wrote with McFly bandmate Dougie Poynter, whose father also left home, was based on both their experiences. As a side project, Jones works on remixes for his band's songs, including "Party Girl" or "Nowhere Left to Run", and "Take Me There". Some remixes can be found as b-sides on singles released from the album Above the Noise. Jones is a music producer and keen DJ. After McFly's direction changed it was announced he would remix "Party Girl" as a b-side of the single after that he remixed "Nowhere Left to Run" for the "That's the Truth" single. After this success Jones played songs such as "Take Me There" or "End of the World" and "IF U C Kate" as well as his other remixes. Jones also works with DJ Roger Sanchez under the name 'The Saturn V'. Jones has toured England as a DJ and is set to release songs called "Gone" and "Around Me" with Sanchez, also a remix of Rihanna's song "We Found Love". Jones produced a bonus track for One Direction on their second album Take Me Home and wrote "Don't Forget Where You Belong" from their third album Midnight Memories. From 2017 to 2023, Jones was featured as a coach on the children's singing competition The Voice Kids UK. Jones released his debut solo single, "Is This Still Love", in 2018. The single peaked at number 44 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart. He released a further five singles from his debut EP, titled EP, in 2019. In 2024, Jones participated in and won the fifth series of The Masked Singer as "Piranha". He released his cover of It's All Coming Back To Me, and instantly topped the iTunes charts, beating singers such as Beyonce.[citation needed] The single debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart on 23 February 2024. In 2024, Jones will be featured as a coach on the upcoming thirteenth series of The Voice UK with Tom Fletcher in a duo chair.
