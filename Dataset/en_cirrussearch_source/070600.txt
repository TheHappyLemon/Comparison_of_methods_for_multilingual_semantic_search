The 2022 European Figure Skating Championships were held from 10 to 16 January 2022 at the Tondiraba Ice Hall in Tallinn, Estonia. Medals were awarded in men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dance. The competition determined the entry quotas for each federation at the 2023 European Championships. Tallinn was announced as the host in June 2019. The city had previously hosted the competition in 2010. The competition was open to skaters from all European member nations of the International Skating Union. The corresponding competition for non-European skaters was the 2022 Four Continents Championships. Skaters were eligible if they turned 15 years of age before 1 July 2021 and met the minimum technical elements score requirements. The ISU accepted scores if they were obtained at senior-level ISU-recognized international competitions during the ongoing season at least 21 days before the first official practice day of the championships or during the two preceding seasons. SP/RD and FS/FD scores may be attained at different events. Normally, the number of entries would be based on the results of the preceding European Championships. However, as the 2021 European Championships had been cancelled, the results of the 2020 European Championships were used instead. If not listed above, one entry is allowed. All times are listed in local time (UTC+02:00). Member nations began announcing their selections in December 2021. The International Skating Union published a complete list of entries on 21 December 2021.
