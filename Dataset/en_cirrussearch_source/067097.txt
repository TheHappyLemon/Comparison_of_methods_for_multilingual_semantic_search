On 25 January 2022, Poland began building a border wall on the border with Belarus to prevent illegal immigration in the aftermath of the Belarus–European Union border crisis. Poland began work on the 5.5-meter (18 foot) high steel wall topped with barbed wire at a cost of around 1.6 billion zł (US$407m) aimed at blocking the passage of illegal migrants during the border crisis in the region artificially instigated by Belarus in the late summer of 2021. The barrier was completed on 30 June 2022. An electronic barrier 206km in length mounting 3,000 cameras with night vision and movement sensors, was added to the fence between November 2022 and early summer 2023 at a cost of EUR 71.8 million. Some media outlets, journalists and celebrities accused the Polish government of using border barrier to prevent entry of irregular asylum seekers. During and after the intense phase of the border crisis, Poland did not close its border crossings with Belarus and did not stop granting asylum. In 2022 1,029 applications were made in Terespol and 1,070 in Podlaskie. Since the fence was built illegal crossings have reduced to a trickle, however between August 2021 and February 2023 37 bodies were found on both sides of the border, people having died mainly from hypothermia or drowning. During 2022 Poland recorded 16,000 attempted crossings of the border. In 2023 the electronic sensors logged 22,000 in the first 8 months.
