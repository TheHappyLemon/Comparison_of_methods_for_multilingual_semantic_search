Lysychansk (/ˌlɪsɪˈtʃænsk/ LIH-sih-CHANSK, /-ˈtʃɑːnsk/ -⁠CHAHNSK; Ukrainian: Лисича́нськ, IPA: [lɪsɪˈtʃɑnʲsʲk] ; Russian: Лисича́нск, romanized: Lisichansk IPA: [lʲɪsʲɪˈtɕansk]), is a city in Sievierodonetsk Raion, Luhansk Oblast, eastern Ukraine. It is located on the high right bank of the Donets River, approximately 115 kilometres (71 mi) from the administrative center of the oblast, Luhansk. It faces Sievierodonetsk across the river. Its population before the Russian invasion of Ukraine was approximately 93,340 (2022 estimate). Prior to Ukrainian 2020 municipal classification reforms, Lysychansk was incorporated as a city of oblast significance. Up to 2022, the administration of Lysychansk Municipality included the settlements of Novodruzhesk and Pryvillia. Along with the cities of Sievierodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna and the nearest towns, the Lysychansk area constituted a major urban and industrial hub of the Donbas region, with a 2009 population of about 353,000. The city became the site of 2022's Battle of Lysychansk, which ended with the capture of the city by Russian forces and the Luhansk People's Republic on 2 July. Up to 12,000 were estimated to have remained in the city, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russia has claimed the city following its declared annexation of the region in September 2022. In 1721, coal was discovered in the Donets basin near Lisya Balka, a Cossack village established in 1710. In 1795, Lysychansk was the first coal-mining settlement of the Donets basin. Earlier settlements in the area around Lysychansk were completely destroyed by the Muscovy punitive expedition against the Bulavin Rebellion. After suppressing the uprising, the area was resettled with Voronove (founded by Khokhlov's Cossacks), Syrotyne (Popov's and Sirotin's Cossacks), Borivske (partly settled by former residents of the burned the Borovskaya Sloboda), Metiolkine (Metelnikov's Cossacks) and Smolianynove (Smolkin's Cossacks).[citation needed] In 1890, a Belgian industralist Ernest Solvay build a soda plant with surrounding infrastructure for the Belgian staff. In 2017 these buildings (a gymnasium, a hospital and a range of residential buildings) won the 'Belgian Heritage Abroad Award'. A local newspaper has been published in the city since January 1918. The Russian Civil War (1918–1920) damaged Lysychansk's industry and economy. In 1920, the Bolsheviks nationalized the mines and plants in Lysychansk. By 1925, the economy recovered, and by the 1930s, industrial growth accelerated. Lysychansk gained city status in 1938. However, this growth was interrupted by Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union and occupation of the city. Lysychansk suffered massive destruction of infrastructure and hundreds of civilian deaths at the hands of the Germans. Throughout the mid-1960s, Lysychansk's borders were changed. In 1962, the city of Sievierodonetsk, which started as a village serving a chemical plant on the outskirts of Lysychansk, branched off from Lysychansk and became its own independent city. In 1963, the towns of Novodruzhesk and Pryvillia were included in the city limits of Lysychansk and became cities.[citation needed] In 1965, Lysychansk incorporated the settlements of Verkhnie and Proletarske. During the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine the town was captured early April 2014 by pro-Russian separatists. It remained under control of separatists for three months, until 22 July 2014 Ukrainian Ukrinform reported that the separatists "massively left Lysychansk" with "seized cars from the population and in parking lots;" Russian ITAR-TASS reported the same day that the separatists had "decided to leave the town in order to save the population and stop clashes." This was mainly because their defeat in the Siege of Sloviansk and the evacuation of Kramatorsk made holding the city untenable. The next day, heavy fighting continued around the town while the Ukrainian National Guard and the Ukrainian army released a statement that stated "the military plan to free Lysychansk, Luhansk region, from terrorist groups in the near future." On 24 July 2014 the Ukrainian army claimed its troops had entered Lysychansk and its Col. Andriy Lysenko stated "We will take the town, and the road will be open to Horlivka, then Donetsk." On 25 July 2014, Ukrainian forces secured the city from the pro-Russian separatists. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lysychansk came under heavy shelling from the Russian military. Some of the most intense strikes occurred late in March 2022, which destroyed dozens of buildings and caused civilian casualties. On 9 May 2022, Russian troops attempted to cross over the Seversky Donets river with a temporary pontoon bridge near Bilohorivka. Ukrainian forces anticipated this approach, monitored the bridge construction, bombing the bridge and Russian vehicles who already crossed resulting in severe Russian losses. Russia made several such attempts, many of which were neutralized by Ukrainian forces. After the Russian capture of Sievierodenetsk, Lysychansk became the last major city in the Luhansk region under Ukrainian control. On 26 June, TASS reported that Russian forces entered the city from five directions. On 27 June, the CNN reported that civilians in Lysychansk have been urged to leave immediately, as Russian forces gain ground in the city. On 2 July 2022, reports of Ukrainian troops withdrawing from the city and Russian forces moving in were supported by multiple videos from Kadirov's 141st Special Motorized Regiment declaring victory in front of the City Council of Lysychansk. "After heavy fighting for Lysychansk, the defence forces of Ukraine were forced to withdraw from their occupied positions and lines," the army general staff said. Earlier Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said his forces had captured Lysychansk and taken full control of Luhansk region. Ukraine's troops were outgunned there. Its general staff said that "in order to preserve the lives of Ukrainian defenders, a decision was made to withdraw". (BBC 4 July 2022) On 19 September 2022, Ukrainian troops recaptured Bilohorivka, a village 10km from the city. Lysychansk is located in the North-Western part of the Luhansk region, 115 km from Luhansk, on the high right bank of the Siverskyi Donets River.

Lysychansk has a central railway station and three other railway stations: Nasvitevych, Pereizna, Volcheiarska. Almost all transit distance trains stop at Stations Pereizna and Volcheiarska, allowing residents of Southern Lysychansk not to be dependent on the central railway station (not actual from 2014). As of 2021, the non-central stations are only used for short-destination interurban trains (diesel commuter trains). Lysychansk Central Railway Station has the following train routes: 138 – Khmelnytskyi – Lysychansk 20 – Kyiv – Popasna 46 – Lysychansk – Uzhhorod Since the Russo-Ukrainian War, there is no railway route available from Luhanska Oblast to Russian Federation. In most cases, Lysychansk Central Railway Station became the final destination for long-destination trains.[citation needed] The nearest airport is located 12 kilometers from the city center, located in Sievierodonetsk. Built in 1968 the airport is to serve residents and workers of the surrounding cities. The airport is administered by the Lysychansk District pipeline OAO Ukrtransnafta.
