MŠK Žilina (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈem ˈeʂ ˈkaː ˈʐilina])[wrong stress] is a Slovak football club based in the town of Žilina, that is playing in the Slovak Superliga. Since the league inception in 1993, the club has won 7 titles and comes second in All-time table that makes them one of the most successful teams in the competition. The club and their supporters alike are nicknamed Šošoni (after the Shoshone Native American tribe) and play their home games in the Štadión pod Dubňom. In the 2016–17 season, Žilina won the Slovak League. The club was founded towards the end of 1908 under the Hungarian name Zsolnai Testgyakorlók Köre, and was officially registered on 20 June 1909. The club won its first Slovak championship (Zväzové majstrovstvá Slovenska) in 1928 followed by another in 1929.[citation needed] In total, Žilina played 30 out of 47 seasons in the Czechoslovak First League spanning from 1945 to 1993 and come 13th in all-time table. The most successful season remains 1946–47 when they clinched 4th place.[citation needed] Many consider 1961 a milestone in club's history. Firstly, the team reached the final of the National Cup, where they lost to Dukla Prague, the eventual Czechoslovak champion. Despite the defeat, for the first time in its history the club, then known as Dynamo Žilina, broke into Europe to contest in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. Notable 3–2 and 1–0 victories over Olympiacos moved them in quarter-finals, however the ambitious Slovak team was ultimately knocked out by the previous year's winner Fiorentina. Although Žilina grabbed a promising 3–2 victory at home, Fiorentina went through by winning the second leg 2–0.[citation needed] Quarter-Finals 21 February 1962 Žilina 27 February 1962 Florence Fiorentina won 4–3 on aggregate. In the late 1960s the club was renamed TJ ZVL Žilina and participated in the Intertoto Cup for several years, winning the group in 1969 and coming 2nd a year later. In 1973–74 they reached the final of the Mitropa Cup but they were defeated by Tatabányai Bányász 5–2 on aggregate. Between 1972 and 1974, they finished 5th in the First Division of the Czechoslovak League for three years running, followed by relegation to the Second Division in the 1978–79 season. The club bounced back four years later and finished second in the Mitropa Cup.[citation needed] Following dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, MŠK Žilina has been playing in the Slovak Superliga for the total of 23 seasons with the exception of 1995–96 season after relegation to the Second Division.[citation needed] In the autumn of 2000, former Czechoslovakian defender Ladislav Jurkemik joined the club as a new manager. After his departure halfway through the 2001–02 season the club appointed Czech coach Leoš Kalvoda. During his short reign at the club he led them to win their first title. In the 2002–03 season, now under the management of Milan Lešický, the club succeeded in retaining the title.[citation needed] Ladislav Jurkemik was reappointed as a manager during the 2003–04 season. He led the defending champions to 10 priceless consecutive victories to clinch the third successive title though narrowly on a goal difference. After Slovan Bratislava, MŠK Žilina became only the second club to win three Slovakian titles. The team's performances in next two seasons faded while they lacked the quality they had been famous for during their winning campaigns. In pursuit of silverware numerous players were signed over next two years. In the span of only fourteen months, three managers; the reputable Karol Pecze, his successor Milan Nemec and eventually Marijan Vlak were in charge over the team. Since the results and performances never met the expectations, Vlak ended his reign immediately at the end of 2005–06 season after they failed to reach UEFA Cup spot only to finish fourth.[citation needed] They played in the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, reaching the group stages where they beat Aston Villa 2–1 at Villa Park.[citation needed] Former Czechoslovakia and later Czech international Pavel Hapal was appointed new manager before 2009–10 campaign. In his first season, he led the team to win a league title, their fifth in nine years. Arguably the greatest success in their history came by making a debut in 2010–11 UEFA Champions League group stage after eliminating Sparta Prague in play-off round. In the following season they completed their first ever double, while the 2012–13 season saw the team finishing 7th – their worst league position since 2000. However, as a defeated finalists of the Slovak Cup the club secured a place to contest in the 1st qualifying round of 2013–14 UEFA Europa League.[citation needed] 1909 – Founded as Zsolnai Testgyakorlók Köre 1910 – Renamed ZsTS Zsolna 1919 – Renamed SK Žilina 1948 – Renamed Sokol Slovena Žilina 1953 – Renamed Jiskra Slovena Žilina 1956 – Renamed DSO Dynamo Žilina 1961 – First European qualification, 1961–62 1963 – Renamed Jednota Žilina 1967 – Renamed TJ ZVL Žilina 1990 – Renamed ŠK Žilina 1995 – Renamed MŠK Žilina The following clubs are currently affiliated with MŠK Žilina: Tatran Liptovský Mikuláš (2012–present) MŠK Námestovo (TBA–present) Baník Prievidza (2013–present) JUPIE Futbalová škola Mareka Hamšíka (2016–present) MŠK Žilina Africa FC (2018–present) MŠK Žilina supporters are called Žilinskí Šošoni (Žilina Shoshones), North Brigade and Žilinskí Fanatici (Žilina Fanatics).
