The Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR (Russian: Спартакиада народов СССР, Spartakiada narodov SSSR) were mass multi-event competitions in the Soviet Union in 1956–1991, descendants of the 1928 All-Union Spartakiad that took place in Moscow. The competitions were designed to be conducted between constituent union republics of the Soviet Union, however one republic Russian SFSR was always represented by three teams, Russian SFSR along with separate teams from Moscow and Leningrad. The Moscow team was the most successful performer at the Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR. Summer editions were always held in Moscow and winter editions held four times in Sverdlovsk, twice in Krasnoyarsk and once in Kiev. There were ten summer Spartakiads and seven winter Spartakiads. In 1952, the Soviet Union decided to join the Olympic movement, and international Spartakiads ceased. However, the term continued to exist for internal sports events in the Soviet Union of different levels, from local up to the Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR. The latter event was held twice in four years: Winter Spartakiad and Summer Spartakiad. The first Soviet Spartakiad was held in 1956. Until 1975, all summer finals were held in Moscow, later in some other cities throughout the Soviet Union (though most events were still held in Moscow). The winter finals were often held in Sverdlovsk.
