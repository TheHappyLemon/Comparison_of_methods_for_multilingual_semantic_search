Canoeing at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro was contested in two main disciplines: canoe slalom, from 7 to 11 August, and canoe sprint, from 15 to 20 August. The slalom competition was held at the Olympic Whitewater Stadium; whereas the sprint events were staged at Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas in Copacabana. The location for canoeing events was a source of concern for athletes since the Brazilian federal government's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation lab has found the genes of drug-resistant super bacteria in Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon. Around 330 athletes participated in 16 events. A new qualification system had been created for both slalom and sprint canoeing at the 2016 Olympic Games. The quotas were set for each event by the International Canoe Federation in August 2014.  Argentina (10)  Australia (18)  Austria (2)  Azerbaijan (4)  Belarus (12)  Belgium (1)  Brazil (13)  Bulgaria (2)  Canada (9)  China (10)  Cook Islands (2)  Cuba (6)  Czech Republic (12)  Denmark (5)  Ecuador (1)  Egypt (2)  France (17)  Georgia (1)  Germany (16)  Great Britain (11)  Hungary (18)  Italy (4)  Japan (5)  Kazakhstan (13)  Latvia (2)  Lebanon (1)  Lithuania (6)  Moldova (1)  Morocco (1)  Mexico (1)  Mozambique (2)  New Zealand (9)  Nigeria (1)  Palau (1)  Poland (15)  Portugal (7)  Romania (8)  Russia (19)  Samoa (1)  São Tomé and Príncipe (1)  Senegal (3)  Serbia (10)  Slovakia (12)  Slovenia (6)  South Africa (1)  South Korea (2)  Spain (11)  Sweden (5)  Tunisia (3)  Turkey (1)  Ukraine (9)  United States (5)  Uzbekistan (4) Men Men's C-1 1000 metres Serghei Tarnovschi of Moldova finished third, but was stripped of his bronze medal due to a failed doping test.

Reuters. 11 June 2016. The second new study, by the Brazilian federal government's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation lab, which will be published next month by the American Society for Microbiology, found the genes of super bacteria in the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon in the heart of Rio and in a river that empties into Guanabara Bay. Waste from countless hospitals, in addition to hundreds of thousands of households, pours into storm drains, rivers and streams crisscrossing Rio, allowing the super bacteria to spread outside the city's hospitals in recent years. "Scientists reportedly find super bacteria in several Rio Olympic venues". Fox News. 11 June 2016. A 2014 study had already shown the presence of super bacteria off one of the beaches in Guanabara Bay, where sailing and wind-surfing events are going to be held. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has already declared super bacteria an urgent public health crisis. "Rio 2016 – ICF Canoe & Kayak Qualification System" (PDF). ICF.
