The 1995 King Fahd Cup (Arabic: كأس الملك فهد) was the second and last tournament held under the King Fahd Cup name before the competition was retroactively sanctioned by FIFA and recognized as FIFA Confederations Cup. Disputed as the King Fahd Cup, in honor of the then Saudi ruler who organized the tournament with his country's federation (thus in the form of an unofficial tournament), it was hosted by Saudi Arabia in January 1995. It was won by Denmark, who beat defending champions Argentina 2–0 in the final. All matches were played at the 67,000-capacity King Fahd II Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
