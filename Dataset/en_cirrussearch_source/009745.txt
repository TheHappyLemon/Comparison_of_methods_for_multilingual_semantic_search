.tc is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Turks and Caicos Islands. Since T.C. also stands for Türkiye Cumhuriyeti (Republic of Turkey), the domain is used by some Turkish sites as well. The .tc TLD was registered in January 1997. In addition to the direct .tc domains offered by the registry, there is also a small range of second-level domains that a client can register under: .com.tc .net.tc .org.tc .pro.tc Caribbean portal Internet in the Turks and Caicos Islands Internet in the United Kingdom .uk "IANA — .tc Domain Delegation Data". www.iana.org.
