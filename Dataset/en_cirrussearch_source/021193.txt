Zschopau (German pronunciation: [ˈtʃoːpaʊ]), is a town in the Erzgebirgskreis district of Saxony, Germany. The town is located on the northwestern slopes of the Ore Mountains, on both banks of the Zschopau River, about 9 miles (14 km) south-east from Chemnitz. The highest point is Mt. Pilzhübel with an elevation of 597.8 m (1,961 ft). The municipal area comprises the village of Krumhermersdorf, incorporated in 1999. Since German reunification, Zschopau has lost about one fourth of its population.
