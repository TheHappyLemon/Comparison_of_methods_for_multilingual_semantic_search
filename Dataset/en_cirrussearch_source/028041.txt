The Carpathian winds that flow into the Rožnov Furrow dispel the fog and keep the weather in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm sunny for most of the year. The first written mention of Rožnov is from 1267. The village was founded during the colonization by Bruno von Schauenburg between 1246 and 1267, however, there is a possibility that there was already a small settlement that was only expanded. The castle on the Hradisko hill above Rožnov is first documented in 1310. In 1411, Rožnov was first referred to as a town. After the town was owned by several noble families, including lords of Kravaře, lords of Cimburk, it was acquired by the Zierotin family in 1548, who owned it until the 19th century. During their rule Rožnov economically developed. The glass-making and weaving became important in the town. Rožnov was known throughout the whole Habsburg monarchy for weaving linen and muslin. Local embroidery also gained fame. However, the inhabitants otherwise subsisted mainly on agriculture and pastoralism. For a long time, the town consisted only of wooden buildings and slowly transformed into stone ones. In 1796, a favorable healing effect of the local specific climate has been discovered. A climatic spa was founded in Rožnov in 1820. The spa history ended with the advent of World War II. The I/35 road (part of the European route E442) from Valašské Meziříčí to the Czech-Slovak border passes through the town.
