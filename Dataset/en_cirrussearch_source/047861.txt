Domantas Sabonis (Lithuanian pronunciation: [ˈsaːboːnʲɪs]; born May 3, 1996) is a Lithuanian-American professional basketball player for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Lithuanian national team. Son of the Hall of Fame player Arvydas Sabonis, Sabonis is an All-NBA Team member and three-time NBA All-Star. Sabonis started his career in Spain with Unicaja Málaga. He then moved to the United States and played college basketball for the Gonzaga Bulldogs. After being drafted 11th overall in the 2016 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic, Sabonis was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder on draft night, spending his rookie season with the team before being traded to the Indiana Pacers in 2017. He played five seasons for the Pacers and was named an All-Star twice during his tenure. In 2022, Sabonis was traded to the Sacramento Kings for rising star Tyrese Haliburton, in a move considered shocking to many. Named to his first All-NBA team and third All-Star selection in 2023, he led the Kings alongside De'Aaron Fox to the third seed and helped them break their NBA record 17-year playoff drought. Domantas was born on May 3, 1996, in Portland, Oregon, when his father, Arvydas Sabonis, was playing for the Portland Trail Blazers. His mother is Ingrida Mikelionytė, the first Miss Lithuania in 1988. He has two older brothers, Žygis (born 1991) and Tautvydas (born 1992), and a younger sister, Aušrinė (born 1997). When Arvydas was once asked if any of his sons will follow his footsteps in basketball, he singled out Domantas due to his stubbornness, and because he is left-handed. In 2004, Domantas' father retired from basketball, and the whole family moved from Portland to Málaga, Spain. I like a lot of things about his game. He is extremely aggressive, plays with a motor, is always going hard. Really high level rebounder, great passer, physical player, and runs and moves exceptionally well for a big guy. —Mark Few, Gonzaga head coach.
