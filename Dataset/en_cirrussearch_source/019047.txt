MikroMikko was a Finnish line of microcomputers released by Nokia Corporation's computer division Nokia Data from 1981 through 1987. MikroMikko was Nokia Data's attempt to enter the business computer market. They were especially designed for good ergonomy. The first model in the line, MikroMikko 1, was released on 29 September 1981, 48 days after IBM introduced its Personal Computer. The launch date of MikroMikko 1 is the name day of Mikko in the Finnish almanac. The MikroMikko line was manufactured in a factory in the Kilo district of Espoo, Finland, where computers had been produced since the 1960s. Nokia later bought the computer division of the Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson. During Finland's economic depression in the early 1990s, Nokia streamlined many of its operations and sold many of its less profitable divisions to concentrate on its key competence of telecommunications. Nokia's personal computer division was sold to the British computer company ICL (International Computers Limited) in 1991, which later became part of Fujitsu. However, ICL and later Fujitsu retained the MikroMikko trademark in Finland. Internationally the MikroMikko line was marketed by Fujitsu under the trademark ErgoPro. Fujitsu later transferred its personal computer operations to Fujitsu Siemens Computers, which shut down its only factory in Espoo at the end of March 2000, thus ending large-scale PC manufacturing in the country.
