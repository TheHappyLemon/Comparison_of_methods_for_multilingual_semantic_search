Jaroslav Janus (born 21 September 1989) is a Slovak professional ice hockey goaltender. He is currently playing for HC Košice of the Slovak Extraliga. Janus was selected by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 6th round (162nd overall) of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. As a youth, Janus played in his native Slovakia, within the junior program of HC Slovan Bratislava. After his selection to the Lightning in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, Janus opted to continue his development in North America, playing major junior hockey with the Erie Otters of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). On December 31, 2009, the Tampa Bay Lightning signed Janus to a three-year, entry-level contract. Janus made his professional debut with the Lightning's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals, in the 2009–10 season. Janus claimed the Calder Cup, as the backup with the Admirals in the 2011–12 season, but upon being unable to earn an NHL recall through the duration of his rookie contract with the Lightning he opted to return as a restricted free agent to his original club, HC Slovan Bratislava of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on September 8, 2012. As a member of Team Slovakia, Janus competed at the 2009 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships where he was named to the IIHF World U20 Championship All-Star Team.
