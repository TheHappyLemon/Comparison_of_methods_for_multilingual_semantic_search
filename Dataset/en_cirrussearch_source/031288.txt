Daniel Harrwitz (22 February 1821 – 2 January 1884) was a German chess master. Harrwitz was born in Breslau (Wrocław) in the Prussian Province of Silesia. Harrwitz's correct birth and death dates (22 February 1821 and 2 January 1884 respectively) were established by Luca D'Ambrosio in Chess Notes item 6286. He established his reputation in Paris, particularly as a player of blindfold games. He lost a match in England to Howard Staunton in 1846 at odds of a pawn and two moves, and drew a match with Adolf Anderssen in Germany in 1848. Harrwitz lived in England from 1849, and founded the British Chess Review. In 1856, he moved to Paris, where he won a match against Jules Arnous de Rivière. In 1858, he played a match against Paul Morphy in Paris. Harrwitz won the first two games, but lost the match 5½-2½. Harrwitz withdrew from the match, allegedly on grounds of ill health. He subsequently retired to the Austro-Hungarian county of Tyrol, dying in Bolzano in 1884. This section uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves. Although he had a negative record against Morphy, he was one of a few masters who beat Morphy with the black pieces.
