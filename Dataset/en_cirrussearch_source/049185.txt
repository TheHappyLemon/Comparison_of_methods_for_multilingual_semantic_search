Ferland Sinna Mendy (born 8 June 1995) is a French professional footballer who plays as a left-back for La Liga club Real Madrid and the France national team. Mendy was born in Meulan-en-Yvelines, and grew up in Ecquevilly, in the western suburbs of Paris. He is of Senegalese and Bissau-Guinean descent. He acquired French nationality on 16 January 2007, through the collective effect of his parents' naturalization. He is a cousin of goalkeeper Édouard Mendy, who plays for Saudi Professional League club Al-Ahli and the Senegal national team. At the age of 15 he spent time in a wheelchair and was told he might never play football again. During the 2016–17 Ligue 2 season, Mendy made 35 appearances for Le Havre. Mendy signed for Ligue 1 club Lyon on 29 June 2017 on a five-year contract. The transfer fee paid to Le Havre was reported as €5 million plus a possible €1 million in bonuses. On 19 September 2018, he made his Champions League debut in a 2–1 away win over Manchester City in the 2018–19 season. On 12 June 2019, Mendy signed for La Liga club Real Madrid on a six-year contract for an initial fee of €48 million, potentially rising to €53 million with add-ons. He made his debut on 1 September 2019, starting in a 2–2 draw at Villarreal. His first goal came on 13 July 2020, in a 2–1 victory over Granada. During the league season he appeared in 25 matches, as Real Madrid won the 2019–20 La Liga. On 24 February 2021, he scored his first Champions League goal in a 1–0 away win over Atalanta in the 2020–21 season round of 16. In the 2021–22 Champions League semi-final second leg, he made a goal-line clearance to prevent Manchester City's Jack Grealish from scoring in the 87th minute and keep the score at 0–1. However, Real Madrid managed to turn the tie by late goals and extra-time to win 3–1 (6–5 on aggregate) and reach the final. In November 2018, Mendy was called up into the French senior team for the first time after the injury-enforced withdrawal of Benjamin Mendy (no relation) for the matches against Netherlands and Uruguay. He made his debut against the latter playing all 90 minutes of a 1–0 home win.
