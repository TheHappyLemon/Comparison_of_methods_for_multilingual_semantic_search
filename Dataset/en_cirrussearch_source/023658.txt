Novolukoml (Belarusian: Новалукомль, romanized: Novalukomĺ; Russian: Новолукомль; Polish: Nowołukoml) is a town in Chashniki District, Vitebsk Region, Belarus. It is situated by Lake Lukomlskoye. Lukoml Power Station is located in the town. As of 2023, it has a population of 12,048. The history of Novolukoml goes back to 1964 when the construction of the Lukoml power station began. The settlement by the name of Pionerny (Russian: Пионерный) was a temporary place of residence for the builders and the personnel of this natural gas-fired thermal power station. In 1965 the settlement was renamed Novolukoml (lit. "New Lukoml") after the adjacent village of Lukoml which was said to be the center of a principality centuries ago. When the station was finished, the settlement grew steadily and was given the status of a city in 1970. In 2006 the city was granted a coat of arms.
