The World Athletics Indoor Championships are a biennial indoor track and field competition served as the global championship for that version of the sport. Organised by the World Athletics, the competition was inaugurated as the World Indoor Games in 1985 in Paris, France and were subsequently renamed to IAAF World Indoor Championships in 1987. The current name was adapted with the name change of the sports governing body in 2019. They have been held every two years except for when they were held in consecutive years 2003 and 2004 to facilitate the need for them to be held in alternate years to the main World Athletics Championships (outdoors) in the future.   Cancelled due to COVID-19 and postponed to a later year The events held have remained more or less the same since they originated, with the main alterations coming in the earlier years. The 4 x 400 m relay race for both men and women was added to the full schedule in 1991 with the women's triple jump, the latter as an exhibition event, and gaining full status at the following championships. Racewalking events were dropped after 1993, and a 1600 m medley relay was tried but was discontinued were due to poor interest. This same year, a men's heptathlon and women's pentathlon were successfully introduced as non-championship events, and have remained on the program since. In 1997 the women's pole vault entered the fray, two years before it made an appearance at the event's outdoor counterpart. Despite the event's popularity, the 200 m was removed from the program after the 2004 championships, as the event was deemed unfair and too predictable, with the tight bends involved in the race meaning any athletes not drawn in either of the outside lanes had minimal or no chance of winning. Mozambique's Maria de Lurdes Mutola won seven gold, one silver and one bronze medal in the women's 800 m from 1993 to 2008. Natalya Nazarova has won seven gold and one silver medal from 1999 to 2008 in the 400 m and 4 × 400 m relay. Iván Pedroso of Cuba won five straight golds in the men's long jump from 1993 to 2001. Stefka Kostadinova of Bulgaria won five gold medals in the women's high jump. Genzebe Dibaba of Ethiopia won 2 gold medals in the women's 1,500m and 3 gold medals in the 3,000m from 2012 to 2018 Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia won three golds in the 3,000 m and one in the 1,500 m. Sergey Bubka won four pole vault gold medals (three while competing for the Soviet Union and one for Ukraine). Javier Sotomayor of Cuba won four gold and one bronze medal in the men's high jump. Stefan Holm of Sweden has won four gold medals in the men's high jump. Meseret Defar of Ethiopia has won four gold, one silver and one bronze medal in the women's 3,000 m.
