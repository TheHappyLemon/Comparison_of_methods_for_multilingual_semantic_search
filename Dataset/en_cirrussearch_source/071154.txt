The Eternal Daughter premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival on 6 September 2022, and was released in the United States on 2 December 2022 by A24. Middle-aged filmmaker Julie takes her elderly mother, Rosalind, to a secluded and seemingly empty hotel. Julie's father has recently died and Julie wants to spend time with her mother in the hopes of making a film about her. Shrouded in an eerie fog, the hotel is a former family home of Rosalind's and she recounts painful memories that occurred at the location, including a miscarriage and the death of a family member during World War II. Julie begins to regret dredging up these memories but Rosalind assures her that it's not her fault and she has had happy memories at the childhood home as well. One night, Julie walks into her room to find her mother's dog gone. She searches the grounds frantically, enlisting the help of Bill, a hotel employee. Rosalind returns to the room and finds the dog sitting on the bed. She thanks Bill for his help and they share a drink as they bond over their shared grief—Julie's father and Bill's wife, who has also died recently. The following day, Julie overhears Rosalind talking with Bill. Rosalind says she feels sorry for Julie because she has no children of her own and dotes on her mother instead. On Rosalind's birthday, Julie prepares a special supper for her, but when Rosalind says she is not hungry, Julie breaks down. She feels she cannot be happy when her mother is not happy and that she fears for the future as she has no children to take care of her when she is older. While bringing her mother a birthday cake, she cries and it is revealed that she is alone at the table and that her mother died in the past. The following day, Julie works on her screenplay and then prepares to depart. As she leaves the hotel it is revealed to be full of guests and staff. The receptionist seems visibly concerned for Julie, who with the help of Bill gets into a taxi. The fog around the hotel gradually clears.
