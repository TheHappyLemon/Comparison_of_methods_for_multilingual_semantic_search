The Fédération aéronautique internationale (French: [fedeʁɑsjɔ̃ aeʁɔnotik ɛ̃tɛʁnasjɔnal]; FAI; English: World Air Sports Federation) is the world governing body for air sports, and also stewards definitions regarding human spaceflight. It was founded on 14 October 1905, and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland. It maintains world records for aeronautical activities, including ballooning, aeromodeling, and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), as well as flights into space. The FAI was founded at a conference held in Paris 12–14 October 1905, which was organized following a resolution passed by the Olympic Congress held in Brussels on 10 June 1905 calling for the creation of an Association "to regulate the sport of flying, ... the various aviation meetings and advance the science and sport of Aeronautics." The conference was attended by representatives from 8 countries: Belgium (Aéro Club Royal de Belgique, founded 1901), France (Aéro-Club de France, 1898), Germany (Deutscher Luftschiffer Verband aka "German Airship League", founded 1902), Great Britain (Royal Aero Club, 1901), Italy (Aero Club d'Italia [it], 1904), Spain (Real Aero Club de España [es], 1905), Switzerland (Aero-Club der Schweiz, 1900) and the United States (Aero Club of America, 1905). On 2 February 2017 the FAI announced its new strategic partnership with international asset management firm Noosphere Ventures. FAI Secretary General Susanne Schödel, FAI President Frits Brink and Noosphere Ventures Managing Partner Max Polyakov signed the agreement, making Noosphere Ventures FAI's Global Technical Partner. The FAI suspended Russia and Belarus due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, as a result of which pilots from Russia and Belarus will not be able to compete in any FAI-sanctioned event in the 13 FAI air sports disciplines, including paragliding, hang gliding, and paramotoring. The 117th FAI General Conference took place in Dayton, Ohio, US (the 'Birthplace of Aviation') on 26 and 27 October 2023. The 118th FAI General Conference will be held from 20 to 21 November 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 13 Sports: Aeromodelling (modelling (space modulation) – Space Modelling) Amateur-Built & Experimental Aircraft Ballooning Drones General Aviation Gliding Hang Gliding Microlights and Paramotors Paragliding Powered and glider aircraft Aerobatics Rotorcraft Parachuting (Skydiving) Space General Air Sports (CASI) Aerobatics (CIVA) Aeromodelling (CIAM) Amateur-Built and Experimental Aircraft (CIACA) Astronautic Records (ICARE) Ballooning (CIA) General Aviation (GAC) Gliding (IGC) Hang Gliding and Paragliding (CIVL) Microlight and Paramotor (CIMA) Rotorcraft (CIG) Skydiving (ISC) World Air Games World Paragliding Championships World Gliding Championships World Parachuting Championships FAI World Aerobatic Championships World Hot Air Ballooning Championships FAI World Paramotor Slalom Championships 2023 FAI F3P World Championships World Cup of Indoor Skydiving FAI World Grand Prix Red Bull Air Race World Championship Parachuting (Skydiving) All the events sanctioned by the FAI are listed in the events calendar.

Where these are air sports, the FAI also oversees international competitions at world and continental levels, and also organizes the World Air Games and FAI World Grand Prix. The FAI organises the FAI International Drones Conference and Expo. This event offers a platform for organisations, businesses and individuals to discuss how drones are used today and to create a framework for how they will be used and impact on life in the future. The FAI also keeps records set in human spaceflight, through the FAI Astronautic Records Commission (International Astronautic Records Commission – ICARE) The FAI defines the limit between Earth's atmosphere and outer space, the so-called Karman Line, as the altitude of 100 kilometres (62 miles; 330,000 feet) above Earth's sea level. Among the FAI's responsibilities are the verification of record-breaking flights. For a flight to be registered as a "World Record," it has to comply with the FAI's strict rules, which include a proviso that the record must exceed the previous record by a certain percentage. Since the late 1930s, military aircraft have dominated some classes of record for powered aircraft such as speed, distance, payload, and height, though other classes are regularly claimed by civilians. Some records are claimed by countries as their own, even though their achievements fail to meet FAI standards. These claims are not typically granted the status of official records. For example, Yuri Gagarin earned recognition for the first manned spaceflight, despite failing to meet FAI requirements. The FAI initially did not recognize the achievement because he did not land in his Vostok spacecraft (he ejected from it), but later it recognized that Gagarin was the first human to fly into space. The FAI then established the Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal, which has been awarded since 1968. The following types of craft have records: Class A Free Balloons Class B Airships Class C Aeroplanes Class CS Solar-Powered Aeroplanes Class D Gliders & Motorgliders Class E Rotorcraft Class F Model Aircraft Class F1 – Free flight Class F2 – Control line Class F3 – Radio control F3K – Discus Launch Glider F3F – Slope Soaring Class F4 – Scale model aircraft Class F5 – Electrically powered model aircraft F5B – Electric powered motor gliders F5D – Electric powered pylon racing model aircraft Class F8 – Autonomous flight (created by CIAM in 2006, later retired) Class F9 – Drone Sports F9A – Drone soccer F9U – Drone racing Class G Parachuting Class H Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) Aeroplanes Class I Manpowered aircraft Class K Spacecraft Class M Tilt-Wing/Tilt Engine Aircraft Class N Short Take-off and Landing (STOL) Aeroplanes Class O Hang Gliding & Paragliding Class P Aerospacecraft Class R Microlights and Paramotors Class S Space Models (Model rockets) Class U Unmanned aerial vehicles The FAI Gold Air Medal was established in 1924 and was first awarded in 1925. It is reserved for those who have contributed greatly to the development of aeronautics by their activities, work, achievements, initiative or devotion to the cause of Aviation. The FAI has also awarded the Paul Tissandier Diploma since 1952 to those who have served the cause of aviation in general and sporting aviation in particular. The FAI also makes awards for each of the following air sports.
