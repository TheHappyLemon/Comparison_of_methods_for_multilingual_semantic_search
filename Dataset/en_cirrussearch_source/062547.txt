In the final pool of eight fencers Flesch won four of his seven matches to finish in third place for the bronze medal, thus becoming the first Jewish fencer to win an Olympic medal. He returned to Olympic competition at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, now aged 36 years old he again participated in the sabre event. In his first round he won his pool after winning all five match ups, however in the second pool of matches he could only win one against the other four fencers in his pool so was eliminated and was ranked 24th overall in the event.
