The UEFA European Futsal Championship is the main futsal competition of the men's national futsal teams governed by UEFA (the Union of European Football Associations). The first tournament was held in Spain in 1996 and featured only six teams. The tournament was expanded to eight teams in 1999 and held every two years, and further to 12 teams in 2010. After 2018, the tournament was expanded to 16 teams and held every four years, to avoid leap years when the FIFA Futsal World Cup is being played. The first 16-team tournament was held in 2022 in the Netherlands. 1996 UEFA Futsal Championship qualifying (Link) 1999 UEFA Futsal Championship qualifying (Link) 2001 UEFA Futsal Championship qualifying (Link) 2003 UEFA Futsal Championship qualifying (Link) 2005 UEFA Futsal Championship qualifying (Link) 2007 UEFA Futsal Championship qualifying (Link) 2010 UEFA Futsal Championship qualifying UEFA Futsal Euro 2012 qualifying UEFA Futsal Euro 2014 qualifying UEFA Futsal Euro 2016 qualifying UEFA Futsal Euro 2018 qualifying UEFA Futsal Euro 2022 qualifying UEFA Futsal Euro 2026 qualifying * = hosts Legend 1st – Champions 2nd – Runners-up 3rd – Third place 4th – Fourth place SF – Semi-finalists 5th–8th – Fifth to Eighth place 9th–12th – Ninth to Twelfth place Q – Qualified for upcoming tournament  ••  — Qualified but withdrew  •  — Did not qualify  ×  — Did not enter  ×  – Withdrew from the European Championship / Banned / Entry not accepted by FIFA — Country not affiliated to UEFA at that time — Country did not exist or national team was inactive    — Hosts Legend 1st – Champions 2nd – Runners-up 3rd – Third place 4th – Fourth place QF – Quarterfinals R2 – Round 2 (1989–2008, second group stage, top 8; 2012–present: knockout round of 16) R1 – Round 1      – Hosts    – Not an UEFA member Q – Qualified for upcoming tournament UEFA Women's Futsal Championship UEFA Under-21 Futsal Championship UEFA Under-19 Futsal Championship Futsal Finalissima UEFA Futsal Champions League Futsal European Clubs Championship European Futsal Cup Winners Cup European Women's Futsal Tournament European Universities Futsal Championships UEFS Futsal Men's Championship UEFS Futsal Women's Championship "Regulations of the UEFA European Futsal Championship 2020-22" (PDF).
