"Flower of Scotland" (Scottish Gaelic: Flùr na h-Alba, Scots: Flouer o Scotland) is a Scottish song, frequently performed on special occasions and at sporting events as the unofficial National anthem of Scotland. The song was composed in the mid-1960s by Roy Williamson of the folk group the Corries. It was first heard publicly in a 1967 BBC television series, where it did not yet include the third 'we can still rise now' verse. The words refer to the victory of the Scots, led by Robert I, over Edward II of England at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Although there is no official national anthem of Scotland, "Flower of Scotland" is one of a number of songs which are used, along with the older "Scotland the Brave". The lyrics and nature of "Flower of Scotland" split opinion amongst the Scottish public, given its reference to Scottish victory over the English at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 under the direction of Robert the Bruce. Billy Steele, who played as a winger in the Scottish national rugby union team began to encourage others players in the team to sing "Flower of Scotland" during the British Lions tour of South Africa in 1974. "Flower of Scotland" began being used as the pre-game anthem for the Scottish national rugby union team during the 1990 Five Nations Championship. By 1997, the Scottish Football Association had also made "Flower of Scotland" the official pre-game national anthem for the Scotland national football team. "Flower of Scotland" had been used informally by the Scottish Football Association for that purpose since 1993. The song was composed and is sung in English, with one Scots word ("Tae" for "To"). It has been translated into Scots. The song has been used as an anthem by the Scotland rugby union team, ever since the winger, Billy Steele, encouraged his team-mates to sing it on the British Lions tour of South Africa in 1974. The song was adopted as the pre-game anthem for the 1990 Five Nations Championship, first non-officially for the initial home game against France, then for the deciding match between Scotland and England at Murrayfield, which Scotland won 13–7 to win the Grand Slam. The Scottish Football Association adopted "Flower of Scotland" as its pre-game national anthem in 1997 although it was first used by them in 1993. Usually only the first and third verses are sung. The most common shouted interjections are "'Gainst who?" and "Bastards". The song was used as the victory anthem of Team Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in 2010, replacing "Scotland the Brave". This trend continued to the Commonwealth Games in 2014 where it was again Team Scotland's anthem and was sung following a Scottish gold medal. It was sung four times when Team Scotland won four gold medals in the opening day. At the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, the song was sung at Edinburgh Castle by 53 Scottish children selected from schools across Scotland. In July 2006, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted an online poll (publicised by Reporting Scotland) in which voters could choose a national anthem from one of five candidates. 10,000 people took part in the poll, in which "Flower of Scotland" came out the winner with 41% of the votes. On 13 January 2015, the Scottish Parliament heard evidence from a member of the public, Chris Cromar, who had brought forward a petition to the parliament for consideration on an agreed national anthem for Scotland. Cromar had, through the petition, called for the Scottish Government to formally recognise and adopt "Flower of Scotland" as the Scottish national anthem. The Scottish Football Association (SFA) responded to a written request from the Scottish Parliament regarding the petition, whereby they stated that they believed the matter of agreeing a national anthem for Scotland would be "more appropriate for the 35,000 members of the Scotland Supporter's Club members". The SFA conducted a poll amongst its members and audiences on its social media platforms, with "Flower of Scotland" achieving a narrow victory. Despite this, the SFA alluded to the matter that the narrowing victory suggested "some food for thought" over what the national anthem should be, with "Scotland the Brave" retaining an affinity amongst Scotland's football supporters. On 17 March 2015, the Scottish Parliament officially closed the consideration of the petition under Rule 15.7, claiming that "this is not something that should be led by the Scottish Government but is likely to be determined informally over time". MSP Angus MacDonald said in a speech to the Scottish Parliament about the petition that "given the position of the Scottish Government, and given that there is still a considerable amount of debate outside as to what the national anthem should be, we should close the petition reluctantly and allow that debate to continue". Paris Saint-Germain fans sing the chant "Ô Ville Lumière" ("City of Light") to the tune of Flower of Scotland. The song was featured on the 1983 album 'A Sense of Freedom' by the Wolfe Tones. David Tennant’s character Crowley sings the song in episode 3 of the second season of Good Omens.
