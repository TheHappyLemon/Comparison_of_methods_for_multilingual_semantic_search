Jääger made his senior league debut in the Esiliiga on 2 April 2000, playing for Flora affiliated Lelle in a 1–3 home loss to Merkuur Tartu. In December 2000, he moved to Flora's reserve side Valga. Jääger made his Flora – and Meistriliiga – debut on 4 November 2001, in a 3–0 away victory over Lootus. He won the Meistriliiga title in the 2003 season. On 3 February 2005, Jääger signed a three-year contract with Russian Premier League club Torpedo Moscow for an undisclosed fee, becoming third Estonian player in the club after Andres Oper and Andrei Stepanov. He made his debut in Russian Premier League on 13 March, in a 3–1 home win over Rostov. On 8 March 2007, Jääger signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Norwegian club Aalesund for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut in the Tippeligaen on 16 May 2007, in a 4–0 away victory over Strømsgodset. On 19 July 2009, Jääger signed for Serie B club Ascoli on a three-year deal. He made his debut in the Serie B on 21 August 2009, in 1–1 home draw against Gallipoli. Jääger failed to become a regular starter for Ascoli and was released by the club on 31 January 2010, after making just five league appearances. After rejecting an offer from Major League Soccer club New York Red Bulls, Jääger returned to Norway, where he signed a two-year contract with Aalesund on 5 March 2010. On 6 November 2011, Jääger assisted the opening goal in Aalesund's 2–1 victory over Brann in the Norwegian Cup final, winning his first trophy with the club. He didn't extend his contract after the 2011 season. On 5 January 2012, Jääger passed a medical examination at Ekstraklasa club Lechia Gdańsk, but rejected the contract offer to pursue other options. He then had a trial with the Scottish Premier League champions Rangers. Rangers manager Ally McCoist was impressed with Jääger and was keen on signing him, but the player had to leave the club without an offer as Rangers failed to reduce their wage bill in order to make room for new players. Despite interest from Championship sides Crystal Palace and Leeds United, and League One side Charlton Athletic, Jääger failed to secure a contract by March 2012. On 13 March 2012, Jääger signed a one-year contract with Aalesund, after receiving an improved offer from his former club. On 15 July 2013, Jääger signed a one-year contract with Belgian Pro League club Lierse, with an option to extend it for another year. He made his debut for the club on 27 July, in a 1–2 home loss to Zulte Waregem. In December 2014, Jääger joined the Flora first-team squad for training sessions. On 5 March 2015, he signed a one-year contract with the club. Jääger was named club captain ahead of the 2015 season. On 18 August 2015, Jääger signed for Tippeligaen club Vålerenga for the remainder of the 2015 season. He made his Vålerenga debut on 28 August, in 0–2 away loss to his former club Aalesund. On 4 January 2016, Jääger extended his contract for a year. On 30 March 2017, he extended his contract for another year. On 14 June 2019, Jääger once again returned to Flora, signing a contract for the rest of the season. Jääger was part of Flora's championship-winning 2019 Meistriliiga season, repeating as champions of the COVID-19 pandemic shortened 2020 Meistriliiga season. Jääger announced his retirement on 5 December 2020, following the club's final game of the season. Jääger began his youth career in 2000 with the Estonia under-16 team. He also represented the under-19, under-20, and under-21 national sides. Jääger made his senior international debut for Estonia on 12 October 2002, when he came on as a 69th-minute substitute for Marko Kristal in a 3–2 home victory over New Zealand in a friendly.
