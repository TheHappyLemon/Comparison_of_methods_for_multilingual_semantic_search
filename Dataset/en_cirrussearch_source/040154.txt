After representing both Norway and Kosovo at youth level, he made his senior international debut for the Kosovo national team in 2014. Celina grew up in Drammen, Norway, where he moved to as a refugee, with his family, at the age of two after leaving his native Kosovo to escape the ongoing war in the country. He started his youth career at Strømsgodset in Norway. In 2012, he was offered a scholarship from the Manchester City Reserves and Academy in England, where he spent the next two years as a scholar. On 1 July 2014, Celina signed a three-year professional contract with Manchester City. At the time, Celina was injured and had a surgery; after returning from injury, he remained with the youth team whilst rehabilitating. In late December 2014, Celina was called up to the first team by head coach Manuel Pellegrini due to the busy Christmas schedule that saw Manchester City play four games in just over a week. Celina was not selected in the 18-man squad for the three matches in the Premier League, but in the fourth match valid for the third round of FA Cup against Sheffield Wednesday on 4 January 2015, he made the matchday squad. Celina remained on the bench for the entire match, which finished with a 2–1 comeback victory for City. On 19 January 2015, Celina was selected to take part in the first-team squad's mid-season Abu Dhabi training camp along with three other Manchester City academy players. He was included along with Brandon Barker, George Evans and Thierry Ambrose from Patrick Vieira's Elite Development Squad for the trip to the Middle East. Celina made his first senior appearance for City as a substitute for Edin Džeko in a friendly against German side Hamburger SV. Celina made his official debut for the first team on 9 January 2016 in the FA Cup tie against Norwich City, coming on as an 85th-minute substitute in a 3–0 away win.

On 6 April, Celina scored his 5th goal for Twente in stoppage time, to save a 2–2 draw with PSV. He scored 5 goals in 28 appearances for Twente over the course of the season. Following the 2016–17 campaign Celina signed a new three-year deal with Manchester City. On 3 July 2017, Celina joined EFL Championship side Ipswich Town, on a season-long loan. He made his debut for Ipswich on 8 August in a 2–0 EFL Cup first-round win against Luton Town. On 22 August 2017, he scored his first goal for Ipswich in an EFL Cup second-round tie against Crystal Palace.

He made 40 appearances for Ipswich during the 2017–18 season, scoring 8 goals, with his long-range effort against Leeds United earning him the club's Goal of the Season award. On 31 July 2018, Celina signed for EFL Championship side Swansea City for a reported fee of £3 million with a further £1 million to follow in performance-based bonuses. One day later, the club confirmed that Celina had joined on a permanent transfer after agreeing to a four-year deal. On 4 August, he made his debut in a 2–1 away win against Sheffield United after being named in the starting line-up. He scored his first goal for the Swans in a 2–3 loss against his former club Ipswich Town on 6 October. On 13 March 2019, Celina was mocked in a 0–3 loss at West Bromwich Albion for slipping over while taking a penalty. Three days later, he scored in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup to give Swansea a 2–0 half time lead over his former club Manchester City at the Liberty Stadium, though they eventually lost the match 2–3. He made 42 appearances for Swansea during his first season at the club, scoring 8 goals. His FA Cup quarter-final strike against Manchester City won him the club's Goal of the Season award for the 2018–19 season.

He made his debut for the club 4 days later, coming on as a substitute in a 0–2 loss to Stade Brest. Celina went on to make 33 appearances in all competitions that season, providing 5 assists without scoring, with Dijon being relegated to Ligue 2 after finishing 20th. On 31 August 2021, Celina returned to Ipswich Town on a season-long loan. Ipswich had attempted to do a deal earlier in the summer, however the move was put on hold due to a heart condition Celina suffered from after contracting COVID-19. After Celina was cleared to return to training, Ipswich were able to complete the deal. He received the squad number 43. Eighteen days after signing for the club, he made his debut in a 1–0 away win against Lincoln City after being named in the starting line-up.

As soon as FIFA permitted Kosovo to play sanctioned friendly matches with other FIFA members in March 2014, Celina was called up to the Kosovo squad for their first sanctioned match against Haiti. He was an unused substitute for the match, which finished in a goalless draw. Celina missed the two upcoming friendlies against Turkey and Senegal in May due to injury, but returned in September 2014 for a match against Oman. He made his senior debut for Kosovo in that match, playing 83 minutes, as Kosovo won 1–0 to record the country's maiden win in senior men's football. In January 2015, Celina declared that he would turn down a call-up to represent Norway, as he wanted to play for Kosovo. Albert Bunjaki, the head coach of Kosovo declared that he would not be selected to play for Albania despite his holding dual citizenship from Norway and Kosovo. Celina scored his first goal for Kosovo on 13 November 2015 in a friendly match against Albania at the Pristina City Stadium. After making appearances with Kosovo's national side he also appeared once for Norway U21, keeping his options open. However, he all but confirmed his allegiance to Kosovo when he appeared in their first friendly as a FIFA nation, against the Faroe Islands on 3 June 2016. He made his competitive debut for Kosovo against Finland on 5 September 2016 in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier, coming on as a sub in the 66th minute, with the cap tying him to Kosovo, confirming which national team he would represent.
