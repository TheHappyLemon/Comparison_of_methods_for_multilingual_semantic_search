He appeared in the Academy Award-nominated film Music of the Heart (1999), played the title role in the film Igby Goes Down (2002), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and played the lead role in The Mighty (1998) as Kevin Dillon. From 2018 to 2023, he was one of the ensemble main cast members in the HBO series Succession, portraying immature and entitled COO Roman Roy. In 2018, 2020, and 2021, he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for performance on the show.

The comedy-drama revolves around a two cousins reuniting after their grandmother's death and end up going on a Holocaust tour in Poland.
