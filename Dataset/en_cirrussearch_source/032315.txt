Bwindi Rwenzori Kasubi Tombs The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Uganda accepted the convention on November 20, 1987, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. Uganda has three World Heritage Sites and a further five sites on its tentative list. The first two sites were listed in 1994, both for their natural significance. The most recent site, the Tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi, was listed in 2001 due to cultural significance. Rwenzori Mountains National Park was listed as endangered from 1999 to 2004 because of security issues and lack of monitoring by the park staff. The Kasubi Tombs were listed as endangered in 2010 because of a fire that destroyed several buildings and removed from the endangered list in 2023 following a careful reconstruction. UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural. In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Uganda maintains five properties on its tentative list.
