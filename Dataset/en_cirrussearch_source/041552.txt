The 1994 Winter Olympics, officially known by the International Olympic Committee as the XVII Olympic Winter Games, were a multi-sport event held in Lillehammer, Norway, from February 12 through February 27, 1994. A total of 1738 athletes representing 67 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated at the Games in 61 events across 12 disciplines. Derrick Campbell of Canada was obstructed by the Briton Nicky Gooch, who was disqualified. Campbell got up and thought he finished the race, and was celebrating his bronze medal with a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reporter live on television when he discovered he hadn't completed the race. He had miscounted and left the track one lap short of the finish line, and was classified as a non-finisher. This meant that Marc Gagnon was a surprise bronze medalist, even though he wasn't even in the A final. Athletes that won at least two gold medals or at least three total medals are listed below. 1994 Winter Olympics medal table Bjørnsen 1994 p. 302 "Lillehammer 1994". International Olympic Committee.
