The year 2024 is expected to exceed 2023's 223 orbital launches. So far, the year saw the successful first launch of Vulcan Centaur, Gravity-1, and notably the third developmental launch of SpaceX's Starship – IFT-3. Following the 2020s' trend, it is expected to that many more privately-developed launch vehicles will feature a maiden launch in 2024. In terms of other national-level scientific space missions, NASA's Europa Clipper probe, NASA's EscaPADE probe, ESA's Hera probe, and NISAR Earth observation satellite are planned to launch in 2024. NASA's Ingenuity helicopter ended operation in January due to damages to rotor blades after its 72nd flight. This year is also expected to see many lunar landing attempts. JAXA's SLIM and Intuitive Machines' IM-1 have successfully survived soft-landed on the Moon but were tipped over during final moments of descent. CNSA's Chang'e 6 is expected to land on the Moon in May. Two crewed space stations, the International Space Station (ISS) and Tiangong, are in operation in 2024. In terms of crewed missions, the ISS will be visited by Expedition 70, 71, and 72, while Shenzhou 17 and 18 will visit Tiangong. The ISS will also host private crews of Axiom Mission 3 and Axiom Mission 4. The ISS is also expected to see docking of Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser Demo-1. This year saw Alper Gezeravcı becoming the first Turkish astronaut, as a crew of Axiom Mission 3. Belarus also had its first citizen reach space, when cosmonaut Marina Vasilevskaya launched on Soyuz MS-25. On New Year's Day at 3:40 UTC marking the first launch of the new year, ISRO launched their XPoSat for studying X-ray polarization. It will serve as a complement to the present IXPE probe of NASA. Later the ISRO's Aditya-L1 spacecraft launched 5 months previously was inserted into a halo orbit around the Earth-Sun L1 point on January 6. It will study the solar atmosphere, solar magnetic storms, and their impact on the environment around Earth. Einstein Probe, X-ray space telescope mission by Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in partnership with ESA and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) dedicated to time-domain high-energy astrophysics, was launched on 9 January 2024. European Space Agency will launch their PROBA-3 dual satellites for solar coronagraphy. NASA’s Mars helicopter Ingenuity flew its 72nd and last flight on Jan. 18, 2024. Because all four of its rotor blades were damaged, NASA announced the end of mission for Ingenuity on Jan. 25, 2024. NASA plans to launch the Europa Clipper in October, which will study the Jovian moon Europa while in orbit around Jupiter. Hera will launch to Didymos asteroid to study the after effects of Double Asteroid Redirection Test. NASA's EscaPADE mission to Mars is also planned to launch this year. Peregrine lunar lander was successfully launched on 8 January, but after the launch a propellant leak was detected that precluded any attempt to perform a lunar landing. In the end, the Peregrine spacecraft never left the (highly elliptical) Earth orbit it was injected into by the carrier rocket, and the mission ended ten days later (after one orbit) on 18 January when the spacecraft re-entered the Earth's atmosphere (under control of the mission team) and was destroyed. SLIM achieved the first-ever lunar soft landing for a Japanese spacecraft. It landed on 19 January 2024 at 15:20 UTC, making Japan the 5th country to soft land on the Moon. Although it landed successfully, its in wrong attitude, because the solar panels are oriented westwards facing opposite the Sun at the start of lunar day, thereby failing to generate enough power. The lander operated on an internal battery power, which was fully drained that day. The mission's operators hope that the lander will wake up after a few days when sunlight should hit the solar panels. SLIM showed perseverance and survived another lunar night waking up on 28 March 2024. Irrespective of this solar array issue on lander, the two LEV 1 and 2 rovers, deployed during hovering just before final landing are working as expected and LEV-1 communicating independently to the ground stations. LEV-1 conducted seven hops over 107 minutes on lunar surface. Images taken by LEV-2 show the wrong attitude landing with loss of an engine nozzle during descent and even possible sustained damage to lander's Earth bound antenna, that is not pointed towards Earth. Irrespective of wrong attitude and loss of communication with the lander, the mission is already fully successful after confirmation of its primary goal landing within 100 m (330 ft) of its landing spot was already achieved. On 29 January, the lander resumed operations after being shut for a week. JAXA said it re-established contact with the lander and its solar cells were working again after a shift in lighting conditions allowed it to catch sunlight. After that, SLIM was put in sleep mode for impending harsh lunar night. SLIM was expected to operate only for one lunar daylight period, or 14 Earth days, and the on-board electronics were not designed to withstand the −120 °C (−184 °F) nighttime temperatures on the Moon. On 25 February 2024, JAXA sent wake-up calls and found SLIM had successfully survived the night on the lunar surface while maintaining communication capabilities. Since it was midday of the lunar day on the moon on 25 February 2024, the temperature of the communications payload was extremely high, so communication was terminated after only a short period of time. JAXA is now preparing for resumed operations, once the temperature has fallen sufficiently. This feat of surviving lunar night without a radioisotope heater unit was only previously achieved by some landers in the Surveyor program. IM-1 Nova-C Odysseus launched on 15 February 2024 towards the Moon via Falcon 9 on a direct intercept trajectory and later landed in the south polar region of the Moon on 22 February 2024 and became the first successful private lander and the first to do so using cryogenic propellants. Though it landed successfully, one of the lander's legs broke upon landing and it tilted up on other side, 18° due to landing on a slope, but the lander survived and payloads are functioning as expected. EagleCam was not ejected prior to landing. Just before landing, at approximately 30 m (98 ft) above the lunar surface, the Odysseus lander was planned to eject the EagleCam camera-equipped CubeSat, which would have been dropped onto the lunar surface near the lander, with an impact velocity of about 10 m/s (22 mph). However, due to complications arising from the software patch, it was decided that EagleCam would not be ejected upon landing. It was later ejected on 28 February but was partially failure as it returned all types of data, except post IM-1 landing images that were the main aim of its mission. On 13 March, China attempted to launch two spacecrafts, DRO-A and DRO-B, into distant retrograde orbit around the Moon, but the mission failed to reach the strived for orbit, remaining stranded in low Earth orbit. On 20 March 2024 China launched its relay satellite, Queqiao-2, in the orbit of the Moon, along with two mini satellites Tiandu 1 and 2. Queqiao-2 will relay communications for the Chang'e 6 (far side of the Moon), Chang'e 7 and Chang'e 8 (Lunar south pole region) spacecrafts. Tiandu 1 and 2 will test technologies for a future lunar navigation and positioning constellation. All the three probes entered lunar orbit successfully on 24 March 2024 (Tiandu-2 was attached to Tiandu-1 and separated in lunar orbit). China plans to send Chang'e 6 in May, which will conduct the first lunar sample return from the far side of the Moon. This will be China's second lunar sample return mission, the first was achieved by Chang'e 5 from the lunar near side 4 years ago. Pakistan will send a lunar orbiter called ICECUBE-Q along with Chang'e 6. Nova-C 2 and 3, VIPER and Blue Ghost are all planned to launch to the Moon this year. On 4 February, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko broke the world record for the most time spent in space, when he surpassed the previous record of 878 days, 11 hours, 29 minutes and 48 seconds held by retired cosmonaut Gennady Padalka. Kononenko is expected to return in late September, at which point he will have spent a total of 1110 days in space. ISRO will launch their Gaganyaan uncrewed missions and SPADEX docking experiment this year. Polaris Dawn, featuring the first commercial spacewalk, is planned to launch this year. SpaceX launched Axiom Mission 3 aboard a Crew Dragon spacecraft on a Falcon 9 rocket to the International Space Station (ISS) on 18 January 2024. The successful mission ended with a splashdown on 9 February 2024. SpaceX plans to launch Axiom Mission 4 to the ISS later in the year 2024. On 26 January Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity was successfully launched from Spaceport America on Galactic 06 suborbital space tourism mission. The maiden flight of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur took place on 8 January 2024. Vulcan is the first methane fueled rocket to reach orbit on its first attempt, and the first methane fueled rocket to reach orbit from the US. China's Orienspace's Gravity-1 rocket completed its successful maiden flight on January 11, 2024, debuting on a new mobile sea platform in the Yellow Sea while breaking records as both the world's largest solid-fuel carrier rocket and China's most powerful commercial launch vehicle to date (as of early 2024). On 5 March, for the first time due to their fast turnaround of 1 hour 51 minutes between launches, SpaceX launch operations for a mission (in this case, Starlink Group 6-41) coincided with that of a preceding launch (in this case, payload deployment of Transporter-10:(53 payloads SmallSat Rideshare). On 13 March, the KAIROS rocket from Space One company attempted its maiden flight. The rocket was destroyed in an explosion 5 seconds after lift-off. No injuries were caused by the explosion. Space Pioneer (aka Tianbing) of China plans to launch its Falcon 9 class kerolox rocket Tianlong-3 in June. The maiden flight of Blue Origin's New Glenn is planned for August 2024. NISAR, the most expensive and largest radar imaging satellite will be launched from India onboard GSLV Mk-II on 30 March 2024. Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem or PACE, a NASA Earth observing satellite, launched on 8 February 2024. NASA's Dream Chaser spaceplane, developed by Sierra Space, is scheduled to have its first flight in June. It will visit the International Space Station. For the purposes of this section, the yearly tally of orbital launches by country assigns each flight to the country of origin of the rocket, not to the launch services provider or the spaceport. For example, Electron rockets launched from the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand are counted under the United States because Electron is an American rocket. 10 20 30 40 Atlas Electron Falcon GSLV H-series Kuaizhou Long March LVM3 PSLV R-7 Vega Vulcan Others   Atlas V   Electron   Falcon 9 new   Falcon 9 reused   Falcon Heavy   GSLV   H-IIA   H3   Kuaizhou-1A   Long March 2   Long March 3   Long March 4   Long March 5   Long March 6   Long March 7   Long March 8   LVM3   PSLV   Soyuz-2   Soyuz-2-1v   Vega   Vulcan Centaur   Others 10 20 30 40 China France India Iran Japan Kazakhstan New Zealand Russia South Korea United Kingdom United States   Jiuquan   South China Sea   Taiyuan   Wenchang   Xichang   Yellow Sea   Kourou   Satish Dhawan   Semnan   Shahroud   Kii   Tanegashima   Uchinoura   Baikonur   Mahia   Plesetsk   Vostochny   Naro   SaxaVord   Cape Canaveral   Kennedy   MARS   PSCA   Starbase   Vandenberg 10 20 30 40 50 60 Transatmospheric Low Earth Medium Earth / Molniya Geosynchronous / Tundra / transfer High Earth / Lunar transfer Heliocentric   Transatmospheric   Low Earth   Low Earth (ISS)   Low Earth (CSS)   Low Earth (SSO)   Low Earth (polar)   Low Earth (retrograde)   Medium Earth   Molniya   Geosynchronous   Tundra   High Earth   Lunar transfer   Heliocentric For the purposes of this section, the yearly tally of suborbital launches by country assigns each flight to the country of origin of the rocket, not to the launch services provider or the spaceport.
