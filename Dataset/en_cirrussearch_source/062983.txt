The company reportedly pushed back against claims that it was promoting pro-Palestine, anti-Israel content through its feeds, stating instead that while the platform regularly moderates antisemitic, Anti-Arab racist, and Islamophobic content, it does not moderate nor amplify the spread of content expressing criticism of the Israeli government. He would later appear on Israeli sketch comedy show Eretz Nehederet to end 2023. "Celebrity Birthdays: Oct. 6". October 6, 2020. St. John, Warren (January 29, 2006). "Seinfeld It Ain't".
