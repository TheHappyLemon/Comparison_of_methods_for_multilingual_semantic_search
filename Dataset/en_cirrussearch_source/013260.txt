The UCI men's road racing world rankings are a point system which is used to rank men's road cycling riders. Points are accrued over a rolling 52 weeks in three categories (Individual, Nations and Teams). Also Year-End rankings exist, based on 12-month period in both Individual and Nations categories. All points available are determined on the importance level and for its prestige at each race. On 10 January 2016, a complete new 52-week rolling basis ranking system was introduced in road cycling, incorporating both World Tour and Continental Circuit races. Between 1948 and 2016 all rankings were Year-End, with no similarity to complete new 52 weeks system introduced in 2016: Year-end ranking included Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, Vuelta a España, Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Lombardia, Paris–Tours, Paris–Brussels and Tour de Suisse. Riders must have participated in at least one of the three races in each organizing country (Belgium, France and Italy) to appear in the top season rider final classification. It was the Challenge Desgrange-Colombo successor ranking. It rewarded the season best rider who had been the most consistent in the biggest races (points were awarded over the entire cycling season). Ranking was divided into three categories: Super Prestige Pernod (the best rider of the year), Prestige Pernod (the best French rider) and Pernod Promotion (the best French under 25). Ranking was designating the best cyclist of the season. It was organized by Professional Cycling Federation (FICP) from the 1984 to 1992 and by Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) from 1993 to 2004. UCI Road World Cup system that operated from 1989-2004, was successor of Super Prestige Pernod. It consisted of ten one-day events, designating the best rider of the season. UCI ProTour ranking (and the second-tier UCI Continental Circuits) was successor of UCI Road World Cup. It was a series of road bicycle races in Europe, Australia and Canada designating the best rider of the season. The ProTour rankings were replaced with a World Ranking system for 2009-2010, though this only considered a small number of ProTour and other high-prestige races, and was then merged into the World Tour in 2011. UCI World Tour ranking merged with ex UCI ProTour ranking in 2011. It was designating the best rider and the best team of the season between 2009 and 2018; and the best nation of the season between 2009 and 2016. last update: 26 March 2024 last update: 26 March 2024 The following is a list of Top 3 riders, teams and nations at the end of each season: Source: "Rankings".
