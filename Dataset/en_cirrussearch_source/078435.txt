Adam is the name given in Genesis 1-5 to the first human. Adam is the first human-being aware of God, and features as such in various belief systems (including Judaism, Gnosticism, Christianity, and Islam). According to Christianity, Adam sinned in the Garden of Eden by eating from the Tree of Knowledge. This action introduced death and sin into the world. This sinful nature infected all his descendants, and led humanity to be expelled from the Garden. Only through the Crucifixion of Jesus, humanity can be redeemed. In Islam, Adam is considered Khalifa (خليفة) (successor) on earth. This is understood to mean either that he is God's deputy, the initiation of a new cycle of sentient life on earth, or both. Similar to the account in the Bible, according to the Quran, Adam is placed in a Garden. Tempted by the Tree of Immortality, he sins and loses his abode in the Garden. When Adam repents from his sin, he is forgiven by God. This is seen as a guidance for human-life, who sin, become aware of their mistake, and repent. In Gnostic belief-systems, the bodily creation of Adam is viewed in a negative light. Due to the underlying demonization of matter, Gnostic cosmologies depict the body as a form of prison of Adam's soul. This soul would have been transferred by Sophia (wisdom) onto the creator (Demiurge) of the material world, who in turn is tricked into blowing the soul into a body. From this body, Adam rises up and becomes a sentient being. However, to escape from the world of matter, he needs to attain Gnosis. In Genesis 1-5 the name is given to the first human. Beyond its use as the name of the first man, adam is also used in the Bible as a pronoun, individually as "a human" and in a collective sense as "mankind". Genesis 1 tells of God's creation of the world and its creatures, including adam, meaning humankind; in Genesis 2 God forms "Adam", this time meaning a single male human, out of "the dust of the ground", places him in the Garden of Eden, and forms a woman, Eve, as his companion; in Genesis 3 Adam and Eve eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge and God condemns Adam to labour on the earth for his food and to return to it on his death; Genesis 4 deals with the birth of Adam's sons, and Genesis 5 lists his descendants from Seth to Noah. In the entire Hebrew Bible, Adam appears only in chapters 1–5 of the Book of Genesis, with the exception of a mention at the beginning of the Books of Chronicles where, as in Genesis, he heads the list of Israel's ancestors. The majority view among scholars is that the final text of Genesis dates from the Persian period (the 5th century BCE), but the absence of all the other characters and incidents mentioned in chapters 1–11 of Genesis from the rest of the Hebrew Bible has led a sizeable minority to the conclusion that these chapters were composed much later than those that follow, possibly in the 3rd century BCE. The Bible uses the word אָדָם‎ ( 'adam ) in all of its senses: collectively ("mankind", Genesis 1:27), individually (a "man", Genesis 2:7), gender nonspecific ("man and woman", Genesis 5:1–2), and male (Genesis 2:23–24). In Genesis 1:27 "adam" is used in the collective sense, and the interplay between the individual "Adam" and the collective "humankind" is a main literary component to the events that occur in the Garden of Eden, the ambiguous meanings embedded throughout the moral, sexual, and spiritual terms of the narrative reflecting the complexity of the human condition. Genesis 2:7 is the first verse where "Adam" takes on the sense of an individual man (the first man), and the context of sex is absent; the gender distinction of "adam" is then reiterated in Genesis 5:1–2 by defining "male and female". A recurring literary motif is the bond between Adam and the earth (adamah): God creates Adam by molding him out of clay in the final stages of the creation narrative. After the loss of innocence, God curses Adam and the earth as punishment for his disobedience. Adam and humanity are cursed to die and return to the earth (or ground) from which he was formed. This "earthly" aspect is a component of Adam's identity, and Adam's curse of estrangement from the earth seems to describe humankind's divided nature of being earthly yet separated from nature. Genesis 1 tells of God's creation of the world and its creatures, with humankind as the last of his creatures: "Male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam ..." (Genesis 5:2). God blesses mankind, commands them to "be fruitful and multiply", and gives them "dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth" (Genesis 1.26–27). In Genesis 2, God forms "Adam", this time meaning a single male human, out of "the dust of the ground" and "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life" (Genesis 2:7). God then places this first man in the Garden of Eden, telling him that "Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Genesis 2:16–17). God notes that "It is not good that the man should be alone" (Genesis 2:18) and brings the animals to Adam, who gives them their names, but among all the animals there was not found a companion for him (Genesis 2:20). God causes a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and forms a woman (Genesis 2:21–22), and Adam awakes and greets her as his helpmate. Genesis 3, the account of the Fall: A serpent persuades the woman to disobey God's command and eat of the tree of knowledge, which gives wisdom. Woman convinces Adam to do likewise, whereupon they become conscious of their nakedness, cover themselves, and hide from the sight of God. God questions Adam, who blames the woman. God passes judgment, first upon the serpent, condemned to go on his belly, then the woman, condemned to pain in childbirth and subordination to her husband, and finally Adam, who is condemned to labour on the earth for his food and to return to it on his death. God then expels the man and woman from the garden, lest they eat of the Tree of Life and become immortal. The chiastic structure of the death oracle given to Adam in Genesis 3:19 forms a link between man's creation from "dust" (Genesis 2:7) to the "return" of his beginnings. A you return B to the ground C since (kî ) from it you were taken C' for (kî ) dust you are B' and to dust A' you will return Genesis 4 deals with the birth of Adam's sons Cain and Abel and the story of the first murder, followed by the birth of a third son, Seth. Genesis 5, the Book of the Generations of Adam, lists the descendants of Adam from Seth to Noah with their ages at the birth of their first sons (except Adam himself, for whom his age at the birth of Seth, his third son, is given) and their ages at death (Adam lives 930 years, up to the 56th year of Lamech, father of Noah). The chapter notes that Adam had other sons and daughters after Seth, but does not name them. Louis Ginzberg retells a midrash that God himself took dust from all four corners of the earth, and with each color (red for the blood, black for the bowels, white for the bones and veins, and green for the pale skin), created Adam. The soul of Adam is the image of God, and as God fills the world, so the soul fills the human body: "as God sees all things, and is seen by none, so the soul sees, but cannot be seen; as God guides the world, so the soul guides the body; as God in His holiness is pure, so is the soul; and as God dwells in secret, so doth the soul." According to Jewish literature, Adam possessed a body of light, identical to the light created by God on the first day, and the original glory of Adam can be regained through mystical contemplation of God. The rabbis, puzzled by fact that Genesis 1 states that God created man and woman together while Genesis 2 describes them being created separately, told that when God created Adam he also created a woman from the dust, as he had created Adam, and named her Lilith; but the two could not agree, for Adam wanted Lilith to lie under him, and Lilith insisted that Adam should lie under her, and so she fled from him, and Eve was created from Adam's rib. Her story was greatly developed, during the Middle Ages, in the tradition of Aggadic midrashim, the Zohar and Jewish mysticism. Other rabbis explained the same verse as meaning that Adam was created with two faces, male and female, or as a single hermaphrodite being, male and female joined back to back, but God saw that this made walking and conversing difficult, and so split them apart. The serpent approached Eve rather than Adam because Adam had heard the word of God with his own ears, whereas Eve had only his report; Eve tasted the fruit and knew at once that she was doomed to death, and said to herself that it was better she trick Adam into eating so that he too would die, and not take another woman in her place. Adam ate the fruit unaware of what he was doing, and was filled with grief. When Adam blamed Eve after eating the forbidden fruit, God rebuked him that Adam as a man should not have obeyed his wife, for he is the head, not her. An Aggadic legend found in tractate Avodah Zarah 8a contains observations regarding the Roman mid-winter holidays and, the talmudic hypothesis that Adam the first established the tradition of fasting before the winter solstice, and rejoicing afterward, which festival later devolved into the Roman Saturnalia and Calenda. Adam withdrew from Eve for 130 years after their expulsion from Eden, and in this time both he and Eve had sex with demons, until at length they reunited and Eve gave birth to Seth. A 2nd-century BCE Jewish religious work, the Book of Jubilees, tells how Adam had a daughter, Awân, born after Cain and Abel, and another daughter, Azura, born after Seth, and they had nine other sons; Cain married Awân and Seth married Azûrâ, thus accounting for their descendants. The Life of Adam and Eve and its Greek version the Apocalypse of Moses recount how Adam repented his sin in exile and was rewarded by being transported to the heavenly paradise, foreshadowing the destiny of all the righteous at the end of time. The Archangel Michael attended Adam's death, together with Eve and his son Seth, still living at that time, and he was buried together with his murdered son Abel. Because they repented, God gave Adam and Eve garments of light, and similar garments will clothe the Messiah when he comes. According to the Apocalypse of Moses, which probably originates in first-century CE Jewish literature, the altar of the Temple of Solomon was the centre of the world and the gateway to God's Garden of Eden, and it was here that Adam was both created and buried. In the 17th-century book Kav ha-Yashar, the author warns not to talk negatively about Adam, and writes that those who talk positively about Adam will be blessed with a long life. A similar warning can be found in The Zohar. The Sefer Raziel HaMalakh (רזיאל המלאך) (Raziel the Angel) is a collection of esoteric writings, probably compiled and edited by the same hand, but originally not the work of one author, which according to tradition was revealed to Adam by the angel Raziel. The book cannot be shown to predate the 13th century, but may in parts date back to Late Antiquity, and like other obscure ancient texts such as the Bahir and Sefer Yetzirah, it has been extant in a number of versions. Zunz ("G. V." 2d ed., p. 176) distinguishes three main parts: (1) the Book Ha-Malbush; (2) the Great Raziel; (3) the Book of Secrets, or the Book of Noah. These three parts are still distinguishable—2b–7a, 7b–33b, 34a and b. After these follow two shorter parts entitled "Creation" and "Shi'ur Ḳomah", and after 41a come formulas for amulets and incantations. The idea of original sin is not found in Judaism nor in Islam, and was introduced into Christianity by the Apostle Paul, drawing on currents in Hellenistic Jewish thought which held that Adam's sin had introduced death and sin into the world. Sin, for Paul, was a power to which all humans are subject, but Christ's coming held out the means by which the righteous would be restored to the Paradise from which Adam's sin had banished mankind. He did not conceive of this original sin of Adam as being biologically transmitted or that later generations were to be punished for the deeds of a remote ancestor. It was Augustine who took this step, locating sin itself in male semen: when Adam and Eve ate of the fruit they were ashamed and covered their genitals, identifying the place from which the first sin was passed on to all succeeding generations. Only Jesus Christ, who was not conceived by human semen, was free of the stain passed down from Adam. (Augustine's idea was based on the ancient world's ideas on biology, according to which male sperm contained the entire unborn baby, the mother's womb being no more than a nurturing chamber in which it grew.) As mentioned above, the Apocalypse of Moses, a Jewish writing containing material probably originating from the first century CE, places both Adam's place of creation and his burial at the altar of the Temple of Solomon, seen as the centre of the world and the gateway to the Garden of Eden. The early Christian community adapted this to their own legend of Golgotha, replacing the altar with the place of Jesus's crucifixion. According to this Christian legend, current in the time of Origen (early 3rd century CE), the holy blood of Christ trickled down and restored to life the father of the human race, who then led the saints who appeared to many in Jerusalem on that day as described in Scripture. In Mandaeism, Adam is considered the founder of the religion and the first prophet. He heralds manda (knowledge) and the true path of enlightenment. He is viewed as the propagator of kushta or divine truth.: 31, 45  According to the Mandaean calendar, 2021–2022 CE in the Gregorian calendar would correspond to the Mandaean year 445391 AA (AA = after the creation of Adam). In the ancient Gnostic text On the Origin of the World, Adam originally appears as a primordial being born from light poured out by the aeon known as forethought. Accordingly, his primordial form is called Adam of Light. But when he desired to reach the eighth heaven, he was unable to because of the corruption mixed with his light. Thus he creates his own realm, containing six universes and their worlds which are seven times better than the heavens of Chaos. All these realms exist within the region between the eighth heaven and the Chaos beneath it. But when the archons saw him, they realize the chief creator of the material world (Yaldabaoth) had lied to them by claiming he was the only god. However, they decide to create a physical version of Adam in the image of the spiritual Adam. But Sophia later sends her daughter Zoe (the spiritual Eve) to give the physical Adam life before leaving the physical Eve with Adam and entering the Tree of Knowledge. However, according to the Hypostasis of the Archons, a spirit descends on the physical Adam and gives him a living soul. In Islam Adam is the first man created by God. It is from him that all human beings are descended. Surah, Al-Baqara : When your Lord confided to the Angels : I will establish a vicar (khalifah) on the earth. They said : Will You appoint one there who will cause disorder and shed blood, while we are there sanctifying You and glorifying You ? » -He said : Verily, I know what you do not know! » (2:30). Creation The creation of Adam was made from clay. (God) Allah sent the angels throughout the world to collect earth. It was of various colors : red, white, brown, black. This is why all human beings have different skin colors, character traits, and appearances. God honored Adam by creating him with his own hand. Then He breathed into him his breath of life. And once the soul was breathing, He ordered the angels to prostrate themselves. God said : When your Lord said to the angels : I will create a human being from clay. Once I have given it its final form and animated it with My breath, you will prostrate yourself before it. Disobedience of ibliss Surah, Al-Baqara : And when We asked the Angels to prostrate themselves before Adam, they prostrated themselves with the exception of Iblîs who refused, became puffed up with pride and was among the infidels. (2:34) Surah, Al-A'raf: God says We have created you, We have shaped you. Then We said to the angels : Prostrate yourself before Adam! Everyone complied, only Satan refused to bow. (7:11). Surah Al-Hijr : Then God said  O Iblis! Why are you not among the prostrates ? (15:32) Surah, Al-Hijr He said : I am not such as to prostrate myself before a man whom You created from sounding clay, extracted from malleable mud. (15:32) Surah, Al-A'raf Allah says : What prevented you from prostrating yourself when I commanded you ? He replied : I am better than him : You created me from fire, while You created him from clay. (11:27) Surah, Sad : God says Then leave here, for you are banished! And the curse will be on you until the Day of Judgment! (38:77-37:78) Surah Al-A'raf : Lord, said Iblis, give me a period of time, until the day when they will be resurrected. (38:79) Surah, Sad : Allah says You are one of those to whom a delay is granted. (38:80) Surah Al-Hijr God said : Lord, said Satan, since You have led me astray, I will work to mislead men, by beautifying, in their eyes, life on Earth, except for the faithful whom You have chosen. » God says here is a rule which will be sovereign. You will have no control over My servants, except those who follow you among the misguided and who will all find themselves in Gehenna. (15:39-15:40) Adam and Eve So one morning, when he woke up, he saw a woman watching him. Adam opened his eyes and saw a beautiful woman watching him, leaning over him. Surprised, he asked the woman why she had been created. She told him that she was there to fill his loneliness and so that he could live peacefully with her. The angels questioned Adam, they knew that he possessed knowledge which they lacked and which was essential to the life of men on earth. They asked : Who is it ? » And Adam answered : It is Eve. Eve is called Hawwa, in Arabic, this name comes from the root word hay, which means to live. Eve is also a variation of the ancient Hebrew name Havva, which also has its origins in the root word hay. Adam told the angels that Eve was so named because he was created from a part of himself and that he himself was a living being. Surah, An-Nisa : And God said : O men! Fear your Lord, who created you from one being and who created his companion from it; then, from [the union of] these two, He caused a multitude of men and women to proliferate on all sides. (4:1) Adam and Eve lived peacefully in paradise. Judaism, Christianity and Islam all agree on this fact. Islam teaches us that Adam and Eve had all of Paradise to themselves and that God said to Adam : Surah Al-Baqara : O Adam! Dwell in Paradise, you and your spouse, and eat of all its fruits as you please... (2:35) Surah, Al-Baqara : God continues to address Adam and Eve, warning them: ...do not approach this tree, otherwise you would be among the unjust. (2:35) Satan was therefore in Paradise with Adam and Eve, and he had sworn to lead them astray and deceive them and their descendants. Surah, Al-A'raf He said: ...I will be on the lookout for them on Your straight path. Then I will attack them from the front, from the back, from the right and from the left. (7:16-17) Arrogant, Satan believed himself better than Adam and all humanity that would descend from him. Satan is very cunning and knows very well where men's weaknesses are hidden; he knows their desires and their passions. Satan never told Adam and Eve go eat from this tree, just as he did not openly tell them to disobey God. Rather, He whispered it into their hearts and sowed them with disturbing thoughts and desires. Surah, Al-A'raf : Then, the Devil, in order to make visible to them what was hidden from them - their nakedness - whispered to them, saying : Your Lord has only forbidden you this tree to prevent you from becoming Angels or 'be immortal! (7:20) Surah, Ta-ha : Adam and Eve thus ate of the fruits of the tree. And this is how their nakedness appeared to them, and they began to cover themselves with leaves of Paradise. This is how Adam disobeyed his Lord and went astray. Subsequently, his Lord welcomed him into His grace, forgave him and put him back on the right path. (20:121-122) Surah, Al-A'raf : Then he brought them down by deception. Then, when they had tasted of the tree, their nakedness became visible to them; and they both began to attach leaves of Paradise to it. And their Lord called to them : Have I not forbidden you this tree ? And did I not tell you that the Devil was a declared enemy for you ? (7:22). Surah, Al-A'raf Both said: O our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. And if You do not forgive us and show us mercy, we will most certainly be among the losers. (7:23). God says in the Quran : By deception, Satan brought about their downfall. (7:22) Surah, Ta-Ha God says : Get down from here! You will constantly be enemies of each other! And if guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows it will not go astray, nor will they be unhappy. (20:123) Surah, Al-Baqara : We then said : All of you come down from these places! And whenever I send you My guidance, those who follow them need not fear nor grieve. As for those who do not heed it and who treat Our signs as lies, they will be doomed to Hell, which will be their eternal home. (2:36-39). Surah, Al-A'raf : There will be for you, on earth, a stay and means of subsistence for a time. Then He said: There you will live, there you will die, and from there you will be taken out. (7:24-25). Adam and Eve therefore descend from Paradise and begin a new life on earth. God had paved the way for them in many ways. He had made known to them the whispers of Satan and they knew that they must now seek to guard against it. He had taught Adam the names of all things and taught him their characteristics and uses. Adam therefore undertook to play his role as viceroy and prophet of God on earth. God gave Adam, His first prophet, the responsibility of teaching his wife and children how to worship God and ask Him for forgiveness. Adam established God's laws on earth and strove to provide for his people by working the land. His task was to perpetuate the human race, to cultivate the land and build shelters for his people. He also had to raise children who would live according to God's laws and who would care for the earth. The Druze regard Adam as the first spokesman (natiq), who helped to transmit the foundational teachings of monotheism (tawhid) intended for a larger audience. He is also considered an important prophet of God in Druze faith, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history. Some Taoists in the Tang dynasty, inspired by Emperor Taizong's syncretic beliefs and policies encouraging it, viewed the Christian version of Jesus as a redemptive manifestation of "the Way", and respected his ancestors, including Adam, as well. Some Mongolian Christians and Muslims thought Adam was the same person as Gautama Buddha. While a traditional view was that the Book of Genesis was authored by Moses and has been considered historical and metaphorical, modern scholars consider the Genesis creation narrative as one of various ancient origin myths. Analysis like the documentary hypothesis also suggests that the text is a result of the compilation of multiple previous traditions, explaining apparent contradictions. Other stories of the same canonical book, like the Genesis flood narrative, are also understood as having been influenced by older literature, with parallels in the older Epic of Gilgamesh. In biology, the most recent common ancestors of humans, when traced back using the Y-chromosome for the male lineage and mitochondrial DNA for the female lineage, are commonly called the Y-chromosomal Adam and Mitochondrial Eve respectively as a reference to Adam and Eve. These do not fork from a single couple at the same epoch even if the names were borrowed from the Tanakh. Christianity portal Islam portal Judaism portal Adam's grave or burial site of his skull Cave of Machpelah in Hebron; according to traditional Jewish belief Temple of Solomon; according to the Jewish book, the Apocalypse of Moses Golgotha; now Adam's Chapel in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem; according to Christian tradition based on the Apocalypse of Moses Monastery of the Cross in Jerusalem; according to Christian tradition Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf; according to Shia tradition, after Noah buried him there following the deluge.
