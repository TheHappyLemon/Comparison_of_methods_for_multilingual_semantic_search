Dominic Thiem (German pronunciation: [ˈdɔmɪnɪk ˈtiːm]; born 3 September 1993) is an Austrian professional tennis player. He has been ranked as high as world No. 3 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals, which he first achieved in March 2020. Thiem has won 17 ATP Tour singles titles, including a Grand Slam title at the 2020 US Open where he came back from two sets down to defeat Alexander Zverev in the final. With the win, Thiem became the first male player born in the 1990s to claim a Major singles title, as well as the first Austrian to win the US Open singles title. He had previously reached three other Major finals, finishing runner-up at the 2018 and 2019 French Open to Rafael Nadal, and at the 2020 Australian Open to Novak Djokovic. Thiem was also runner-up at the 2019 and 2020 ATP Finals, where he lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas and Daniil Medvedev, respectively. As a junior, Thiem was ranked as high as world No. 2. He was runner-up at the 2011 French Open boys tournament, and won the 2011 Orange Bowl. As a professional, he broke into the top 100 for the first time in 2014. In 2015, he won his first ATP title at the 2015 Open de Nice Côte d'Azur in France. The next year he reached his first major semifinal at the 2016 French Open. In doing so, he first entered the top ten of the world rankings. He went on to reach his first Masters 1000 final in 2017 at the Madrid Open, before reaching his first major final the following year. Thiem won his maiden Masters 1000 title at the 2019 Indian Wells Masters, beating Roger Federer in the final. In 2021, Thiem suffered a wrist injury that has weakened his results, but has since slowly risen back up to the top 100. Thiem has some of the heaviest groundstrokes of the tour, consistently hitting big with both his forehand and single-handed backhand. Generally thought of as a baseliner, he has added more variety with the use of a sliced backhand and more netplay since adding coach Nicolás Massú to his team in March 2019. At 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in), he possesses a serve reaching up to 145 miles per hour (233 km/h), which he often uses to set up effective one-two punches. Thiem won the 2020 Austrian Sportsman of the Year award, the fourth time a tennis player has won the award since its creation in 1949. Thiem was born in Wiener Neustadt, Austria on 3 September 1993 to Wolfgang and Karin Thiem, both of whom are tennis coaches. He has a younger brother, Moritz Thiem, who is also a professional tennis player. Thiem grew up in Lichtenwörth and began playing tennis when he was six years old. Thiem's father, Wolfgang, began working as a coach at Günter Bresnik's academy in Vienna in 1997, when Thiem was just three years old. Bresnik became Thiem's coach formally from age nine. It was Bresnik who advised the change of Thiem's two-handed backhand to a one-handed backhand when he was 12 years old. Bresnik has said that Thiem's junior results took a dip for about a year while the stroke developed. Thiem struggled with health issues when he was 17 years old, which he attributed to a large growth spurt of 16 centimetres (6 in) he had that year. Thiem entered his first event on the International Tennis Federation (ITF) junior circuit in early 2008 when he was 14. Thiem reached an ITF Junior Circuit ranking of world No. 2 (combined singles and doubles) on 3 January 2011. He did not play many events in 2008, returning with a fuller schedule in 2009.

At the Bavarian International Tennis Championships, Thiem defeated Constant Lestienne and Marc-Andrea Hüsler to reach the second quarterfinal of the season, where he lost to Taylor Fritz in straight sets. In the Challenger tournament in Mauthausen, Thiem was the favourite to win the title and reached his third quarterfinal of the season. After defeating Dino Prizmic, he fell to the young Serbian Hamad Medjedovic in straight sets in the semifinals. In the next Challenger in Bordeaux where he entered as an alternate, he defeated Benoît Paire. Thiem began his grass season at the Halle Open, but fell to Alexander Zverev in straight sets.

In 2024, Thiem muscled through his qualifying matches in Brisbane, narrowly defeating James McCabe and Giulio Zeppieri in three sets. In the main draw, he was matched against Rafael Nadal, who was making his comeback after a year's hiatus from the sport due to injury. In their 16th meeting, Thiem was defeated in straight sets by Nadal. He continued the Australian season by playing at the exhibition tournament in Kooyong, losing to Andy Murray but winning his match against Francisco Cerundolo, both in straight sets. He ended his Australian campaign in Melbourne, losing a 5-set, near 5-hour match against Felix Auger-Aliassime. At the end of January, Thiem separated from his coach, Benjamin Ebrahimzadeh, and announced he would play in three Challenger tournaments instead of the Sunshine Double. In February, Thiem played for Austria at the World Group I play-offs in the Davis Cup, winning his singles match in straight sets against Michael Agwi. He then headed to Oslo for the UTS Tour, nicknamed 'Thieminho', appearing for the first time since 2020. He lost his matches against Alexander Bublik and Holger Rune, before withdrawing due to food poisoning. In March, he decided to skip the tournaments in the Sunshine double in the USA and compete at the ATP Challenger level instead. Thiem and Rafael Nadal have met 16 times; Thiem trails 6–10 (37%). The majority of their meetings have been on clay. They first met in 2014 at Roland Garros with Nadal coming out the victor. Their next meeting was in 2016, this time in Buenos Aires and Thiem prevailed for his first win against Nadal. Thiem went on to beat Nadal once a year on clay for the next three years until 2019, joining Djokovic as one of two players to have defeated Nadal on clay four times or more. Thiem and Nadal have twice met in the French Open final in 2018 and 2019, both going Nadal's way, straight sets in 2018 and four sets the following year. Nadal said “He [was] the most difficult opponent,” of the 2019 championship. Their hard court record is tied 2–2. Their first meeting on hard was one of their closest encounters, a four hour 49 minute quarterfinal at the 2018 US Open. Thiem won the first set to love, before Nadal fought back to claim victory in a fifth set tiebreak, despite winning six fewer points during the match. The next meeting at the 2020 Australian Open quarterfinals went the other way, featuring 3 tiebreaks, Thiem defeating Nadal on hard court for the first time. In their first meeting on indoor hard court at the 2020 ATP Finals, Thiem won in two tight sets. In 2024, after narrowly winning his qualifying matches, Thiem drew Nadal in the first round of the Brisbane International, which marked Nadal's return to the sport after an almost year-long hiatus as well as the pair's first competitive match in 3 years. Thiem lost the match in straight sets. Thiem and Novak Djokovic have met 12 times; Thiem trails 5–7 (42%). Djokovic won their first five meetings from 2014 to 2017 before Thiem won his first match against him in the 2017 French Open quarterfinals. They split the next two matches they played, both at clay Masters in Monte Carlo and Madrid in 2018 and 2019 respectively. They met again at the French Open in 2019, this time in the semifinals. Thiem defeated Djokovic in a five set match over two days lasting four hours 13 minutes in very windy and showery conditions. Thiem also won their 2019 ATP Finals round robin match in a third set tiebreak, Djokovic praising him afterwards for his "courageous tennis". Meeting in the final of the 2020 Australian Open, they had another five set match, this time Djokovic prevailing for his eighth Australian Open title. Coming from 0–4 down in the final set tiebreak, Thiem won their semifinal meeting at the 2020 ATP Finals. Thiem and Roger Federer met 7 times, with Thiem winning 5 matches (71%). The pair split their first four meetings, Federer winning on hard court in Brisbane in 2016, and at the 2018 ATP Finals, Thiem winning in 2016 on clay in Rome and on grass in Stuttgart. In 2019, the rivalry entered at two wins apiece and the pair played three times. First, in the Indian Wells championship match, Federer took the first set but Thiem came back to win in three sets for his first Masters 1000 title. Two months later, they played on clay at the Madrid Open, with Thiem winning again in three sets after losing the first, Thiem winning after saving two match points in the second set tiebreak. Their final match was contested at the 2019 ATP Finals round robin; Thiem again prevailed in two sets. Thiem and Alexander Zverev have met 12 times; Thiem leads 8–4 (66.67%). Thiem won their first three meetings, all in 2016 and on clay, including a first title fight in Nice before Zverev retaliated with a win on hard court in Beijing later in the year. In 2017, Thiem claimed their only meeting in Rotterdam. In 2018 they contested two matches, the first a Masters 1000 final at the Madrid Open, with Zverev taking his third Masters title in straight sets. The second was in the French Open quarterfinals, this time Thiem winning in straight sets. Thiem took their only encounter in 2019 at the Tour Finals, saving all four break point opportunities that Zverev created. In 2020 their rivalry took place on the biggest stages as they contested a Grand Slam semifinal at the Australian Open, and a final at the US Open. In Zverev's first semifinal and final appearances Thiem was the more experienced player and showed this in Melbourne, winning in four sets. In New York in September Zverev started the match confidently while Thiem was nervous, "I was so tight in the beginning," he said of the first two sets. However the dynamic changed, Thiem overcame his nerves to win the match in a fifth set tiebreak. At the 2021 Madrid Open, Zverev defeated Thiem in the semifinals in straight sets for the second time in Madrid. Their most recent encounter was at the 2023 Halle Open where Zverev defeated Thiem 6-3 6-4 in straight sets. Thiem is primarily an aggressive baseline player, who is adept at defending, as well. His groundstrokes are solid on both wings, with a heavy forehand and a tenacious, powerful single-handed backhand. He is one of the few ATP players to use a single-handed backhand. According to Thiem, he changed to his single-handed backhand at the advice of his coach. His backhand can effectively handle high bouncing balls, which has been a big problem for many conventional single-handers. Thiem often uses heavy, penetrating groundstrokes to construct points and outlast his opponents. He has a long take-back on both wings, and the top-spin he produces on his groundstrokes allows him to both attack and defend well. Thiem also possesses a strong serve, capable of reaching 145 mph (233 km/h). He often returns serve from as far back as possible, which allows him to take more time and prepare full swings at returns. Thiem has improved his slice backhand, an important shot especially on low bouncing hard courts. His deliberate, yet aggressive playing style, particularly the long take-back on his groundstrokes, ability to sustain long baseline rallies and top-spin serves have greatly benefited his clay game. The Roland Garros website described him as an "heir to the throne." He has beaten many high-ranked clay-court players on clay, recording four wins over Rafael Nadal on the surface. He defeated Nicolás Almagro and Nadal en route to his Argentina Open title, as well as Stan Wawrinka at the 2014 Madrid Open, Roger Federer at the 2016 Italian Open and the 2019 Madrid Open, and Novak Djokovic at the French Open both in 2017 and 2019. His mental game has also been praised, especially his tiebreak win percentage. Thiem has been represented by Herwig Straka since his split with former coach and manager Gunter Bresnik in May 2019. Thiem has been using Babolat rackets since 2014 and is the face of the Pure Strike line; he was involved in the testing and development of the 2019 version which he uses. Adidas is Thiem's apparel and footwear sponsor. Thiem is a Rolex Testimonee, and is sponsored by Kia, Sky Sport and Tecnogym. Thiem has endorsed Red Bull since 2018, wearing a patch for them and often drinking the energy drink on court. He also participated in their 2020 charity Wings for Life World Run. Thiem is a brand ambassador for Bank Austria, and he has appeared in several advertising campaigns for the Austrian bank. In August 2020, Thiem became a brand ambassador for Duravit, a bathroom manufacturer. In 2021 Thiem became a testimonee and partnered with Neoh, a low carbohydrate protein bar start up. Thiem began dating fellow tennis player Kristina Mladenovic in 2017. They publicly confirmed their relationship in May 2018 and split up in November 2019. Thiem has been dating circus performer, socialite and Let's Dance winner Lili Paul-Roncalli since October 2020. Thiem is a big fan of football and is a Chelsea supporter. He founded his own football club called 1.TFC Matzendorf in 2016, which consists of friends and fellow tennis players who come together a few times a year to play charity games. Thiem supports the environment, donating and raising awareness for 4ocean and the WWF. On ocean pollution he said "It's one of the biggest problems nowadays that we face, with all the plastic pollution. I love nature and I'm trying to support this whenever I can." Thiem was also part of his apparel sponsor Adidas' 2019 Parley tennis collection campaign, the clothing of the collection being made from recycled plastic waste collected from beaches and coastlines with the aim to raise awareness and help tackle marine pollution. In April 2021, Thiem appeared in a campaign for bee protection. The project, called Bio Bienen Apfel, aims to raise awareness about creating a habitat for bees in areas of Germany and Austria.
