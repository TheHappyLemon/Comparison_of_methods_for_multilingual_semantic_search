Zara Anne Elizabeth Tindall MBE OLY (née Phillips; born 15 May 1981) is a British equestrian, an Olympian and a socialite. She is the daughter of Anne, Princess Royal, and Captain Mark Phillips. She is a granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II and a niece of King Charles III. She was born 6th in the line of succession to the British throne and is now 21st in line. Tindall won the Eventing World Championship in Aachen in 2006. That same year, she was voted 2006 BBC Sports Personality of the Year by the public. In 2012, she carried an Olympic flame at Cheltenham Racecourse on her horse Toytown. As a member of the Great Britain Eventing Team, she won a silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics, presented to her by her mother. She married rugby union player Mike Tindall in 2011. Zara Anne Elizabeth Phillips was born on 15 May 1981 at 8:15 pm in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, London. She was christened on 27 July 1981, at Windsor Castle. Her first name was suggested by her uncle, Charles, the then Prince of Wales. Her godparents are her maternal uncle, the Duke of York; the Countess of Lichfield; Helen, Lady Stewart, the wife of Sir Jackie Stewart; Andrew Parker Bowles; and Hugh Thomas. She has an elder brother, Peter, and two younger half-sisters, Felicity Wade (née Tonkin; from her father's affair with Heather Tonkin) and Stephanie Phillips, from her father's second marriage to Sandy Pflueger. Phillips attended Beaudesert Park School in Stroud, Gloucestershire, and Port Regis School in Shaftesbury, Dorset, before following other members of the royal family in attending Gordonstoun School in Moray, Scotland. During her schooldays, Phillips excelled at many sporting activities, representing her schools in hockey, athletics, and gymnastics. She later studied at the University of Exeter and qualified as a physiotherapist. After university, Phillips began to pursue an equestrian career, in the footsteps of her parents. In June 2003, she announced that she had secured a sponsorship deal with Cantor Index, a leading company in spread betting, to help cover the costs of her equestrian career. She finished as runner-up at Burghley Horse Trials in 2003 in her first four-star event. Tindall missed the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens after her horse suffered an injury during training. Riding her horse Toytown, Tindall collected individual and team gold medals at the 2005 European Eventing Championship in Blenheim, and individual gold and team silver medals at the 2006 FEI World Equestrian Games in Aachen, Germany, making her the reigning Eventing World Champion until 2010. The same year after her win in Germany, she was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year by the British viewing public (an award her mother won in 1971). She was also appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2007 New Year Honours for her services to equestrianism. Despite winning team gold at the 2007 European Eventing Championships in Italy, she failed to defend her individual title in the show-jumping phase of the competition. The British Olympic Association announced that Tindall would ride Toytown for the British equestrian team at the Beijing Olympic Games 2008 in Hong Kong. However, Toytown was injured during training and she was forced to withdraw from the team. On 25 October 2008, Tindall fell from her horse, Tsunami II, at the 15th fence of a cross-country event at Pau, France, and broke her right collarbone. The horse broke her neck after she tipped over the hedge and was put down. In 2009, Tindall announced she was designing her own range of equestrian clothing for Musto Outdoor Clothing. The range is named ZP176 after the team number she was given when she first represented her country. The range was officially launched in July 2010. On 11 June 2012, Tindall was announced as a member of the British Equestrian team for the 2012 London Olympic Games. She competed in the Olympics on High Kingdom and won a silver medal in the team event. Her mother, Princess Anne, presented her medal. Tindall finished second at Luhmühlen Horse Trials 2013, on her top horse High Kingdom. At the World Equestrian Games in 2014, Tindall and High Kingdom were part of the British team that won team silver. Tindall stopped using her maiden name, Phillips, in March 2016. She competed for the first time as Zara Tindall during her unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. In 2017, she won the third place at the Kentucky Three-Day Event on High Kingdom, before High Kingdom retired from the sport in 2018. In November 2019, she was appointed to the non-executive role of director of the Cheltenham Racecourse and began her role in January 2020. In August 2020, Tindall was selected for her first appearance on the British Team competing at the prestigious FEI Nations Cup in Le Pin au Haras, France.

In May 2022, Tindall won the advanced class at the Chatsworth Horse Trials, riding Class Affair. Tindall frequently supports and attends events for various charitable causes, mainly revolving around spinal injuries, equestrianism, and children's causes. In 2005, she auctioned one of her evening gowns, worn at the London premiere of the film Seabiscuit, to raise money for tsunami relief. She also undertook a visit to New Zealand in her role as patron of The Catwalk Trust.

The equestrian themed collection featured the Saddle Suite and the Coronet Suite, with the prices ranging from $6,250 to $44,000. On 17 September 2022, during the period of official mourning for Queen Elizabeth II, Tindall joined her brother and six cousins, to mount a 15-minute vigil, around the coffin of the Queen, as it lay in state at Westminster Hall. On 19 September, with her husband Mike and daughter Mia, she joined other family members at the state funeral. Zara Phillips met rugby union player Mike Tindall, who was playing for the England national team, during their Rugby World Cup-winning campaign in Australia in 2003. On 21 December 2010, Buckingham Palace announced their engagement. As was at that time required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772, the Queen gave her consent to the marriage in a meeting of the Privy Council on 10 May 2011. Mike Tindall proposed to her with "a custom-designed diamond and platinum ring with a divided diamond band". The couple held a celebration on the royal yacht Britannia prior to the wedding. The wedding was held on 30 July 2011 at the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, Scotland, with 400 guests in attendance. The marriage was officiated by the Reverend Neil Gardner. Her off-the-rack ivory silk dress designed by Stewart Parvin featured "a chevron-pleated bodice, a dropped waist, and a 'cathedral-length' train". The Meander Tiara was lent to her and secured the veil. Dolly Maude was her maid of honour, dressed in a dove grey knee length duchess satin dress, with her paternal half-sister, Stephanie, among the bridesmaids. A reception was held at Holyrood Palace following the service. The Tindalls lived in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, before moving to the Princess Royal’s Gatcombe Park estate.
