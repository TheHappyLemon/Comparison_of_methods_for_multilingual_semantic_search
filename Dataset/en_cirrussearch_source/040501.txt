FK Mladá Boleslav is a Czech football club based in the city of Mladá Boleslav. Since 2004, the club has been participating in the Czech First League. Mladá Boleslav were runners up in the 2005–06 Czech First League and went on to play in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, winning their opening tie against Vålerenga although they were eliminated in the third qualifying round by Galatasaray. The club won the Czech Cup in 2011 and qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League, although they were defeated over two legs by AEK Larnaca. The team was promoted to Czech First League for the first time in its history in 2004 and in their first top-flight season fought against relegation, eventually finishing in 14th place. The club's greatest success was achieved in the 2005–06 season, as they finished runners-up in the Czech First League, earning a place in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League. They came through their first tie, defeating Vålerenga (3–1 and 2–2), then lost against Galatasaray (2–5 away, 1–1 home), dropping into the UEFA Cup first round. The club went on to achieve a surprising 4–3 aggregate victory over Marseille (1st leg: 0–1, 2nd leg 4–2). However, the team was eliminated after reaching the group stage, taking just 3 points from 4 matches (Panathinaikos 0–1, Hapoel Tel Aviv 1–1, Paris Saint-Germain 0–0, Rapid București 1–1).[citation needed] The following season, the club qualified directly for the first round of the UEFA Cup after finishing 3rd in the league. (Luboš Pecka was the top goalscorer in the league that year.) Qualification for the group stage was only narrowly secured by beating Palermo 4–2 on penalties after a nail biting 1–1 aggregate scoreline. On the verge of being eliminated with the score reading 1–0 Palermo, (with their goal in the first leg still standing) in the 2nd leg, Tomáš Sedláček scored the winner in the 2nd leg with only seconds to spare. In their group Mladá Boleslav defeated IF Elfsborg 3–1, but again failed to reach the knockout stages of the competition after losing matches against Villarreal 1–2, AEK Athens 0–1 and Fiorentina 1–2. The club subsequently achieved a 7th place league finish in the 2007–08 season, missing out on European qualification.[citation needed] The major sponsor of the club is Škoda Auto. 1902 – SSK Mladá Boleslav (Studentský sportovní klub Mladá Boleslav) 1910 – Mladoboleslavský SK (Mladoboleslavský Sportovní klub) 1919 – Aston Villa Mladá Boleslav 1948 – Sokol Aston Villa Mladá Boleslav 1949 – ZSJ AZNP Mladá Boleslav (Základní sportovní jednota Automobilové závody národní podnik Mladá Boleslav) – merged with Sokol Slavoj Mladá Boleslav and Sokol Meteor Čejetičky 1950 – merged with Sokol Mladoboleslavský 1959 – TJ Spartak Mladá Boleslav AZNP (Tělovýchovná jednota Spartak Mladá Boleslav Automobilové závody národní podnik) 1965 – TJ Škoda Mladá Boleslav (Tělovýchovná jednota Škoda Mladá Boleslav) 1971 – TJ AŠ Mladá Boleslav (Tělovýchovná jednota Auto Škoda Mladá Boleslav) 1990 – FK Mladá Boleslav (Fotbalový klub Mladá Boleslav) 1992 – FK Slavia Mladá Boleslav (Fotbalový klub Slavia Mladá Boleslav) 1994 – FK Bohemians Mladá Boleslav (Fotbalový klub Bohemians Mladá Boleslav) 1995 – FK Mladá Boleslav (Fotbalový klub Mladá Boleslav) As of 29 February 2024.
