Nicolas Jackson (born 20 June 2001) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Chelsea and the Senegal national team. Nicolas Jackson was born in Djibonker, Senegal, in 2001, to a Krio father and Senegalese mother. In 2017, in the aftermath of the 2016 Gambian presidential election, the family moved to Ziguinchor, Senegal. Jackson began playing for local side ASC Tilene before joining Casa Sports, where he was a part of the first team squad during the 2018–19 season. He was also named man of the match in a 1–1 Ligue 1 draw against AS Pikine on 16 November 2018. In September 2019, Jackson agreed to a contract with La Liga side Villarreal, being assigned to the Juvenil A squad. On 5 October 2020, Jackson was loaned to Segunda División side Mirandés for the 2020–21 season. He made his professional debut thirteen days later, coming on as a second-half substitute for Antonio Caballero in a 0–0 home draw against Mallorca. Jackson scored his first professional goal on 28 November 2020, netting the opener in a 1–1 home draw against CD Castellón. It was his only goal of the season, as the Jabatos finished in the 10th position. Upon returning, Jackson played for Villarreal's B-team in Primera División RFEF, scoring seven goals as the side achieved promotion to the second division. He made his first team – and La Liga – debut on 3 October 2021, replacing Arnaut Danjuma late into a 2–0 home win over Real Betis. Jackson scored his first goal in the top tier on 13 August 2022, netting the opener in a 3–0 away success over Real Valladolid. Thirteen days later, he and teammate Álex Baena were promoted to the main squad. In January 2023, Villarreal agreed a £22.5 million deal from AFC Bournemouth for the signing of Jackson but he failed his medical due to hamstring issues. After returning to action in March, he scored nine goals within the months of April and May, which included braces against Celta de Vigo, Athletic Bilbao and Cádiz. On 30 June 2023, Jackson signed for Premier League club Chelsea on an eight-year deal lasting until 2031 for a fee reported to be £32 million. On 13 August, he made his debut for the club in a 1–1 draw against Liverpool in the Premier League. Jackson scored his first Chelsea goal on 25 August 2023 against newly promoted side Luton Town, helping Chelsea to a 3–0 win at Stamford Bridge. He scored his second Chelsea goal in a 1–0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion in the EFL Cup. On 6 November, Jackson scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He scored again in the next match against Manchester City, which ended in a 4–4 home draw. Jackson represented Senegal at under-20 level, receiving his first call-up in November 2018. After being called up to the full side by manager Aliou Cissé for two friendlies in September 2022, Jackson was included in the 26-man list for the 2022 FIFA World Cup on 11 November 2022. He made his full international debut in Senegal's opening match of the competition, replacing Krépin Diatta in a 2–0 loss against the Netherlands. In December 2023, Jackson was named in Senegal's squad for the postponed 2023 Africa Cup of Nations held in the Ivory Coast.
