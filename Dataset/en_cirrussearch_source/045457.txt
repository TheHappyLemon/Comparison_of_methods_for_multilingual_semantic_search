August Kitzberg (29 December [O.S. 17 December] 1855 in Laatre Parish, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire – 10 October 1927 in Tartu) was an Estonian writer. Until 1863, August Kitzberg was known as August Kits. He grew up in Niitsaadu farmstead in Penuja village, Abja Parish (1857–1871), where his brother, Jaak Kits, was a schoolteacher. He worked for a time in Viljandi and present-day Latvia before moving to Tartu in 1901, where he worked as a manager of the newspaper Postimees. His early works consisted of comedies and humorous stories of village life. In Tartu, Kitzberg began working with Karl Menning at the Vanemuine Theatre, and his plays developed a component of social criticism. There is a monument and museum dedicated to Kitzberg in Karksi-Nuia. His play, Tuulte pöörises, was chosen for the opening play of the Rakvere Theatre in 1940.
