This is a list of the world's countries and their dependencies by land, water, and total area, ranked by total area. Entries in this list include, but are not limited to, those in the ISO 3166-1 standard, which includes sovereign states and dependent territories. All 193 member states of the United Nations plus the two observer states are given a rank number. Largely unrecognised states not in ISO 3166-1 are included in the list in ranked order. The areas of such largely unrecognised states are in most cases also included in the areas of the more widely recognised states that claim the same territory; see the notes in the "Notes" column for each country for clarification. Not included in the list are individual country claims to parts of the continent of Antarctica or entities such as the European Union that have some degree of sovereignty but do not consider themselves to be sovereign countries or dependent territories. This list includes three measurements of area: Total area: the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines. Land area: the aggregate of all land within international boundaries and coastlines, excluding water area. Water area: the sum of the surface areas of all inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers) within international boundaries and coastlines. Coastal internal waters may be included. Territorial seas are not included unless otherwise noted. Contiguous zones and exclusive economic zones are not included. Total area is taken from the United Nations Statistics Division unless otherwise noted. Land and water are taken from the Food and Agriculture Organization unless otherwise noted. The CIA World Factbook is most often used when different UN departments disagree. Other sources and details for each entry may be specified in the relevant footnote. Countries portal List of countries and dependencies by population density List of countries and dependencies by population List of largest cities List of largest empires List of political and geographic subdivisions by total area List of sovereign states Orders of magnitude (area) The European Union is a unique supranational union. It covers a total area of 4,236,351 km2, and would be ranked 7th if it were included (3.0% of world's total land area). The largest country in the world, which spans two continents, and most of northern Eurasia; with about 1/9th of the world's total landmass. Russia's European portion is roughly 4,000,000 km2, which is around 40% of the total landmass of Europe, making Russia the largest country in Europe; and its Asian portion, which covers all of Northern Asia, is around 13,100,000 km2, making Russia the largest country in Asia. 98% of the land area is covered by ice and snow. The following countries have territorial claims in Antarctica: Argentina (969,000 km2), Australia (5,896,500 km2), Chile (1,250,000 km2), France (432,000 km2), New Zealand (450,000 km2), Norway (including Peter I Island) (2,500,000 km2) and United Kingdom (1,395,000 km2), which to some extent overlap. The area from 90°W to 150°W (2,100,000 km2) is unclaimed territory. These areas normally have no human inhabitants except scientists. Largest country completely in the Western Hemisphere by total area (second-largest by land area after the United States); with the largest surface area of water; largest contiguous country in North America. Total area and water area figures include area covered by freshwater only and do not include internal waters (non-freshwater) of about 1,600,000 km2, nor territorial waters of 200,000 km2. The United Nations Statistics Division, the CIA World Factbook, and the Encyclopædia Britannica all rank the United States ahead of China in total area. However, the figures used by each source include coastal and territorial waters for the United States but exclude coastal and territorial waters for China. China's coastal and territorial water figures are unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure. But Encyclopædia Britannica specifies the United States' area excluding coastal and territorial waters as 9,525,067 km2, less than the figure given for China's area by any of the three sources. Therefore, while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters, it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters. Largest country entirely in Asia, and second-largest country in the world by land area. Excludes Taiwan, disputed territories with India, and disputed islands in the South China Sea. Figures for total area and water area also exclude all coastal and territorial waters.
