The women's tournament in volleyball at the 2012 Olympic Games in London was the 13th edition of the event in an Olympic Games, organised by the world's governing body, the FIVB, in conjunction with the IOC. It was held at Earls Court Exhibition Centre from 28 July to 11 August 2012. The Asian Qualification Tournament was combined with the World Qualification Tournament. The first 3 place teams of the tournament won the Olympic spots as the winners of the World Qualification Tournament while the best Asian team except the top 3 winners qualify as the Asian Qualification Tournament winners. Teams were seeded following the Serpentine system according to their ranking as of 15 January 2012. Twelve qualified nations were drawn into two groups, each consisting of six teams. After a robin-round, the four highest-placed teams in each group advanced to a knock-out round to decide the medals. Teams played a round-robin schedule within the pool and those with the top four point totals advanced to a knockout round. Teams were awarded three points for a 3–0 or 3–1 win, two points for a 3–2 win, one point for a 3–2 loss, and zero points for a 3–0 or 3–1 loss. If at the end of pool play teams are tied the tiebreakers are (1) most wins, (2) set win ratio, (3) points ratio, and (4) head-to-head. If three or more teams are tied, the tiebreakers are applied only to the matches between tied teams. All times are British Summer Time (UTC+01:00).
