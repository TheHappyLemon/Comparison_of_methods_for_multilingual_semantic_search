On February 7, 2022, he was appointed by President Maia Sandu as Presidential Advisor on Security Issues and Secretary General of the Supreme Security Council. On September 26, 2022, Recean said that "Moldova can no longer rely exclusively on foreign policy instruments, one of which is its neutral status, to ensure state stability," adding that "Moldova must start working on increasing its defence potential... The authorities need to obtain the conscious support of citizens who should understand that it is critical for the state's survival", calling for funds to be allocated to the task. In February 2023, Dorin Recean was appointed Prime Minister of Moldova by President Maia Sandu, following the resignation of Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilița. He was sworn in on February 16, 2023. Since being sworn in, Recean has continued to pursue Moldova's accession to the European Union. On March 1, during the meeting with the Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Ciucă and President Klaus Iohannis, both countries pledged to boost economic ties following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Romania reiterated its support for Moldova's accession to the European Union. On March 14, Recean announced that Moldova had reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a new $94 million tranche under the existing lending program as part of a larger $800 million fund agreed with the IMF in 2022 to help Moldova deal with the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On March 24, Moldova and the European Free Trade Association announced that it had reached an agreement on a comprehensive free trade agreement, after two years of negotiations, allowing Moldova to export goods without paying customs tariffs to the other members. The agreement was signed in Vaduz, the capital of Liechstenstein. At the summit in Switzerland, Recean met with representatives of Liechstenstein, Switzerland, Iceland, and the representatives of Google. On April 6, he thanked the Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki, for expressing his government's support for an accelerated pathway for Moldova's accession to the European Union. On May 18, Recean announced at a security conference in Bucharest that Moldova was no longer using Russian gas or electricity, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, stating that "Moldova is integrated in the European energy network both technically and commercially." On June 26, he commented that the aborted Wagner mutiny in Russia "is a clear indication of the weakness of the Russian leadership and the Russian management of the army" and that "Russia is much weaker than people perceived it to be". He also stated in regards to the Transnistrian conflict that "first of all Moldova will solve this Transdniestria issue peacefully". "This is fundamental. The first thing is to demilitarise the region where Russian troops are stationed illegally. This will most likely happen when Russians are pushed out of Ukraine." Recean supports Moldova's membership to the EU and closer ties with the West. Right after his official nomination, Recean declared: "The new government will have three priorities: order and discipline, revitalizing economy, and peace and stability. The new government will continue the implementation of Moldova's strategic course – integration to the European Union." Recean is married and has two children. He speaks English, French, and Russian in addition to his native Romanian. Recean also holds Romanian citizenship and self-identifies as an ethnic Romanian.
