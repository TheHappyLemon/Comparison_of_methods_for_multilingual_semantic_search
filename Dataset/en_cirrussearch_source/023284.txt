Due to his risky and spectacular style which produces relatively few draws, Morozevich is popular among chess fans. In 2007, Morozevich published, along with co-author Vladimir Barsky, a book about the Chigorin Defense, called The Chigorin Defence According to Morozevich. Morozevich is considered to be one of the best blindfold chess players in the world. He has confirmed that status in blindfold sections of Melody Amber tournaments: 2002 first 9/11, 2003 shared second 7/11, 2004 first 8½/11, 2005 shared second 6/11, 2006 first 9½/11, 2007 shared second 7/11, 2008 shared first 6/11 and in 2009 shared fourth with Anand 6½/11.
