The 2017 World Figure Skating Championships were held 29 March – 2 April 2017 in Helsinki, Finland. The host was named in June 2014. Medals were awarded in the disciplines of men's singles, ladies' singles, pairs, and ice dancing. The event also determined the number of entries for each country at the 2018 World Championships and the 2018 Winter Olympics. Hartwall Arena's main arena, with an ice surface measuring 60 m x 30 m, was used for all competitions and several practice sessions. The rest of the practice sessions took place at Hartwall Arena's practice rink (58 m x 28 m) and Pirkkola ice rink (for pairs, 60 m x 30 m). Hartwall Arena's main rink and practice rink facilities are in the same venue. Pirkkola practice rink is about four kilometres from Hartwall Arena. The following new ISU best scores were set during this competition: Participants were required to have attained minimum technical element scores at an earlier senior international competition.
