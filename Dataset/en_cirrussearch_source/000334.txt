Along with Novgorod-Seversky, Putivlem and Rylsk, it was one of the cities of the historical Severshchina. Archaeological research indicates the early settlement of the territory of Sevsk. Sevsk is first mentioned under 1146 in two chronicles — Resurrection and Ipatievskaya. At that time, the city was part of the Chernihiv-Seversk land. In the reign of Ivan the Terrible The Sevsky Kremlin was fortified, garrison reinforced by guard Cossacks, who created a Cossack sloboda here. In the middle of the 17th century a Sev fortress was included in the system of newly created defensive guards along the south-western borders. The convenient location contributed to the creation of a strong fortress here, which played a significant role in the history of Russia. Sevsk was known as a major shopping center not only in Russia, but also in the West. In 1634, the siege of Sevsk / defense of Sevsk from the Poles played an important role in ending the Smolensk War. After 1683 and the city grew many times at the expense of streltsy and other service people, sent here from Moscow after Streletsky Revolt (1682)/ streltsy riots. At the end of the XVII century, a silver coin was minted in Sevsk for Ukrainian territories that became part of Russia — Sevsk Czechs. In 1687 at Sevsk, the 32nd [[Chernihiv Colonel] was beheaded]] Grigory Samoilovich (son of hetman a Ivan Samoilovich). In the XVIII century, the defensive importance of Sevsk as a border town weakened, as the borders were moved to the south and west. It organizes the civil administration. The city was granted a coat of arms and a general development plan. Military people are settling on the outskirts of the city. In Sevsk and its environs, there are still Streletskaya, Pushkarnaya, Soldatskaya Sloboda, and the village of Reitarovka. With the division of Russia into provinces, Sevsk was included in the Kiev province, in which in 1719 became the center of Sevsk province, which included 9 cities: Sevsk, Trubchevsk, Bryansk, Karachev, Kromy, Rylsk, Putivl, Nedrigailov and Kamenny with their districts (uyezds). In 1727 Sevsk was transferred to Belgorod province, divided into three provinces, of which Sevsk province was the most populous (out of the 700 thousand population of the province, it accounted for 300 thousand). In 1778 Sevsk becomes the center of Sevsky uyezd as part of Orel Viceroyalty. At this time, it was decided to rebuild the city according to a new plan, breaking it into regular squares. The inhabitants of the city were engaged in crafts, trade and Yamsky craft. In the 1880s, the first railway line ran through Sevsky uyezd, but Sevsk itself was left out of it, which affected the development of industry and trade. At the same time, much has been done in the improvement of the city: water supply was carried out, the central streets were gas-lit, the main street was paved with cobblestones. In the eastern part of the city, on the high bank of the Seva, a building of the zemstvo council was built. In the north-western part of the city in 1913, a large two-story building was erected, specially designed for the Sevsky Real School, established in 1909. The school became one of the cultural centers of the city, where literary evenings were held, concerts were arranged, and amateur performances were staged. In 1917, the mathematician Ivan Petrovsky, future rector of Moscow State University, graduated from the school. 1 October 1941 as part of Operation Typhoon 2nd panzer group Guderian, Heinz Wilhelm / Guderian Army Group "Center" broke through the defense of its central sector 13th army Of the Bryansk Front A.
