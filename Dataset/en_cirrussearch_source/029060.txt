With an urban population of 1,064,077, Durg-Bhilai is the second largest urban area in Chhattisgarh after Raipur. It is the headquarters of Durg District. The town was founded about the tenth century by a person named Jagpal, who originally came from Badhal Desh in Mirzapur, and became treasury officer of the Kalachuri king of Chhattisgarh. He was rewarded the land grant of Durg with 700 villages for his excellent services and later helped the Kalachuri king greatly in his conquests. The original name of the town was "Shiva Durg", literally meaning fort on the Shivnath River. Durg used to have a fort that was the headquarters of one of the 18 Garhs or districts under the administration of the medieval Kalachuri kings. Alexander Cunningham, a prominent British archeologist, thought Durg must have been a place of some importance in medieval times as it name literally means "fort".
