Tomáš Necid (Czech pronunciation: [ˈtomaːʃ ˈnɛtsɪt]; born 13 August 1989) is a Czech professional footballer who plays as a striker for Bohemians 1905. He is the older brother of Simona Necidová, who is also an international footballer. Necid played his first match for the senior team of SK Slavia Prague in September 2006, when he was just 17 years old. A month later, he scored his first league goal. In the 2007–08 season, Necid made his debut in the UEFA Champions League, however, he was loaned to FK Jablonec for the second half of the season. Despite playing only 14 matches (of 30), he was Jablonec's top scorer of the season with five goals. When Necid came to FK Jablonec they were in 15th place (out of 16), which means relegation to a lower league. Nevertheless, the team finished the season in 12th place, and therefore survived, with Necid being one of the heroes of the team. When his loan came to an end, he stated he wanted to return to Slavia and did not want to play for Jablonec again. At the end of the season, in his first match for Slavia after his return from Jablonec, he scored a goal against Liberec. Slavia Prague won the 2007–08 Gambrinus liga. In 2008, he won the Talent of the Year award at the Czech Footballer of the Year awards. Necid played 16 games in the 2008–09 Gambrinus liga and scored 11 goals (which was making him the season's top league scorer at the time he left). In August 2008, CSKA Moscow, who had been interested in Necid since 2006, signed a deal with Slavia Prague according to which Necid would stay at Slavia until the end of the year and would join CSKA in January 2009. He made his competitive debut for CSKA Moscow on 7 March 2009 in the 2009 Russian Super Cup, where he came on as a substitute in the 78th minute and scored the winning goal for his team in extra time of the match.[citation needed] In June 2011, Necid suffered a knee injury that required two operations and it sidelined him for 22 months (until April 2013).[citation needed] Necid signed for PAOK for the 2013–14 season to gain more playing time.[citation needed] On 6 January 2014, Slavia Prague announced signing Necid on loan to the end of 2013–14 season. In August 2014, he was sent on loan to Dutch Eredivisie side PEC Zwolle. His loan ended in January 2015 and he returned to CSKA Moscow. After being linked with Chievo Verona, Necid dissolved his contract with CSKA on 2 February 2015.[citation needed] Necid returned to PEC Zwolle as a free agent in February 2015, signing a contract until the end of the 2014–15 season. On 2 July 2015, Necid signed four-year contract for Turkish Süper Lig side Bursaspor. He came the club for a key role in filling the shoes of top goalscorer from 2014–15 season, Fernandão. On 30 January 2017, Necid was loaned to Legia Warsaw for a half-year. On 1 September 2017, he rejoined Slavia Prague on a season-long loan deal. On 9 May 2018, he played as Slavia Prague won the 2017–18 Czech Cup final against FK Jablonec. He left Slavia after the loan was over. On 28 August 2018, Necid joined Dutch side ADO Den Haag on a two-year contract after his Bursaspor contract was dissolved. On 12 October 2020, Necid joined Bohemians 1905 as a free agent and signed a contract until the end of the season. He finished as a joined top scorer with five goals in five games scored at the 2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship, where the Czech Republic won a silver medal. He became the top scorer of 2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship, with four goals in four games. At that tournament the Czech Republic reached the semi-final. His first match with the senior team took place on 19 November 2008, in a qualification match against San Marino. The Czech national football team won 3–0, with Necid scoring the third goal.
