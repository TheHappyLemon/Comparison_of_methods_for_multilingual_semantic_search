Jaipur (/ˈdʒaɪpʊər/ , Hindi: [ˈdʒeəpʊr]) is the capital and the largest city of the north-western Indian state of Rajasthan. As of 2011[update], the city has a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Located 268 km (167 miles) from the national capital New Delhi, Jaipur is also known as the Pink City due to the dominant color scheme of its buildings in old city. Jaipur was founded in 1727 by Sawai Jai Singh II, the Kachhwaha Rajput ruler of Amer, after whom the city is named. It is one of the earliest planned cities of modern India, designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya. During the British colonial period, the city served as the capital of Jaipur State. After Indian independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan in 1949. Jaipur is a popular tourist destination in India, forming a part of the west Golden triangle tourist circuit along with Delhi and Agra. The city serves as a gateway to other tourist destinations in Rajasthan like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Udaipur, Kota, Mount Abu and has two World heritage sites of Amer Fort and Jantar Mantar. On 6 July 2019, the city was named to the World Heritage Cities list. Jaipur derives its name from Sawai Jai Singh II (1693-1744), the ruler of Amer, who founded the city in 1727. In Sanskrit, variations of the word "pur" or "pura" are commonly used to refer to a city or town with "Jaipur" essentially meaning "The City of Jai" or "Jai's City," paying homage to Maharaja Jai Singh II, who established the city. Jaipur was founded by Rajput chief of Kachhwaha clan Jai Singh II on 18 November 1727, who ruled the region from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amber, 11 kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur to accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water. Jai Singh consulted with several architects while planning the layout of Jaipur and established the city on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra under the architectural guidance of Vidyadhar Bhattacharya. The construction of the city began in 1726. During the rule of Sawai Ram Singh II, the city was painted pink to welcome Albert Edward, Prince of Wales in 1876. Many of the avenues still remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city. In the 19th century, the city grew rapidly and had a population of 160,000 in 1900. The wide boulevards were paved and its chief industries were the working of metals and marble, fostered by a school of art founded in 1868. In August 1981, large areas of the city including the airport were flooded due to heavy rains from a cloud burst, resulting in the death of eight people and much damage to the city's Dravyavati River. On 6 July 2019, the city was named to the World Heritage Cities list. Jaipur is located in the northeastern part of Rajasthan and covers a total area of 467 square kilometres (180 sq mi).
