Georges Ronsse (4 March 1906, Antwerp - 4 July 1969, Berchem) was a two-time national cyclo-cross and two-time world champion road bicycle racer from Belgium, who raced between 1926 and 1938. In addition to his several national and world championships, Ronsse won several of the classic races in road cycling including the 1925 Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the 1927 Paris–Roubaix, and the 1927, 1929 and 1930 editions of the now-defunct Bordeaux–Paris. He won his first world championship title in 1928 in Budapest with a lead of 19 minutes and 43 seconds over second-placed finisher Herbert Nebe, the largest winning margin in road world championship history. In 1932, Ronsse capped off his career with a Stage 4 win at the 1932 Tour de France. After retiring from competition he served as manager of the Belgian national team at the Tour. 1925 1st Liège–Bastogne–Liège 1st Schaal Sels 6th Overall Tour of Belgium Independents 1st Stage 6 1926 3rd Championship of Flanders 3rd Omloop der Leiestreek 1927 1st Paris–Roubaix 1st Bordeaux–Paris 1st Scheldeprijs 1st Circuit of North-Belgium 3rd Paris–Tours 6th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 9th Tour of Flanders 1928 1st Road race, UCI World Championships 1st Paris–Brussels 1st Rupelmonde 2nd Paris–Roubaix 3rd Circuit de Paris (fr) 1929 1st Road race, UCI World Championships 1st Bordeaux–Paris 2nd Belgian National Road Race Championships 2nd Tour of Flanders 2nd Paris–Roubaix 3rd Paris–Tours 1930 1st Bordeaux–Paris 1st Nationale Sluitingsprijs 1st GP Wolber 1st Antwerp–Brussels–Antwerp 2nd Circuit du Midi 3rd Road race, UCI World Championships 6th Paris–Tours 6th Paris–Roubaix 1931 2nd Circuit de Paris (fr) 3rd Paris–Lille (fr) 3rd GP Wolber 4th Paris–Roubaix 1932 Tour de France Winner stage 4 5th place overall classification 2nd Paris–Roubaix 3rd Paris–Brussels 1933 1st GP Stad Antwerpen 3rd Overall Tour of Belgium 1st Stage 1 & 4 1927 2nd National Championships 1928 2nd National Championships 2nd Critérium International de Cyclo-cross (fr) 1929 1st National Championships 1930 1st National Championships 2nd Critérium International de Cyclo-cross (fr) 1931 3rd Critérium International de Cyclo-cross (fr) 1933 1st Cyclo-cross championship of Antwerp 1934 1st Motor-paced Belgian National Track Championships (fr) 1935 1st Motor-paced Belgian National Track Championships (fr) 3rd Motor-paced, UCI Track World Championships, Brussels 1936 1st Motor-paced Belgian National Track Championships (fr) 3rd Motor-paced, UCI Track World Championships, Zürich 3rd Six Days of Antwerp (with Adolf Schön) 1937 3rd Motor-paced Belgian National Track Championships (fr) 3rd Six Days of Antwerp (with Maurice Depauw) 1938 2nd Motor-paced Belgian National Track Championships (fr) "Georges Ronsse".
