It is administered by NIC.AC, a subsidiary of the Internet Computer Bureau based in the United Kingdom. Registration for the domain is open to anyone. The registry accepts registrations of internationalized domain names. The domain is marketed by some domain-brokers as a domain for the city of Aachen, Germany, after the automotive license plate designation ("AC") for the city.
