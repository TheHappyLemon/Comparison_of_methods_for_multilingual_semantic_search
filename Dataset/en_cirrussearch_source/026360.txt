Agin-Buryat Autonomous Okrug (Buryat: Агын Буряадай автономито тойрог) was a federal subject of the Russian Federation. On 1 March 2008, the region merged with Chita Oblast (which it was surrounded by) to form the new Zabaykalsky Krai. The territory of the former ABAO is now the Agin-Buryat Okrug of Zabaykalsky Krai, in which it has a special status. The district was first created in its modern form on 26 September 1937 as the Agin Buryat-Mongol National Okrug within Chita Oblast. Following the change of the ethnonym "Buryat-Mongol" to "Buryat" on 16 September 1958, the region was renamed to Agin-Buryat National Okrug, and became the Agin-Buryat Autonomous Okrug" on 7 October 1977. From 31 March 1992, the district was both an independent federal subject of Russia and a part of Chita Oblast until it was abolished on 1 March 2008. Work on merging the region with Chita Oblast began in April 2006. The authorities of both regions sent a letter to president Vladimir Putin who supported this initiative to merge the two regions. The merger referendum was held on 11 March 2007. In Agin-Buryat Autonomous Okrug, 94% (38,814 people) supported the merger, 5.16% (2,129 people) were against. 82.95% of the population of the autonomous okrug took part in the referendum. In Chita Oblast, 90.29% (535,045 people) supported the merger, 8.89% (52,698 people) were against. 72.82% of the population of the oblast took part in the referendum. As a result of the majority of voters in both regions supporting the unification of the two regions, Zabaykalsky Krai was formed on 1 March 2008. The autonomous okrug had three districts: Aginsky District Duldurginsky District Mogoytuysky District "Сведения о проводящихся выборах и референдумах". www.chita.vybory.izbirkom.ru.
