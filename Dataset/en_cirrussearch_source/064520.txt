Kim Min-jae (Korean: 김민재; born 15 November 1996) is a South Korean professional footballer who plays primarily as a centre-back for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich and the South Korea national team. Nicknamed the Monster, Kim is considered one of the best defenders in the world. Kim was born in Tongyeong. Both of his parents are former athletes and his brother was also a footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Myongji University [ko]. Kim embarked on his youth football career with the football club of Tongyeong Elementary School. He later transferred to Gaya Elementary School in Haman and graduated from there. He entered Yeoncho Middle School and Suwon Technical High School [ko] which has produced many international footballers such as Park Ji-sung. After he graduated from high school in 2015, he went on to Yonsei University [ko]. In July 2016, when he was a sophomore, he dropped out of school to fulfill his dream of making his professional debut, although Yonsei University tried to dissuade him. Kim joined semi-professional club Gyeongju KHNP on 1 July 2016, and participated in the Korea National League from the middle of the 2016 season. Kim played 15 matches for KHNP until the end of the regular season, leading his team to the play-offs. On 2 November, Kim played the quarter-final game of the play-offs for 78 minutes, contributing to a 2–0 victory over Changwon City. On 5 November, however, he failed to help KHNP advance to the final despite playing as a full-time player in the semi-final game against Hyundai Mipo Dockyard. On 22 December 2016, Kim joined K League club Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors on a free transfer. Jeonbuk manager Choi Kang-hee expressed his expectancy about him during the pre-season training camps in Dubai, and used him as a key player from the beginning. Kim made his debut goal for his career in a K League 1 match against Daegu FC on 25 June 2017. He scored his second goal for Jeonbuk against Gwangju FC with a mid-range volley on 19 August. He was ousted from the game against Sangju Sangmu for warnings accumulated on 20 September. On 15 October, it turned out that Kim suffered a semilunar valve injury and for this reason Kim had to have surgery in Japan, being unable to play remaining games of the season. With his performance, he was named the K League Young Player of the Year and nominated for a part of the K League Best XI, although he was shown nine yellow cards and one red card during 29 appearances. Kim made his first AFC Champions League debut in a 3–2 victory over Kashiwa Reysol on 13 February 2018. Kim scored his first goal of the 2018 season with a header as well as showing strong defense in a K League 1 match against FC Seoul on 18 March, and was named the MVP of the week. Afterwards, he led Jeonbuk's defense to six consecutive clean sheets. Unfortunately, however, Kim suffered from a fibula injury in a match against Daegu FC on 2 May, absenting himself from the 2018 FIFA World Cup. On 29 January 2019, Kim transferred to Beijing Sinobo Guoan. With his impressive defensive performance, Kim went on to play an integral role in Beijing's runner-up finish in the 2019 CSL Season. In May 2020, Kim engendered controversy by expressing dissatisfaction about Beijing teammates' method of play in a YouTube channel, which was being operated by a South Korean football commentator, after his wedding in South Korea. At a similar time, he received intensive attention from a wide range of European clubs, and Tottenham Hotspur manager José Mourinho tried to recruit him. However, Tottenham didn't want to pay more than €5 million for Kim, and it failed to negotiate with Beijing, which demanded €10 million. Kim transferred to Fenerbahçe on 16 August 2021 with a transfer fee of €3 million and signed a 4-year contract. Kim won the most number of unclaimed balls and won the most tackles among Fenerbahçe defenders in his first match for Fenerbahçe against Antalyaspor on 22 August. He made his European debut in the UEFA Europa League Group D match against Eintracht Frankfurt on 16 September. Two days after receiving his first red card in the Süper Lig against Trabzonspor on 17 October, Kim said "This was a first for me in my five-year career playing football at the highest level, I guess we have to have such experiences in Turkey." Kim led Fenerbahçe to a 2–1 victory by making the most passes and blocks in the Intercontinental Derby on 21 November, and was selected as the man of the match by Fenerbahçe fans with 76.3 percent of the votes. Kim scored his first goal for Fenerbahçe against Konyaspor on 20 March 2022. At the end of the 2021–22 season, International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES), FIFA 22 and Opta Sports selected Kim for the Süper Lig Team of the Season. On 27 July 2022, Kim signed for Serie A club Napoli for a reported fee of €18 million, as a replacement for Kalidou Koulibaly, who departed to join Chelsea. On 21 August, he scored his first goal for Napoli from a header in stoppage time during a 4–0 victory over Monza. In his second month in Italy, he was named Serie A Player of the Month for September 2022. During his first season playing for Napoli, Kim was an integral part of Napoli's victory to its third Serie A title in the 2022–23 season, the first one in nearly three decades, being named the Serie A Best Defender of the season. On 18 July 2023, Bundesliga club Bayern Munich announced that they had signed Kim on a deal until 30 June 2028. Bayern reportedly triggered a release clause in Kim's Napoli contract by paying €58 million, and so Kim became the most expensive Asian footballer in history by surpassing Shoya Nakajima's transfer fee of €35 million. He is the second South Korean player to sign with the club, the first being Jeong Woo-yeong. He scored his first goal for Bayern with a header as well as keeping a clean sheet in a 3–0 victory over VfB Stuttgart on 17 December. On 14 August 2017, Kim was named in South Korea's squad for the last two qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup against Iran and Uzbekistan. In a qualifier against Iran on 31 August 2017, Kim made his international debut as a starter and sent off Iranian player Saeid Ezatolahi as well as showing great defense for 84 minutes. On 5 September, Kim played as a full-time player against Uzbekistan, helping South Korea keep one more clean sheet. After these matches, South Korea qualified for the ninth consecutive FIFA World Cup. However, he suffered an injury on 8 May 2018 and was unable to take part in that year's World Cup. On 1 September 2018, South Korea defeated Japan 2–1 in the gold medal match of the 2018 Asian Games. As a result of this victory, Kim and his teammates received an exemption from military service, reducing the two-year conscription to just a few weeks of basic training, which he later served in the summer of 2023. On 12 November 2022, Kim was named in the South Korea squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He helped his team keep clean sheet against Uruguay, but was criticized for his performances against Ghana and Brazil, with the latter eliminating South Korea in round of 16, following a 4–1 defeat. Kim played for the national team under manager Jürgen Klinsmann in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, helping his nation reach the semi-finals, where they lost 2–0 to Jordan. As a central defender, Kim has excellent physical attributes, notably his strength, speed, height, and flexibility. Kim has a strong predictive ability in defense, and can often start and finish plays when the team advances. His long pass accuracy enables him to immediately hit the ball after the steal to complete a quick counterattack, and his excellent aerial ability and positioning allows him to perform headers to break up opposition attacks and start offensive plays. Typically, Kim positions himself as the rearmost player in his team's defensive formation. This strategic placement affords him ample time to decide whether to hold his position or confront the opposition. Despite his tendency to stay back, Kim exhibits a proactive and aggressive approach in winning possession beyond his defensive line. His blend of speed and physical strength makes him highly effective in regaining control for his team. In January 2021, Kim was appointed as an ambassador for the Purme Foundation. He decided to contribute to the rehabilitation of children with disabilities and the independence of young people with disabilities, and donated ₩50 million (€38,000 of January 2021).
