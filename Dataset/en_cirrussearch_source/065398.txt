ASAP Mob (stylized as A$AP Mob, ASAP being an acronym for "Always Strive And Prosper") is an American hip hop collective formed in 2006 in Harlem, New York City, that consists of rappers (all of whom carry the "ASAP" moniker except Playboi Carti), record producers, music video directors and fashion designers. In August 2012, the collective released the mixtape Lords Never Worry. They released the single "Trillmatic" in December 2013, followed by their debut studio album, Cozy Tapes Vol. 1: Friends, in October 2016. In 2006, Steven Rodriguez, professionally known as A$AP Yams, formed the collective with fellow New Yorkers A$AP Bari and A$AP Illz. Harlem rapper A$AP Rocky joined later. In the summer of 2011, the group released music videos for Rocky's singles "Peso" and "Purple Swag," produced by A$AP Ty Beats. Rocky followed up with his mixtape Live.Love.A$AP in October,[citation needed] signing a record deal with Sony Music Entertainment that month. On August 27, 2012, A$AP Mob released their debut project, a mixtape titled Lords Never Worry, as a free download. From September to November, Rocky toured with opening acts Schoolboy Q, Danny Brown, and A$AP Mob in support of his solo debut album. In January 2013, A$AP Ferg signed a joint venture deal with RCA and Polo Grounds, which released his single "Work" for retail on iTunes. An official remix of "Work", featuring Rocky, French Montana, Schoolboy Q and Trinidad James, followed. Rocky's debut album Long. Live. A$AP, was released on January 15, 2013, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 139,000 copies in the United States. A$AP Ferg announced that A$AP Mob would release their debut album after the release of his solo debut album Trap Lord, on August 20, 2013. The album peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 and number four on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with first-week sales of 32,000 copies in the United States. In November 2013, A$AP Rocky announced that A$AP Mob's debut album would be titled Lords. On December 4, 2013, the album's first single, entitled "Trillmatic." The album title was then changed to L.O.R.D. On January 13, 2014, the single "See Me" by A$AP Ant was released. On September 26, 2014, A$AP Yams revealed that L.O.R.D. had been shelved. On January 18, 2015, A$AP Mob revealed that A$AP Yams had died of acute mixed drug intoxication. On October 15, 2016, A$AP Rocky confirmed that the group's compilation album Cozy Tapes Vol. 1: Friends was completed. Dedicated to A$AP Yams, the album was released on October 31, 2016, and featured several artists, including Playboi Carti, Skepta and Tyler, The Creator.
