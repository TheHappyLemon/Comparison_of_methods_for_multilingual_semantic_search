He is the owner of the record label Yellow Productions. A native of Paris, Le Friant began DJing in the 1980s under the name Chris the French Kiss. During this time he was more influenced by hip hop and jazz music and created music projects such as The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, the latter with an ensemble of musicians and where Le Friant used the alias Desmond K. In 1998 Le Friant adopted name of Bob Sinclar after the titular character from the 1973 film Le Magnifique. He became known for popularising the "French touch" of house music with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. He describes his musical style as inspired by "peace, love, and house music".

In 2009, he released "Lala Song" with the band The Sugarhill Gang, a remix of the band's 1979 hit "Rapper's Delight", that was one of the very early hip hop songs and the first to hit the top 40 charts. In the 2010s, Sinclar became a very prolific music producer.
