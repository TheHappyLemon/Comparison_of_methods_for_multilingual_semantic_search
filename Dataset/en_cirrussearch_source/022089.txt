DD-WRT is Linux-based firmware for wireless routers and access points. Originally designed for the Linksys WRT54G series, it now runs on a wide variety of models. DD-WRT is one of a handful of third-party firmware projects designed to replace manufacturer's original firmware with custom firmware offering additional features or functionality. Sebastian Gottschall, a.k.a. "BrainSlayer", is the founder and primary maintainer of the DD-WRT project. The letters "DD" in the project name are the German license-plate letters for vehicles from Dresden, where the development team lived. The remainder of the name was taken from the Linksys WRT54G model router, a home router popular in 2002–2004. WRT is assumed to be a reference to 'wireless router'. Buffalo Technology and other companies have shipped routers with factory-installed, customized versions of DD-WRT. In January 2016, Linksys started to offer DD-WRT firmware for their routers. Among the common features of DD-WRT are access control bandwidth monitoring quality of service WPA/WPA2/WPA3 (personal and enterprise) iptables and IPset (on some models) & SPI firewall Universal Plug and Play Wake-on-LAN Dynamic DNS AnchorFree VPN wireless access point configuration WDS - Wireless Distribution System multiple SSIDs overclocking transmission power control Transmission BitTorrent client Tor router linking ssh telnet RADIUS support XLink Kai networks OpenVPN WireGuard "Micro" builds additionally require 128 kB of Common Firmware Environment storage Smaller VPN JFFS builds are available for 4 MB units. Only on DD-WRT v24 It is also possible to build a bespoke firmware package. DD-WRT supports many different router models, both new and obsolete. The project maintains a full list of currently supported models and known incompatible devices.
