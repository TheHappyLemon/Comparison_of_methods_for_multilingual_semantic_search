Klāvs Bethers (born 24 December 2003) is a Latvian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Italian Serie C Group C club Catania and the Latvian national under-21 team. Bethers started his career in his native Latvia with FK Liepāja, then making his senior debut in the 2020 Latvian First League with Grobiņas SC. In January 2022, he left Latvia to move to Italy, joining Sicilian Serie D amateur club Città di Sant'Agata. Following that, he was signed by Serie C club Piacenza, who then loaned him out to Catania for the 2022–23 Serie D season, where Bethers played as a regular and won promotion to Serie C. In 2023, Catania signed Bethers permanently from Piacenza. Despite the acquisition of a more experienced goalkeeper in Alessandro Livieri, Bethers managed to confirm himself as the first choice for Catania in his role also during the 2023–24 Serie C season.
