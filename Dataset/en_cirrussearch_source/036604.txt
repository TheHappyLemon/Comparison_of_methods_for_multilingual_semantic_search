Hydroiodic acid (or hydriodic acid) is a colorless and aqueous solution of hydrogen iodide (HI). It is a strong acid, which is ionized completely in an aqueous solution. Concentrated solutions of hydroiodic acid are usually 48% to 57% HI. Hydroiodic acid reacts with oxygen in air to give iodine: 4 HI + O2 → 2 H 2O + 2 I2 Like other hydrogen halides, hydroiodic acid adds to alkenes to give alkyl iodides. It can also be used as a reducing agent, for example in the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds to anilines. The Cativa process is a major end use of hydroiodic acid, which serves as a co-catalyst for the production of acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol. Hydroiodic acid is listed as a U.S. Federal DEA List I Chemical, owing to its use as a reducing agent related to the production of methamphetamine from ephedrine or pseudoephedrine (recovered from nasal decongestant pills).
