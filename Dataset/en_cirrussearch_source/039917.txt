Before the 2013 season, the club submitted an application to play in the A Lyga, as all three top finishers decided against seeking promotion, promising to play games in Vilnius before adequate infrastructure requirements could be fulfilled, but ultimately remained in the same tier. They were promoted to A Lyga after finishing 3rd in the 2013 LFF I Lyga season. The club also reached the semi-finals of the 2013–14 Lithuanian Football Cup, before being eliminated by the eventual winners, VMFD Žalgiris. During summer, the club organized youth camps with invitees from AC Milan. The club began preparation for the 2014 campaign by strengthening their first team, which included signing Lithuanian national team veterans, Paulius Grybauskas, Vytautas Lukša, Darius Miceika, and Tadas Labukas, as well as unveiling former star Edgaras Jankauskas as their new head coach. They debuted in the A Lyga victoriously, beating Klaipėdos Granitas 2–0. Throughout the season, the club's results plateaued, but they managed to climb up to second place around the mid-season break. Trakai continued to strengthen their core and staff personnel through mid-season. On 19 September 2014, another national team star, Deividas Česnauskis, was signed on. Soon afterwards, the club was eliminated from the 2014–15 Lithuanian Football Cup by Šilas. With 7 matches remaining, Trakai was still in 2nd place in the league, but a losing streak followed. On 3 November 2014, Jankauskas was fired by the club. Virmantas Lemežis took over as caretaker and managed to stabilize things. As a result, the team finished in 4th place, qualifying for the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League. On 27 November 2014, Trakai announced the signing of the former Ekranas manager, Valdas Urbonas, as development director, but during the club's season roundup event, he was announced as new manager for the upcoming season. The Trakai reserve team also finished third in the A Lyga's reserves competitions that season. In 2015, some veteran players left the team. On 2 July 2015, FK Trakai debuted in the UEFA Europa League qualification round against HB Torshavn from the Faroe Islands. Trakai won 7–1. However, the club lost in the Europa League's second qualifying round to the Cypriot club Apollon Limassol. In the first leg, Trakai lost 4–0, while in the second leg, they drew 0–0. In the 2015 A Lyga season, Trakai reached second place and became the vice-champion of Lithuania and qualified to 2016–17 UEFA Europa League's first qualifying round. It was the club's most successful season yet. Before the 2016 A Lyga season, the top 2015 season defenders, Linas Klimavičius, Edvardas Gaurilovas, Nikolaz Apakitze, Sergej Shevchuk, Marius Šalkauskas, Ronald Solomin and Rokas Stanulevičius, left the team. But the team managed to keep last season's leaders, Yuri Mamaev, Marius Rapalis, and Deividas Česnauskis. Trakai could keep the core of the team and signed contracts with a few newcomers. The team signed a legionnaire from Italy, Mattia Broli, and former Lithuanian national football players, Arūnas Klimavičius, and Martynas Dapkus. In the 2015–16 Lithuanian Cup, Trakai reached the final after beating FK Sūduva in the semi-finals, but lost the final 0–1 against FK Žalgiris after extra time. Like in the previous season, they finished the 2016 A Lyga campaign in second place. Trakai started the 2017 A Lyga with newly appointed head coach Oleg Vasilenko. They reached third place at the end of the season, and reached the quarter-finals of the 2017 Lithuanian Football Cup, where they lost 1–4 against FK Sūduva. In 2018, the team saw a change in coaching. In May, Oleg Vasilenko was fired, and Kibu Vicuña was hired as the team's head coach.

In January 2020, Mindaugas Čepas was appointed as the new head coach of the team. In the 2020 season, Riteriai was one of only six competing teams in the A Lyga, since several teams were excluded from the league by the Lithuanian Football Federation due to manipulation of the match results in the 2019 season. Riteriai started the 2020 season on 8 March with a 0–3 defeat against Kauno Žalgiris. Afterwards, the league was suspended for over two months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. League play resumed on 30 May 2020, and on the second matchday, Riteriai beat FK Žalgiris 1–0. But only one month later, on 28 June, Riteriai suffered a devastating 0–7 defeat against FK Žalgiris, which lead to the resignation of manager Čepas. On August 11, Tommi Pikkarainen was appointed as the new head coach. At the end of the season, Riteriai only won two out of 20 league games and collected 12 points. They finished the league campaign in last place. However, since the Lithuanian Football Federation wanted to expand the A Lyga to ten competing teams, no team was relegated, and Riteriai remained in the A Lyga in the 2021 season. In the 2020 Lithuanian Football Cup, Riteriai reached the semi-finals, where they were defeated 0–4 by FK Panevėžys. Prior to the start of the 2021 A Lyga, Sergei Gurenko was appointed as the new manager of Riteriai. He left the club at the end of May. Prior to his departure, the team dropped to sixth place in A Lyga after earning only two points in the last five matches under Gurenko. Riteriai finished the season in sixth place.

In the 2022 Lithuanian Football Cup, Riteriai reached the quarter-finals, where they were defeated 1–2 by FK Žalgiris. In the 2022 A Lyga, they reached fifth place. After a poor start to the 2023 season with only one point out of the first four league matches, Villar was sacked on 24 March 2023. He was succeeded by Vladimir Janković on 31 March. On 25 July, Janković was sacked. Portuguese coach Matthew Silva, who coached the Riteriai B team (second team) in the I Lyga, was promoted to be the head coach of the first team one day later. In the 2023 Lithuanian Football Cup, Riteriai reached the quarter-finals, where they were defeated 0–2 by FA Šiauliai. The club ended the 2023 league campaign in the last place and therefore was relegated to the second division after ten consecutive seasons in the first division.
