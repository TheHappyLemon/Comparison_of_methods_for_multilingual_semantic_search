"Legends" is a song by American rapper Juice WRLD. It was released as the second single from his EP Too Soon.. on June 22, 2018, three days after the EP's release. The song is a homage to two deceased rappers – Lil Peep, who died by overdose on November 15, 2017, and XXXTentacion, a friend of Juice WRLD's who was murdered on June 18, 2018. This also accounted to his life after his death. The song is dedicated to Lil Peep, who died from a drug overdose in November 2017, and XXXTentacion, who was murdered a day before Too Soon..'s release. After Juice WRLD died from a drug overdose on December 8th 2019 at age 21, the song gained further notoriety due to the lyric, "What's the 27 Club? / We ain't making it past 21." The song initially peaked at 65 in 2018. However, following Juice WRLD's death, the song reentered the chart and peaked at 29 on the US Hot 100 Billboard charts on December 20, 2019, the days following his death. "Legends", alongside "Rich and Blind", the other song on the two-track EP they came from, were later added to Juice WRLD's second posthumous album Fighting Demons on March 18, 2022, alongside the newly released song "Sometimes".[citation needed] Mojica, Nick (20 June 2018).
