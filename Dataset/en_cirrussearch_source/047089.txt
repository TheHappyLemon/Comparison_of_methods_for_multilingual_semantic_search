Cottoidei is a suborder of ray-finned fishes which, according to the 5th edition of Fishes of the World, is placed within the order Scorpaeniformes, alongside the scorpionfishes, flatheads, eelpouts, sticklebacks and related fishes. Cottoidei was first proposed as a taxonomic grouping in 1835 by the Swiss-American zoologist Louis Agassiz. The 5th edition of Fishes of the World classifies the Cottoidei as a suborder of the order Scorpaeniformes. Other workers have found that if the Scorpaeniformes, as delimited in Fishes of the World, is not included in the Perciformes it renders the Perciformes paraphyletic. These workers retain the Cottoidei as a suborder within the Perciformes but include the zoarcoids and Sticklebacks and allies as the infraorders Zoarcales and Gasterosteales while reclassifying most the superfamilies of Fishes of the World as infraorders. The Cottoidei is divided into the following superfamilies and families: Superfamily Anoplopomatoidea Quast, 1965 Family Anoplopomatidae Jordan & Gilbert, 1883 (Sablefishes) Superfamily Zaniolepidoidea Shinohara, 1994 Family Zaniolepididae Jordan & Gilbert, 1883 (Combfishes) Superfamily Hexagrammoidea Shinohara, 1994 Family Hexagrammidae Jordan, 1888 (Greenlings) Superfamily Trichodontoidea Nazarkin & Voskoboinikova, 2000 Family Trichodontidae Bleeker, 1859 (Sandfishes) Superfamily Cottoidea Gill, 1889 Family Jordaniidae Jordan & Evermann, 1898 (Longfin sculpins) Family Rhamphocottidae Jordan & Gilbert, 1883 (Grunt sculpins) Family Scorpaenichthyidae Jordan & Evermann, 1898 Family Agonidae Swainson, 1839 (Poachers and sea ravens) Family Cottidae Bonaparte, 1831 (Sculpins) Family Psychrolutidae Günther, 1861 (Bighead sculpins) Family Bathylutichthyidae Balushkin & Voskoboinikova, 1990 (Antarctic sculpins) Superfamily Cyclopteroidea Gill, 1873 Family Cyclopteridae Bonaparte, 1831 (lumpfishes or lumpsuckers) Family Liparidae Gill, 1861 (Snailfishes) "†suborder Cottoidei Agassiz 1835".
