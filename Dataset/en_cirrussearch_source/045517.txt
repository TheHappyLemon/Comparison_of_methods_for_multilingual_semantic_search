He is currently playing with HC Dynamo Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Kablukov was selected by the Vancouver Canucks in the 5th round (146th overall) of the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. Kablukov was playing with Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod in the Kontinental Hockey League before signing on 21 July 2009 with league rival HC Spartak Moscow.

He was then traded just two days later by Metallurg to Avangard Omsk in exchange for Taylor Beck. On 29 May 2022, Kablukov signed a one-year contract with his seventh KHL club, Dynamo Moscow, for the 2022–23 season.
