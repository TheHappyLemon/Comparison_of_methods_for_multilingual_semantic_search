The 1988–89 European Cup was the 34th season of the European Cup football club tournament. The competition was won for the first time since 1969, and third time overall, by Milan comfortably in the final against former winners Steaua București. As the defending champions, PSV Eindhoven received a bye to the second round, but were eliminated by Real Madrid in the quarter-finals. English clubs were still banned, following the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985, so Liverpool were denied a place in the competition. As defending champions, and due to the ban on English clubs in UEFA competition after the Heysel Stadium disaster reducing the number of teams in the competition, PSV Eindhoven were given a bye to the second round. 6 September 1988 20:00 Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion, East Berlin Attendance: 24,000 Referee: Marcel Van Langenhove (Belgium) 6 September 1988 18:30 Laugardalsvöllur, Reykjavík Attendance: 5,000 Referee: Thorbjørn Aas (Norway) 7 September 1988 22:30 Estádio das Antas, Porto Attendance: 45,000 Referee: Roger Philippi (Luxembourg) 7 September 1988 17:30 Stadion Zabrze, Zabrze Attendance: 13,120 Referee: Vadim Zhuk (Soviet Union) 7 September 1988 21:00 Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Madrid Attendance: 66,250 Referee: Charles Scerri (Malta) 7 September 1988 19:00 Bozsik József Stadion, Budapest Attendance: 8,000 Referee: Ignace van Swieten (Netherlands) 7 September 1988 19:30 Vasil Levski National Stadium, Sofia Attendance: 30,000 Referee: Gerasimos Germanakos (Greece) 7 September 1988 20:30 Oriel Park, Dundalk Attendance: 3,206 Referee: Jim McCluskey (Scotland) 7 September 1988 16:45 National Stadium, Ta' Qali, Attard Attendance: 5,250 Referee: Dragiša Komadinić (Yugoslavia) 7 September 1988 16:00 GSZ Stadium, Larnaca Attendance: 5,500 Referee: Borislav Aleksandrov (Bulgaria) 7 September 1988 17:00 Stadion Letná, Prague Attendance: 22,296 Referee: Carlos Silva Valente (Portugal) 7 September 1988 17:00 Central Dynamo Stadium, Moscow Attendance: 33,000 Referee: İhsan Türe (Turkey) 7 September 1988 20:00 Olympiastadion, Bruges Attendance: 19,667 Referee: Antal Hutak (Hungary) 7 September 1988 16:00 Alcazar Stadium, Larissa Attendance: 9,717 Referee: Karl-Josef Assenmacher (West Germany) 7 September 1988 19:30 Gerhard-Hanappi-Stadion, Vienna Attendance: 14,500 Referee: Emilio Soriano Aladrén (Spain) 4 October 1988 Stade Louis II, Monaco Attendance: 6,383 Referee: Jean-Pierre Schön (Luxembourg) Monaco won 2–1 on aggregate. 5 October 1988 Olympiastadion, Helsinki Attendance: 6,243 Referee: Jozef Marko (Czechoslovakia) Porto won 3–2 on aggregate. 5 October 1988 Stade de la Frontière, Esch-sur-Alzette Attendance: 960 Referee: Eysteinn Guðmundsson (Iceland) Górnik Zabrze won 7–1 on aggregate. 5 October 1988 Melløs Stadion, Moss Attendance: 5,415 Referee: Eero Aho (Finland) Real Madrid won 4–0 on aggregate. 5 October 1988 Celtic Park, Glasgow Attendance: 42,763 Referee: Erik Fredriksson (Sweden) Celtic won 4–1 on aggregate. 5 October 1988 Marakana, Belgrade Attendance: 10,816 Referee: Sadık Deda (Turkey) Red Star Belgrade won 8–0 on aggregate. 5 October 1988 Qemal Stafa Stadium, Tirana Attendance: 19,250 Referee: Ștefan Petrescu (Romania) 17 Nëntori won 3–2 on aggregate. 5 October 1988 Ullevi, Gothenburg Attendance: 6,442 Referee: Janusz Eksztajn (Poland) IFK Göteborg won 7–2 on aggregate. 5 October 1988 Stadionul Steaua, Bucharest Attendance: 25,000 Referee: Dieter Pauly (West Germany) Steaua București won 7–3 on aggregate. 5 October 1988 The Oval, Belfast Attendance: 7,000 Referee: Oli Olsen (Iceland) Spartak Moscow won 3–1 on aggregate. 5 October 1988 Brøndby Stadion, Brøndbyvester Attendance: 14,105 Referee: Alan Snoddy (Northern Ireland) 2–2 on aggregate; Club Brugge won on away goals. 5 October 1988 Stade de la Maladière, Neuchâtel Attendance: 12,200 Referee: Rosario Lo Bello (Italy) 3–3 on aggregate; Neuchâtel Xamax won on penalties. 5 October 1988 Ali Sami Yen Stadium, Istanbul Attendance: 37,500 Referee: George Courtney (England) Galatasaray won 3–2 on aggregate. 6 October 1988 San Siro, Milan Attendance: 53,086 Referee: Joe Worrall (England) Milan won 7–2 on aggregate. 11 October 1988 Weserstadion, Bremen Attendance: 23,542 Referee: Joël Quiniou (France) Werder Bremen won 5–3 on aggregate. 1 The second leg in Belgrade was replayed.
