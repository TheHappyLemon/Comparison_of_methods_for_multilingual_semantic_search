Judith Arndt (born 23 July 1976) is a retired German professional cyclist, who last rode for the GreenEDGE-AIS cycling team. She won the bronze medal in the 3000 m pursuit event at the 1996 Summer Olympics when she was 20. In 2004, she won the world road race championship and came second in the Olympic road race. Arndt won the national individual pursuit championship four times and Olympic bronze in the same competition. But a viral infection during the 2000 Summer Olympics – causing a disappointing outcome  – marked the turning in her career. In two years, she finished third in the Grande Boucle (sometimes referred to as the "women's Tour de France)" in 2003, won the Tour de l'Aude twice (2002 and 2003), and added a silver medal in the road time trial at the 2003 world championship in Hamilton, Ontario. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece she won silver in the road race, and, two weeks later, became world road champion at Verona, Italy. She finished first in the UCI world ranking. In 2005, she won the national road championship for the sixth time. Arndt was appointed as a member of the inaugural UCI Athletes' Commission in 2011. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Great Britain she competed in the Women's road race and won silver in the time trial. She also competed on the track in the Women's team pursuit for the national team. Arndt ended her career after taking gold in the time trial event of the 2012 World Championships.
