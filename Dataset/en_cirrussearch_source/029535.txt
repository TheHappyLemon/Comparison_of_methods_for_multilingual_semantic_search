Marc Madiot (born 16 April 1959) is a French former professional road racing cyclist and double winner of Paris–Roubaix. He also competed in the individual road race event at the 1980 Summer Olympics. Retired from racing in 1994, he is now best known as the directeur sportif of Groupama–FDJ, a UCI WorldTeam. He is also known as the president of the French Ligue National de Cyclisme (LNC). In 1987, he made disparaging remarks about the sport of women's cycling, calling it ugly and unesthetic. In 2008, he was made a knight of the French Legion of Honor. It was presented by president Nicolas Sarkozy at the Elysée palace in Paris. He is the older brother of fellow retired racing cyclist and French national road racing champion Yvon Madiot. 1979 1st Overall Boucles de la Mayenne 1st Stage 2 1st Paris–Roubaix Espoirs 2nd Manche Atlantique 1980 1st Troyes–Dijon Sealink International 1st Stages 1 & 2 9th Olympic Games, Road Race 1981 1st Overall Tour du Limousin 1st Stage 1 2nd Overall Tour du Tarn 2nd Overall Route du Sud 3rd Overall Tour de Picardie 3rd Tour de Vendée 3rd Overall Paris–Bourges 4th Grand Prix de Mauléon-Moulins 8th Overall Four Days of Dunkirk 10th GP Ouest France 10th Overall Étoile de Bessèges 1982 1st National Cyclo-cross Championships 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Giro d'Italia 2nd Overall Tour du Limousin 2nd Overall Paris–Bourges 2nd Boucles de l'Aulne 3rd Omloop der Vlaamse Ardennen Ichtegem 3rd Côte Normande 10th GP de la Ville de Rennes 1983 1st Polynormande 1st Saint-Martin de Landelles 2nd GP Ouest France 2nd Overall Paris–Bourges 3rd Overall Étoile des Espoirs 3rd National Cyclo-cross Championships 3rd Overall Giro di Sardegna 1st Stage 4 4th Overall Tour du Vaucluse 5th Paris–Roubaix 8th Overall Tour de France 9th Overall Tour du Limousin 1984 1st Stages 2 & 3 (TTT) Tour de France 1st Trophée des Grimpeurs 1st Flèche Finistérienne 1st Boucles de l'Aulne 1st Stage 5 Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Circuit de l'Aulne/GP Le Télégramme à Châteaulin 1st Stage 3 Tour de l'Aude 2nd Overall Tour du Limousin 3rd National Cyclo-cross Championships 4th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 6th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 10th Milan–San Remo 1985 1st Paris–Roubaix 1st Grand Prix de Mauléon-Moulins 1st Grand Prix de Plumelec-Morbihan 1st Stage 2 Paris–Nice 1st Grand Prix de Wallonie 1st Chateau-Chinon 2nd National Cyclo-cross Championships 2nd Boucles de l'Aulne 2nd Grand Prix Cerami 3rd GP Ouest France 3rd Polynormande 4th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 6th Paris–Camembert 8th Overall Tour de l'Aude 1986 2nd Tour du Haut Var 1987 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st Overall Tour de l'Avenir 1st Polynormande 2nd National Cyclo-cross Championships 3rd Giro di Lombardia 3rd Overall Grand Prix du Midi Libre 5th Grand Prix des Nations 7th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 1988 2nd Road race, National Road Championships 5th Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme 7th Grand Prix des Amériques 9th Overall Tour de Romandie 1989 3rd Overall Paris–Nice 3rd GP de la Ville de Rennes 5th La Flèche Wallonne 6th Paris–Roubaix 6th Overall Grand Prix du Midi Libre 7th Overall Critérium International 1st Stage 1 7th Amstel Gold Race 8th Züri-Metzgete 8th Grand Prix des Amériques 9th Paris–Camembert 1990 1st Dijon, Cyclo-cross 7th Giro dell'Emilia 1991 1st Paris–Roubaix 6th Tour of Flanders 7th Wincanton Classic 7th Rund um den Henninger Turm 9th GP Ouest France 10th Grand Prix des Amériques 1992 1st Trophée des Grimpeurs 6th Züri-Metzgete 6th Paris–Camembert 7th Overall Four Days of Dunkirk 1st Stage 4b 7th Tour of Flanders 8th GP Ouest France 1993 2nd Bordeaux–Caudéran Clarke, Stuart (5 November 2015).
