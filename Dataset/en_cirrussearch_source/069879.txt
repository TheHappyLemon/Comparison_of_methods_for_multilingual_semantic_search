In October 2020 it was reported that Netflix had greenlit production of the series, with creators Green and Noizumi acting as writers, executive producers and showrunners, with 2D/3D-hybrid animation by French studio Blue Spirit.

Episodes 1-7 have an aspect ratio of 16:9, with episode 8 changing to a more cinematic 2.35:1. On December 11, 2023, the series was renewed for a second season.
