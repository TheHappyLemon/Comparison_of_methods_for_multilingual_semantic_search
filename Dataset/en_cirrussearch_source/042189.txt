The WTA rankings are the ratings defined by the Women's Tennis Association, introduced in November 1975. The computer that calculates the ranking is nicknamed "Medusa". Iga Swiatek is the current world No. 1 in women's singles. The WTA rankings are based on a rolling 52-week, cumulative system. A player's ranking is determined by her results at a maximum of 18 tournaments for singles and 11 for doubles. Points are awarded based on how far a player advances in a tournament. The basis for calculating a player's ranking are those tournaments that yield the highest ranking points during the rolling 52-week period. The period must include: the four Grand Slams six WTA 1000 Mandatory combined/virtually combined tournaments one WTA 1000 Mandatory (WTA-only) tournament the best of seven results from all WTA 1000 Mandatory, WTA 500, WTA 250, and WTA 125 Tournaments and ITF W15+ events the WTA Finals as a bonus tournament if the player attended Up until 2016, the WTA also distributed ranking points, for singles players only, who competed at the Summer Olympics. However, this has since been discontinued. In order to appear on the WTA rankings, players must earn ranking points in at least three tournaments, or a minimum of 10 singles ranking points or 10 doubles ranking points in one or more tournaments. The points distribution for tournaments in 2024 is shown below. Points earned in 2023 and before were different and retained their values until they expired after 52 weeks except for 2013 points. S = singles players, D = doubles teams, Q = qualification players. * Assumes undefeated round robin match record. Note that if a player or team receives one or more byes and then loses their first match of the tournament, they will only receive points for the first round of that tournament. For example, if a player receives a bye in R64 and then loses her match in R32, she will only receive points for R64 despite having advanced (via bye) to R32. Similarly, if a player or team withdraws from their first match after receiving a bye, they will not be awarded any points for that tournament. In ITF tournaments, the main draw is normally 32 for singles and 16 for doubles. Losers in the first round of doubles will receive points equal to that shown in the R32 column above. For subsequent rounds (quarter-finals onwards) the points are the same as for singles. as of 18 March 2024[update] 2023 points and 2024 points are different due to change in the ranking system. Points from WTA 125 and ITF tournaments are not shown. Points in brackets () don't count to total points by reason of tournament limit.
