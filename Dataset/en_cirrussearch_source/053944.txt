She was mainly a baseline player who possessed a solid backhand and forehand and who had good accuracy in her shots. She married architect Robert D. Farquhar in New York City, in 1903. They had three children: David Farquhar (1904 – ), John Percival Farquhar (1912 – 2013) and Colin Farquhar (1913 – ).
