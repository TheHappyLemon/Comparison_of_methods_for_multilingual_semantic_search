Alex Meret Cavaliere OMRI (Italian pronunciation: [ˈaːleks meˈrɛt]; born 22 March 1997) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Serie A club Napoli and the Italy national team. Born in Udine, Meret began his career at an early age with amateur club Donatello Calcio before making a switch to the famous Udinese youth system in 2012. After rising through the academy system at the club, he made his senior debut in 2015. He later had spells on loan with SPAL, whom he helped win the Serie B title in 2017, and achieve promotion to Serie A. He joined Napoli in 2018, winning a league title in 2023. At international level, Meret has represented Italy at U16, U17, U18, U19 and U21 levels, and made his senior debut for Italy in 2019, also representing the nation at their victorious UEFA Euro 2020 campaign. An Udinese youth product, Meret was promoted to the first team as second-choice goalkeeper behind Orestis Karnezis during the 2015–16 season. He made his senior professional debut on 2 December 2015 in the Coppa Italia against Atalanta. In July 2016, Meret was sent on loan to Serie B club SPAL. He returned to SPAL on loan for the 2017–18 season. On 5 July 2018, Meret signed with Napoli until 30 June 2023. The transfer fee agreed with Udinese was reported as €35 million. He made his European debut on 14 February 2019, in a 3–1 away win over FC Zürich in the first leg of the round of 32 of the Europa League. During his first two seasons with Napoli, he was frequently used in a rotational role alongside David Ospina. However, under the club's new manager Gennaro Gattuso, he found himself relegated to the bench until the season break due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The coach favoured the Colombian shot-stopper due to his superior ability with the ball at his feet. Following a suspension to Ospina, Meret started in the 2020 Coppa Italia Final against Juventus on 17 June. After a goalless draw in regulation time, Meret saved Paulo Dybala's spot kick, contributing to his team's 4–2 penalty shoot-out victory. Subsequently, Meret found himself back in rotation with Ospina, starting about half of the matches until the end of the season. This rotational role continued into the following 2020–21 season, with Ospina and Meret alternating every other match in the Europa League, Serie A, and Coppa Italia. However, in the next season, Meret assumed the role as the second goalkeeper in the league for the majority of the season under the new coach Luciano Spalletti. He was the first-choice keeper in the UEFA Europa League and the Coppa Italia. In the subsequent 2022–23 season, Meret regained the role as the starting goalkeeper for Napoli after Ospina departed the club. He played the majority of the games in Serie A and the Champions League, playing a crucial role in winning the first scudetto in 33 years and reaching the quarterfinals of the Champions League. Meret was a crucial member in the Italy U19 national team which took part in the 2016 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, finishing as runner-up after losing in the final; he was named in the team of the tournament alongside Kylian Mbappé of France. In March 2017, following impressive performances for SPAL in Serie B, he was called up to the Italy national team squad for the World Cup qualification for a match against Albania and a friendly against the Netherlands. On 22 March 2018, he made his debut with the Italy U21, playing as starter in a friendly match against Norway. He took part in the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship under manager Luigi Di Biagio, as the team's first-choice goalkeeper. Meret made his international debut for the senior national team under manager Roberto Mancini, on 18 November 2019, coming on as a substitute for Salvatore Sirigu in a 9–1 home win over Armenia, in Italy's final Euro 2020 qualifier. In June 2021, he was included in Italy's squad for UEFA Euro 2020. On 11 July, Meret won the European Championship with Italy following a 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory over England at Wembley Stadium in the final, after a 1–1 draw in extra-time. He was the only squad member not to make an appearance in the competition. Considered once to be a talented and highly promising young goalkeeper in the Italian media, Meret is an agile goalkeeper, who possesses good reactions and shot-stopping abilities, despite his height and imposing physique, and who is known for his handling and ability to rush off his line. He has also drawn praise in the media for his decision–making, maturity, and calm composure under pressure, as well as his discipline and work ethic, despite his youth; moreover, he is capable of organising his defence effectively and is known for his penalty–stopping abilities. Although he is competent with his feet, his distribution has been cited as an area in need of improvement. He has also struggled with physical problems and injuries throughout his career.
