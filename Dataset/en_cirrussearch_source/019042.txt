The first written mention of Horní Benešov is from 1226, when it was a mining settlement. The silver mines were one of the oldest in Czech lands. The town of Benešov was founded on the site of the settlement in 1253, and the town rights were confirmed in 1271 by King Ottokar II. The town was destroyed by a Hungarian invasion in 1474 and then during the Thirty Years' War. The mining was in decline since 17th century. During the 19th and 20th centuries, economic development of Benešov was driven mostly by textile industry.

Before World War I, the town was part of the Austrian Silesia region. After World War I, the town was within the state of Czechoslovakia and in 1926 was given its present name. From 1938 to 1945 Horní Benešov was annexed by Nazi Germany and administered as a part of Reichsgau Sudetenland. After the war, the German population was expelled. In 1902–1914 and in 1951–1992, baryte was mined here. The Church of Saint Catherine was built in the Neoclassical style in 1719. It has preserved elements from the original building from the 16th century. Horní Benešov is twinned with: Pszów, Poland "Population of Municipalities – 1 January 2023".
