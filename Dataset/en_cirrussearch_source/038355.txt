KazSat-1 (Kazakh: ҚазСат-1, QazSat-1) is the first Kazakh communications satellite. It was launched on 17 June 2006, at 22:44:05 UTC by Proton-K / Blok DM-2M launch vehicle.] This satellite was constructed by Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center for the satellite bus and Thales Alenia Space (Italy) for the payload. Thales Alenia Space is also the provider of KazSat-2 and KazSat-3 payloads. The contract for the manufacture and launch of the first Kazakhstani geostationary spacecraft was signed in January 2004. Twelwe Ku-band transponders (each 72 MHz), KazSat-1 was a communications satellite planned to occupy a geosynchronous orbit approximately 36,000 km (22,000 mi) above the Earth. It was produced by Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center in cooperation with Thales Alenia Space (Italy). The cost of Kazakhstan for the production of the first satellite amounted to US$65 million. Partial control of the satellite was lost in July 2008 and completely in October 2008. It was supposed to serve for 10 years, but already on 26 November 2008, due to a failure in the on-board digital system, it stopped responding to control signals. The failure was declared irreversible, and in August 2009, the satellite was transferred to a burial orbit.
