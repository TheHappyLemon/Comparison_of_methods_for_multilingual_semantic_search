Aboa (from the Latin name of Turku) is a seasonal Finnish research station in Antarctica, located in Queen Maud Land, about 130 kilometres (81 mi) from the coast, on a nunatak called Basen in the Kraul Mountains. Opened in 1988, the station was designed and built by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, and funded by the Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry (now part of the Finnish Ministry of Employment and the Economy). The station is used in the Antarctic summer only. Currently the station has living and work space for expeditions of 15 people, and allows temporary living space for up to 17 people. The Swedish station Wasa is located only 200 metres (660 ft) away. Together, Aboa and Wasa form the Nordenskiöld Base and the two stations work in close cooperation.
