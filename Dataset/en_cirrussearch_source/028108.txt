The first written mention of Fryšták is from 15 January 1356 under its Latin name Freystat. In 1382, Fryšták was described as a prosperous town with trade, crafts, a slaughterhouse and a spa. The prosperity was interrupted by the Thirty Years' War. By the 19th century, Fryšták was notable for agriculture and wood production. The fire of 1841 caused Fryšták's traditional wooden buildings to be replaced by more modern buildings. By the latter 20th century a contemporary wave of building with construction of many new houses included the installation of modern infrastructure such as natural gas lines and telephone networks. There are no railways or major roads passing through the town. The landmark of the town is the Church of Saint Nicholas. The building is not architecturally clean, it can best be described as a baroque building. The original part of the church is from the 16th century, in 1820 the building was extended and the bell tower was replaced by a new one. The baroque stone cross in front of the church is from 1763. The first stone town hall was built in Fryšták in 1680. The old building was replaced by a new one in 1900.
