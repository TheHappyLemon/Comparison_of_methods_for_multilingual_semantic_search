Hrivík won the President's Cup in 2009–10 with the Moncton Wildcats of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. On May 30, 2012, Hrivík signed his first NHL contract on a three-year entry-level contract with the New York Rangers. He made his NHL debut for the Rangers in a game against the Detroit Red Wings on February 21, 2016. On July 1, 2017, after five full seasons within the Rangers organization, Hrivík left as a free agent and was signed to a one-year, two-way contract with the Calgary Flames. In the 2017–18 season, he was first assigned to AHL affiliate, the Stockton Heat. Having suffered through injury, Hrivík responded to produce 30 points in 32 games. He was later recalled to appear in 3 scoreless games with the Flames. Opting to leave the Flames in the off-season, Hrivík continued his career abroad, agreeing to a one-year deal with Russian club HC Vityaz of the KHL on July 1, 2018. In the 2018–19 season, Hrivík added eight goals and 15 points in 26 games with Vityaz before his season was cut short due to injury. As a free agent, Hrivík left the KHL and agreed to a one-year deal with the newly promoted Swedish club, Leksands IF of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL), on 16 August 2019. Hrivík remained with Leksands for the 2020–21 season, increasing his scoring output to lead the team and the league in scoring with 37 assists and 51 points in just 44 regular season games. He was selected as the SHL's forward of the year and was awarded the Guldhjälmen as the SHL's most valuable player. On 1 May 2021, Hrivík opted to leave the SHL and return to the KHL, signing a one-year contract with Russian outfit Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod.
