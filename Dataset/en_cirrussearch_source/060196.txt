The silver medalist, Nikita Tregubov, qualified for the Olympics but was not allowed to take a flight to China due to a positive COVID-19 test and had to miss the Olympics. The bronze medalist, Dom Parsons, retired from competitions. Grotheer was the 2021 World champion. Alexander Tretyakov, who was also the 2014 Olympic champion, and Alexander Gassner were the silver and bronze medalists, respectively.
