I want to create anthems for big moments in their lives...I don't want my music to play for a few months and then go away forever.

Mendes has been open about his struggles with anxiety, which he disclosed publicly in his song "In My Blood". He said, "I spoke to a therapist a couple of times. [...] Therapy is what works for you. Therapy is listening to music and running on the treadmill, therapy is going to dinner with your friends—it's something that distracts you, that helps you heal and so it just depends on what you think therapy is. I made a conscious effort to be more connected to the people in my life. I found I was closing myself off from everybody, thinking that would help me battle it then realizing the only way I was going to battle it was completely opening up and letting people in."
