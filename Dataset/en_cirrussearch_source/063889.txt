The Löwen Frankfurt (English: Frankfurt Lions) are a professional ice hockey team based in Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany. They currently play in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. The club is the successor of the Frankfurt Lions, formed in 1991, which experienced its greatest success in 2004 when it won the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. When the Lions folded in 2010 after having had their licence revoked by the DEL a new club was formed, the Löwen Frankfurt, which began play in the lower divisions of German ice hockey. The new club won promotion to the second-tier DEL2 in 2014, and to the DEL itself in 2022. The Löwen play in the ice rink on Ratsweg. This was opened in 1981 and was long considered one of the most modern halls of its kind in Germany. It consists of 7,000 spectator spots, of which approximately 3,500 are seated and 3,500 standing. Löwen Frankfurt have 36 registered fan clubs. The team's home arena is called Eissporthalle Frankfurt (Eissporthalle am Ratsweg), which holds 6,946 spectators. The arena has been home to Löwen Frankfurt (and earlier to the Frankfurt Lions) since 1991.
