This is the order of battle for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It should not be considered completely up to date nor accurate, being based on open-source press reporting. An updated order of battle estimate for April 23, 2023, by the Institute for the Study of War is accessible at: Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, April 23 Senior commanders for the 2022 invasion of Ukraine Commanders of the various MOD armed services and branches do not have operational control over the forces. They are responsible for force development and generation. The Chiefs of the ground forces, the aerospace forces, the navy, the strategic missile forces and the airborne forces also hold the appointments of Deputy Ministers of Defence, junior to the Chief of the General Staff, who is the First Deputy Minister of Defence. The General Staff commands and controls forces through the National Defence Management Centre (NDMC). Operational control of the forces is carried out by the five Operational-Strategic Commands - the Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Military Districts and the OSK Northern Fleet, which is their equal. The Western and the Southern Military Districts share borders with Ukraine and are directly involved in the command and control of the operations. Pre-2022 Russian military doctrine had specified that on the outbreak of war, armed forces from non-MOD services (like Rosgvardiya) would be placed under the General Staff.  Russia (President of the Russian Federation: Supreme Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Putin) Security Council Rosgvardiya (General of the Army Viktor Zolotov;

President Vladimir Putin was repeatedly reported as taking a very involved stance, sometimes giving orders to field formations. In April 2022, the invasion began to run into setbacks; Russian forces were forced to withdraw from their attempt to take Kyiv. Therefore to handle a longer war, a single coordinating senior officer was appointed. Army General Aleksandr Dvornikov (8 April 2022 – 25 June 2022): placed in overall charge of military operations in Ukraine, effectively ending the grouping system; Colonel General Gennady Zhidko (26 June 2022 – 7 October 2022): appointed by Vladimir Putin to the top position, replacing Dvornikov; Army General Sergey Surovikin (8 October 2022 – 11 January 2023): previously commander of the Aerospace Forces and Army Group South, replacing Zhidko in overall command. From 12 January 2023 Army General Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the General Staff, was appointed as commander of military operations in Ukraine, with Surovikin as his deputy. The actual operational chain of command of the Russian military effort in Ukraine is not public, changes, and is a mix of state and non-state bodies. Personal rivalries are evident. President Vladimir Putin however remains firmly in control, sometimes micromanaging. The loose connection of various mercenary bodies and Ramzan Kadyrov's Chechens to the official command chain has been represented by placing them under headers separate to the Russian Armed Forces. Scheduling and control of tactical fighter, ground attack, and strategic bomber "sorties" (one flight of one aircraft) is unclear. On 18 April 2023, Russian official sources said that President Putin had held meetings in the Kherson area with several commanders. The President "..received reports from the commander of the Dnepr forces grouping, General Lieutenant Oleg Makarevich, the commander of the Vostok [Eastern] forces grouping, General Lieutenant Andrey Kuzmenko, and the deputy commander of the combined grouping, General Colonel Mikhail Teplinsky." The meetings likely took place before April 16.  Russia (President of the Russian Federation: Supreme Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Putin) Security Council Russian General Staff (Chief of the General Staff: General of the Army Valery Gerasimov, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff Nikolay Bogdanovsky) National Defense Management Center (Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev) Long Range Aviation - administratively Aerospace Forces; operationally, air operations centre of whatever description 22nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Division (Colonel Mykola Varpahovych) 52nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment (Tupolev Tu-22M) (Colonel Oleg Timoshyn) Wagner Group (Commander: Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Utkin †) DShRG Rusich (Commander: Alexey Milchakov) Gazpromneft Security Fakel Plamya Patriot Redut Don Brigade Potok Battalion Veterany Battalion Tsar's Wolves Uran E.N.O.T.
