The 5th Academy Awards were held by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on November 18, 1932, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California, hosted by Conrad Nagel. Films screened in Los Angeles between August 1, 1931, and July 31, 1932, were eligible to receive awards. Walt Disney created a short animated film for the banquet, Parade of the Award Nominees. Grand Hotel became the only Best Picture winner to be nominated for Best Picture and nothing else. It was the first of five films to date to win Best Picture without a Best Director nomination, followed by Driving Miss Daisy, Argo, Green Book, and CODA; and the third of seven to win without a screenwriting nomination. This was the first of three Oscars in which two films not nominated for Best Picture received more nominations than the winner (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Guardsman). This happened again at the 25th and 79th Academy Awards. This year saw the introduction of short film awards, with Best Short Subject, Cartoon winner Flowers and Trees becoming the first color film to win an Oscar. There was a tie for Best Actor, a unique event in Academy history. Fredric March had led Wallace Beery in the balloting by only one vote, and the rules (later changed) said that the leader and runner-up could both be considered winners if they were only 3 votes apart. This left the Academy short one Oscar. By winning Best Actor for The Champ, as well as starring in Grand Hotel, Wallace Beery is the only performer to date to appear in a Best Picture-winning film and win an acting Oscar for a different Best Picture nominee in the same year. This was the last ceremony to date in which no film won more than two Oscars. Nominees were announced on October 12, 1932. Winners are listed first and highlighted in boldface.
