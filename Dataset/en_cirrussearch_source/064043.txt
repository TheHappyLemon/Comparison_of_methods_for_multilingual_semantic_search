Maze Runner: The Death Cure (also known simply as The Death Cure) is a 2018 American dystopian science fiction film directed by Wes Ball and with a screenplay by T.S. Nowlin, based on the 2011 novel The Death Cure written by James Dashner. It is the sequel to the 2015 film Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials and the third and final installment in the Maze Runner film series. Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Patricia Clarkson, Ki Hong Lee, Dexter Darden, Alexander Flores, Giancarlo Esposito, Aidan Gillen, Barry Pepper, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jacob Lofland, Katherine McNamara, Rosa Salazar and Will Poulter reprise their roles from the previous films with Walton Goggins joining the cast. Maze Runner: The Death Cure was originally set to be released on February 17, 2017, in the United States by 20th Century Fox, but the studio rescheduled the film's release for January 26, 2018, allowing time for O'Brien to recover from injuries he sustained during filming. The film received mixed reviews from critics with praise for the cast performances, action sequences and visual effects but criticism for the storyline and character development. The film grossed over $288 million worldwide. Thomas, Newt, and Frypan, the last of the free "Gladers", join with the Right Arm resistance to retrieve other Immunes from a carriage of a train operated by WCKD, the organization responsible for capturing and experimenting on immune children. They discover that Minho, their Glader friend whom WCKD had captured, was on a different carriage and is headed to the "Last City", WCKD's base of operations. Against the orders of Vince, the leader of the Right Arm, the three head to the Last City to rescue Minho, who is being tortured by WCKD along with several other children in the hope of developing a cure for the virus. The group is attacked by Cranks, humans infected with the Flare. However, they are saved by Jorge and Brenda, who join them. The group makes it to the wall of the Last City, which is heavily fortified. Outside the wall, people are rallying in protest to be let into the city. When WCKD opens fire at the protesters, the group is captured and taken to a hideout by a crew wearing gas masks. One of the members is revealed to be Gally, who survived being impaled with a spear by Minho. Gally takes them to meet Lawrence, a rebellion leader, who helps Thomas, Newt, and Gally enter the Last City. Gally takes Thomas and Newt on a tour of the city and, after spotting Teresa, tells Thomas that he can get them into WCKD headquarters. Newt then reveals to Thomas that he is infected. Promising to cure him, Thomas and Gally capture Teresa. Disguised as WCKD soldiers, Thomas, Newt, and Gally escort Teresa inside WCKD headquarters and toward the location of the Immunes. Gally looks after the Immune children and stays to find a serum that slows the Flare. Thomas, Teresa, and Newt go to find Minho, but are discovered and chased by Janson. Teresa lets them escape to find Minho before going to do a blood test on Thomas' blood, obtained when she was removing trackers from the Gladers. After delivering the Immune children and the serum to Brenda, Gally returns to WCKD headquarters to find Thomas. Brenda is forced to flee with the Immune children to avoid capture. Thomas and Newt reunite with Minho and escape from the WCKD building. Teresa discovers that Thomas' blood can cure the Flare. She shares her discovery with WCKD's leader, Ava Paige, both of whom agree that they must find Thomas. Brenda and the Immune children escape WCKD with Frypan's help. Meanwhile, Lawrence rallies his rebels outside the city before blowing a hole in the city wall and sacrificing himself to allow his allies and the infected people to storm the city. Gally saves Thomas, Newt, and Minho from WCKD soldiers. While Minho and Gally go to get the serum from Brenda, Thomas gets a pendant from Newt before Newt passes out. Teresa transmits her voice throughout the city and tells Thomas that his blood can save Newt if he will return to WCKD. Newt, nearly consumed by the Flare, regains consciousness and attacks and begs Thomas to kill him. When Thomas refuses, Newt fatally stabs himself with his own knife. Thomas returns to the WCKD facility and confronts Paige. While she talks with him, Janson, having caught the Flare, kills her and uses a sedative on Thomas. Thomas wakes up inside the facility. Teresa successfully removes some of his blood. She hears that Janson is interested only in curing himself and others whom he deems worthy. Teresa attacks Janson and frees Thomas, who fights with Janson. Thomas releases two Cranks on Janson, killing him. With the building on fire, Thomas and Teresa escape to the roof. The rest of the team arrives on a Berg. Teresa helps Thomas on board, but the building caves in, causing Teresa to fall to her death. The group escapes with the rest of the Immunes to a safe haven, where the remaining population can live in safety and rebuild civilization. Thomas discovers that the pendant that Newt gave him had a note in it. He reads the note in which Newt tells him to look after everyone before he thanks Thomas for being his friend.

According to the Directors Guild of Canada's production list, the film was scheduled to resume filming on May 9, and complete principal photography on July 26. However, on April 29, 2016, production was shut down indefinitely as O'Brien's injuries were revealed to be more serious than previously thought. Filming resumed on March 6, 2017, in Cape Town, South Africa.[non-primary source needed] In May 2017, it was announced that Walton Goggins would play the part of Lawrence, described as "an unusual and dangerous character who is part-revolutionary, part-anarchist, and a voice for the voiceless people." Principal photography wrapped on June 3, 2017.[non-primary source needed] The visual effects were provided by Weta Digital and supervised by Chris White. The Death Cure was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on February 17, 2017.

On April 22, 2017, the studio delayed the release date once again, to February 9, 2018, in order to allow more time for post-production; months later, on August 25, the studio moved the release forward two weeks.[non-primary source needed] The film premiered on January 26, 2018.
