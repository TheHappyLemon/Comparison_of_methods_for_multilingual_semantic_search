Extended Play is an EP by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released in 2013. Released as a digital download by the band themselves and without a record company, it was the band's first new music in ten years since their 2003 album Say You Will and the last release of studio material to feature Lindsey Buckingham before his removal from the band in 2018. At the beginning of 2010, the trio of Lindsey Buckingham, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood went to Hawaii to record eight new songs. Stevie Nicks was in bereavement following the death of her mother and did not attend these sessions. Later that year, Nicks spent four days in the studio to record vocals on two songs, one selected by Nicks and the other picked by Buckingham. Nicks also dusted off a demo from the Buckingham Nicks sessions and re-recorded it with the rest of Fleetwood Mac. In a 2012 interview with Rolling Stone, Nicks considered releasing one new song in January of 2013 and another in February 2013, although Buckingham hoped that the band would instead release their new material in the form of an EP. While the EP was only available digitally without any promotion and no physical CD version was ever released, "Extended Play" still reached No. 48 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and sold 9,000 copies in its first week. However, the next week, it left the chart entirely. It also charted at No. 14 on the Top Digital Albums chart, No. 9 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and No. 13 on the Top Rock Albums chart. "Without You" was a "lost" demo written during the Buckingham Nicks era, which Nicks herself had found posted on YouTube. "Sad Angel" and "Without You" were performed on their 2013 tour.
