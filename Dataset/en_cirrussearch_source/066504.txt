The Tajikistan national association football team represents Tajikistan in association football and is controlled by the Tajikistan Football Federation. Tajikistan played its first official game on 11 April 1994 in Tashkent as part of a regional tournament. It lost that game against Kazakhstan 0–1. The first official competition the team entered was the qualifiers for the 1996 AFC Asian Cup, when it was seeded in the 3-team Group 8 with Uzbekistan and Bahrain. Bahrain later withdrew, leaving Tajikistan to a play-off against their Middle Asian neighbors. Tajikistan won the first game 4–0, and were beaten in the away game 0–5 after extra time. It did not enter a World Cup qualifying tournament until the 1998 FIFA World Cup edition, recording 4 victories in its preliminary group stage including a 5–0 triumph over Turkmenistan, and losing only to China, which placed it second behind its eastern neighbors, and out of the tournament. Following Tajikistan's 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, coach Mubin Ergashev and his staff were relieved of their duties. Tajikistan were drawn into a 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification group with the Philippines, Yemen and Nepal. Following defeat to the Philippines on 27 March 2018, confirming Tajikistan's failure to qualify for the Asian Cup, manager Khakim Fuzailov resigned. After failing to have a direct spot for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, Tajikistan hired Croatian manager Petar Šegrt, and Tajikistan took part in the third round of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification, joining with Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, and Singapore. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the third round was played in a single round-robin group format with a centralised host, which Tajikistan's group saw its neighbour Kyrgyzstan hosting it. Tajikistan defeated Myanmar (4–0) and Singapore (1–0), before holding neighbour Kyrgyzstan to a goalless draw, topping the group and, after failing in 5 previous attempts, Tajikistan was able to qualify to its first-ever AFC Asian Cup in 2023. Tajikistan was invited to the 2022 King's Cup in Thailand held in September 2022 where Tajikistan defeated Trinidad and Tobago 2–1 and sees them advanced to the final defeating Malaysia in the penalty shootout winning their second international trophy. In the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, Tajikistan reached the quarter-finals for the first time in their history after losing 1-0 to the eventual runner-up Jordan due to a 66th minute own goal from Vahdat Hanonov. In September 2017, Tajikistan's kit was supplied by Chinese sporting apparel company Li-Ning.   Win   Draw   Loss   Fixture Kuwait  v  Tajikistan Tajikistan  v  Turkmenistan Oman  v  Tajikistan Uzbekistan  v  Tajikistan Singapore  v  Tajikistan Malaysia  v  Tajikistan Tajikistan  v  Jordan Pakistan  v  Tajikistan Hong Kong  v  Tajikistan China  v  Tajikistan Tajikistan  v  Qatar Tajikistan  v  Lebanon Tajikistan  v  United Arab Emirates Tajikistan  v  Jordan Saudi Arabia  v  Tajikistan Tajikistan  v  Saudi Arabia Jordan  v  Tajikistan Tajikistan  v  Pakistan As of 1 February 2022.
