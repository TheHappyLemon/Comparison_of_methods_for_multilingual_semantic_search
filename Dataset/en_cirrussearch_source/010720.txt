The LHF was awarded hosting duties for the 2006 IIHF World Championship, and Lipmans oversaw the construction of Arena Riga for the event. The 11,000-seat arena was a requirement for hosting the World Championship, and was delayed due to disagreements on the construction contract and finding an investor to fund the project. The Baltic Times reported that Lipmans was to blame for the delays, and that he was asked to resign due to a conflict of interest with owning shares in the arena's management company.
