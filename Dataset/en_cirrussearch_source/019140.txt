By the 16th century Frankfurt developed into a wealthy and busy city with an economy based on trade and financial services. In 1585 a bourse was established to set up fixed currency exchange rates, which is considered to mark the 'birth' of the stock exchange. During the following centuries Frankfurt developed into one of the world's first stock exchanges – next to Amsterdam, London and Paris. Bankers like Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Max Warburg had substantial influence on Frankfurt's financial trade. In 1879 Frankfurt Stock Exchange moved into its new building at Börsenplatz. During the final third of the 19th century, Frankfurt was a major financial center in the Atlantic world. It was only in 1949 after World War II that the Frankfurt Stock Exchange finally established as the leading stock exchange in Germany with consequently incoming national and international investments. During the 1990s the Frankfurt Stock Exchange was also bourse for the Neuer Markt (New Market) as part of the worldwide dot-com boom. In 1993 the Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (Frankfurt Stock Exchange) became Deutsche Börse AG, operating businesses for the exchange. From the early 1960s onwards the Frankfurt Stock Exchange took advantage of the close by Bundesbank which effectively decided on financial policies in Europe until the introduction of the euro in 2002. Since then the exchange profits from the presence of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. In 2002 and 2004 Deutsche Börse was in advanced negotiations to take over London Stock Exchange, which were broken off in 2005. A further merger bid was blocked by the European Commission in 2017.
