Kaucminde Manor (German: Gut Kauzminde/Kauzmünde) is a manor house, also referred to as a palace due to its design, in the historical region of Zemgale, in Latvia. The manor house was built around 1780 for Count Peter Ludwig von der Pahlen by Danish-born architect Severin Jensen. A project to attach the manor house to the adjacent buildings was completed in 1912, so the semi-circular complex is also called Kaucminde Palace.
