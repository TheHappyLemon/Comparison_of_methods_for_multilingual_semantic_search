Kurakhove (Ukrainian: Кура́хове, pronounced [kʊˈrɑxowe]; Russian: Курахово, romanized: Kurakhovo) is a city in Pokrovsk Raion of Donetsk Oblast (province) of Ukraine. Population: 18,220 (2022 estimate); 21,479 (2001). Kurakhove is home to the Kurakhove Power Station. The unrecognized 11 May 2014 Donetsk Oblast independence referendum was held in Kurakhove, but the city did not become part of the territory controlled by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (who held the referendum). Since then the city is 10.0 kilometres (6.2 mi) west of the frontlines of the Russo-Ukrainian War. As of the 2001 Ukrainian census, the town had a population of 21,516, which decreased to 18,220 in 2022. The majority of the population identifies as ethnic Ukrainian, but is vastly Russian-speaking.
