Waste of MFZB is the fifth studio album released by American punk rock band Zebrahead exclusively in Japan, it is also their final album with band member Justin Mauriello, who left the group shortly afterwards. As the title suggests, the album is made up of songs that never made the final cut of the band's previous release MFZB, except for the cover of the song "Wannabe" by Spice Girls, which was recorded during production for the band's third studio album Playmate of the Year.

"Are You for Real?" - the only single released from the album. The majority of radio airplay received from the song was in Japan, a music video accompanied its release.
