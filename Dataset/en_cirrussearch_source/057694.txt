Lokalise is a cloud-based localization and translation management system for agile teams. The company was founded in Riga, Latvia, and is a distributed company; all employees are remote workers. It has over 300 employees from over 25 countries. Lokalise was founded in 2017 by Nick Ustinov and Petr Antropov. In 2020, the company raised its first funds, reaching $6M in a series A round after bootstrapping for the 3 years following its foundation. The founders decided to raise external capital to accelerate company growth. After raising one of the largest first-time investments for a Latvian-founded startup company, Lokalise went fully remote.
