Ethan Katzberg (born April 5, 2002) is a Canadian hammer thrower and the reigning world champion in that event, winning gold in Budapest at the 2023 World Championships. He previously competed at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, winning the silver medal. Katzberg started throwing hammer at the age of 14 after watching his father coach his sister in the event, thinking it looked fun. He initially trained at the Nanaimo Track and Field Club. Following high school he moved to Kamloops to be trained by new coach Dylan Armstrong, a former Olympic shot put medallist. Armstrong said of the new talent then that he was "a skinny basketball player when I got him. What really stuck out, obviously, was his height and his speed. That’s a rare combination. It’s hard to find a fast, tall, co-ordinated guy that may have some interest in throwing — they all go to basketball, football or other sports." Making his major international tournament debut at the 2021 World Athletics U20 Championships, Katzberg qualified to the hammer throw final but finished last with no valid throws. He won a silver medal in the hammer throw event at the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Katzberg enjoyed early success on the international competitive circuit in 2023, notably winning gold when the Diamond League held a promotional mixed-gender hammer throw event at the 2023 Meeting de Paris. He won his first Canadian national title months later. Competing in his first world championships in Budapest at the 2023 World Athletics Championships, Katzberg qualified for the finals with the best throw and a national record of 81.18 m (266 ft 4 in). Katzberg threw a 81.25 m (266 ft 6+3⁄4 in) on his fifth throw, setting another new national record and winning the gold medal and world title. Katzberg's victory made him both the youngest ever men’s hammer throw medallist and world champion, and the first Canadian man to win a medal in the event. His victory ended the reign of five-time world champion Paweł Fajdek who finished fourth, while he also defeated Wojciech Nowicki, the reigning Olympic champion. Katzberg was part of a Canadian sweep of the hammer events in Budapest, along with Camryn Rogers' victory in the women's event.
