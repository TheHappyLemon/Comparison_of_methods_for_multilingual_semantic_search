Villages and hamlets of Benátky, Horní Studenec, Kohoutov, Nové Ransko, Nový Studenec, Stružinec and Údavy are administrative parts of Ždírec nad Doubravou. The name Ždírec is derived from the Old Czech word žďářit, which means "to remove the forest with fire".

The first written mention of Ždírec nad Doubravou is from 1399. It was probably founded shortly before, during the colonization of the area. For centuries, it was a small village administered as a part of the Přibyslav estate, and since 1677 as part of the Polná estate. The worst tragedy in the history of Ždírec nad Doubravou took place on 9 May 1945, when it was damaged by a Red Army raid and dozens of inhabitants were killed. In the second half of the 20th century, the village began to be expanded, and the number of inhabitants grew. In 2000, Ždírec nad Doubravou was promoted to a town.
