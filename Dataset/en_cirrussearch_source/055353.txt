Aradidae is a family of true bugs (Heteroptera). Members of the family are commonly known as flat bugs due to their dorsoventrally flattened bodies. With few exceptions, these cryptic insects are of no economic importance. This family occurs worldwide, with the most diversity occurring in Australia. Temperate species commonly live under the bark of dead trees, while many tropical species are found in leaf litter or on fallen twigs or branches. Most members of the family are thought to be mycophagous (fungus eating), but little is known of the feeding habits of most species. They can be attracted to the pheromones of bark beetles. Many of the tropical taxa are apterous. "Family Aradidae - Flat Bugs". bugguide.net. Retrieved 2022-04-07.
