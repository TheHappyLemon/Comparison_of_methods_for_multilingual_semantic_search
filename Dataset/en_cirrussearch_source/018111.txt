Linda Melanie Villumsen Serup (born 9 April 1985) is a Danish-born road racing cyclist, who last rode for UCI Women's Team Team Virtu Cycling. Villumsen became a New Zealand citizen in 2009 and has ridden under a Kiwi licence from 2010. Born in Herning, Villumsen won the European under 23 time trial championship in 2006 and 2007. She was Danish national champion in both road racing and time trialing in 2006, 2008 and 2009. In 2006, Cycling World named her their Cyclist of the Year. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing she finished 5th in the women's road race and 13th in the time trial. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London she finished 18th in the road race and fourth in the time trial, missing out on a medal by less than two seconds. Villumsen won the Route de France Féminine in 2006 and 2013. From 2008 to 2014 she placed 10th, 3rd, 3rd, 2nd, 3rd, 2nd and 9th in world championships time trials. From 2012 to 2014 she placed 7th, 6th and 8th in world championships road races. At the 2014 Commonwealth Games she won the gold medal in the road time trial and placed 5th in the road race. In September 2014 the UnitedHealthcare team announced that they had signed Villumsen for the 2015 season after two seasons with Wiggle–Honda. In September 2015 Villumsen won the individual time trial at the UCI Road World Championships in Richmond, Virginia. Afterwards, her trade team, UnitedHealthcare, almost dropped her for riding her team issue New Zealand frame instead of her normal Wilier Cento Time Trial bike. The NZ team's bike, with its altered geometry, meant she could get much lower. Villumsen is the only New Zealand senior cyclist to win an individual medal at the UCI Road World Championships. 2005 1st Alblasserdam Danish National Road Championships 2nd Road race 3rd Time trial 2nd Overall Damesronde van Drenthe 2nd New Zealand World Cup 2006 1st Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships Danish National Road Championships 1st Time trial 1st Road race 1st Overall La Route de France 1st Omloop der Kempen 1st Mountains classification Damesronde van Drenthe 2nd Overall Ster Zeeuwsche Eilanden 1st Stage 1 (ITT) 2nd L'Heure d'Or Féminine 3rd Individual pursuit, Danish National Track Championships 9th Overall Holland Ladies Tour 1st Young rider classification 2007 1st Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 1st Stage 6 Tour de l'Aude Cycliste Féminin 3rd Overall Holland Ladies Tour 5th Overall Emakumeen Bira 10th Overall Giro d'Italia Femminile 2008 Danish National Road Championships 1st Time trial 1st Road race 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Giro della Toscana Int.
