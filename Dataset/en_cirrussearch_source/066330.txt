TMK 2300 (sometimes alternatively regarded as TMK 2200-K) is a low-floor tram produced by Končar - Electric Vehicles. It began production in 2009, based on further development of its predecessor, TMK 2200, using Končar's proprietary R&D and technology. The vehicle was exhibited at 2022 InnoTrans in Berlin. One unit is 20.7 meters long, 3.4 meters high without pantograph, 2.3 meters wide and weighs 28 tonnes. It is able to reach a speed of 70 km/h, but is restricted to 50 km/h for safety reasons in an urban environment. The tram is equipped with batteries in case of a power outage, giving it an additional 500-metre distance at low speed without an external electric source. The vehicle also boasts a modern passenger notification system, video surveillance, an air conditioning system and other similar equipment. As with the previous 2200 model, the bogie is designed as to store wheels in the bearing boxes that form the basic frame. The basic frame is then stored in the chassis (bogie) frame itself, and the axle is replaced by a shaft (connected to the wheels via bevel gears). Secondary and primary suspension is solved by hydropneumatic springs. The engines (2x 65 kW on each chassis) are mounted longitudinally. A total of two units are operated by ZET in Zagreb, Croatia, one was delivered on 29 December 2009, the other on 1 May 2010. In 2017, further 60 units were planned to be ordered, but this was never realised. Eventually, an order of a new model that will be an improvement over TMK 2300 was made. Liepājas tramvajs of Liepāja, Latvia ordered 14 units in 2018, under the name TMK 2300 LT. The purchase was partially financed by the European Union fund 'Tram Line and Adjacent Area Reconstruction Phase 2'. On November 14, 2022, the last of the contracted vehicles was delivered to Liepāja. "Tram for Latvia highlights Croatian capabilities". Railway Gazette. Retrieved 1 September 2023.
