Snowboarding at the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Bokwang Phoenix Park and Alpensia Ski Jumping Stadium in Pyeongchang, South Korea. A total of ten snowboarding events were scheduled to take place between 10 and 24 February 2018.

Each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter a maximum of 26 athletes, with a maximum of 14 men or 14 women.
