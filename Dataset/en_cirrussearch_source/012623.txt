Lidl–Trek (UCI team code: LTK) is a professional road bicycle racing team at UCI WorldTeam level licensed in the United States. Formerly RadioShack–Nissan, in 2014, Trek took over the ownership of the team and its ProTeam License. The team was founded in 2011 under the name of Leopard Trek and officially stylized as LEOPARD TREK with Brian Nygaard and Kim Andersen as team managers. The Schleck brothers were under contract with the Danish team Saxo Bank managed by Bjarne Riis through the end of the 2010 season. Several other Team Saxo Bank riders followed the Schleck brothers to the new team, including veterans Jens Voigt, Fabian Cancellara and Stuart O'Grady. Subsequent signings included sprinter Daniele Bennati, Davide Viganò and Joost Posthuma. The team became active at the start of the 2011 cycling season. On December 13, 2010, Jakob Fuglsang revealed that the team would be called Team Leopard, in reference to the management company run by Nygaard. Trek, the bike supplier, confirmed shortly before the team was officially presented that they would be a co-title sponsor, giving the team a full name of "Leopard Trek." Team rider Wouter Weylandt died as a result of a high-speed, downhill crash during the 2011 Giro d'Italia. The remaining riders of Leopard Trek left the competition at the completion of the following day's stage. For the 2012 season, the team was renamed RadioShack–Nissan–Trek. The reason is that the American Team RadioShack ceased racing, and their former sponsors joined the Luxembourg Cycling Project. Johan Bruyneel along with several riders from Team RadioShack moved to the new team. The lineup for 2012 was officially confirmed on December 5, 2011. The official UCI name for the team is RadioShack Nissan and it is registered in Luxembourg. While the UCI ProTeam is now named RadioShack–Nissan–Trek, in December 2011 Leopard also launched a UCI Continental Team, consisting mainly of U23 riders, called Leopard-Trek. On July 17, 2012, Fränk Schleck was removed from the 2012 Tour de France by the team during the second rest day after his A-sample returned traces of Xipamide. Team RadioShack–Nissan won the team classification of the Tour de France. Johan Bruyneel stood down as General Manager on October 12 in the aftermath of the publication by the US Anti-Doping Agency of its "reasoned decision" on the Lance Armstrong doping case. On December 21, 2012, Nissan announced that they would cease to sponsor the team, with immediate effect. During the 2013 Tour de France Team RadioShack-Leopard announced that they would not renew Fränk Schleck's contract, leaving him without a team. It also caused a serious and public rift between his brother Andy Schleck and team management, putting his future with the team into doubt. In September 2013, Chris Horner beat Vincenzo Nibali to win the 2013 Vuelta a España becoming the oldest grand tour winner in history, winning two stages along the way. On July 3, the team announced that Samsung would become a new minor sponsor of the team. On December 16, 2015, the team announced that Italian coffee brand Segafredo had committed to a three-year co-title sponsorship effective January 1, 2016, with the team changing name to Trek–Segafredo. In April the team announced US software company CA Technologies would sponsor the team with immediate effect until the end of the 2017 season. In March 2017 the deal was extended through 2019. For the 2017 season, the team announced the signings of Alberto Contador, John Degenkolb (until 2019), Koen de Kort (until 2018), Jarlinson Pantano, and Ivan Basso. The team suspended the 2019 junior road race world champion Quinn Simmons for actions on Twitter, where he used a black hand emoji that Trek–Segafredo considered racially insensitive In 2023, it was announced that both the men's and women's teams would rebrand as Lidl–Trek, thanks to sponsorship from supermarket chain Lidl. This rebrand would come into effect on June 30, prior to the Giro Donne and the Tour de France / Tour de France Femmes. On June 27, 2017, the UCI announced André Cardoso tested positive for erythropoietin in an out-of-competition control on June 18 and has been provisionally suspended. He had been due to support Alberto Contador in his bid for the 2017 Tour de France, with Haimar Zubeldia taking the empty roster place. In April 2019, Cycling Anti-Doping Foundation confirmed that Jarlinson Pantano had returned an adverse analytical finding for EPO, in a doping test carried out on February 26. Pantano was immediately suspended by the team.
