Precipitation is high year-round and as a result of the cold winter nights, snowfall is frequent in winter. Due to the mild afternoons, this snow seldom sticks around for long periods of time. Summers are warm with frequent convective rainfall. The skies are generally gloomy, with a slight reversal of the trend during summer. "Arealstatistik Standard - Gemeinden nach 4 Hauptbereichen".
