In a review in the Entertainment Weekly magazine, the song received a "B+" rating. The review commented that the song is a "surprisingly lovely pop-punk pounder about intercontinental relationships." Joe DeAndrea from AbsolutePunk said that "Jet Lag is Simple Plan's first big single in a long time, almost in vein of No Pads' "I'd Do Anything." Not as rocking, but packs the same similar punch." Davey Boy from Sputnikmusic was also positive, saying that "English pop songstress Natasha Bedingfield fares best with the call and response vocals of 'Jet Lag' making for an effective radio pop-rocker that plies the oft-used theme of long-distance relationships." The music video for "Jet Lag" was filmed at Toronto Sheraton Gateway Hotel and Toronto Pearson International Airport and released on May 4, 2011. In the video, the band performs within the airport. In addition, lead singer Pierre Bouvier and Natasha Bedingfield play a long-distance relationship couple.
