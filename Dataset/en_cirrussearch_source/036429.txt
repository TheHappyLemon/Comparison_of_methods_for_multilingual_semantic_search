From the 13th century to the mediatisation of 1803, Buchau had the particularity of being the seat of both an Imperial Abbey and a Free Imperial City, independent of each other. In terms of area, it was one of the smallest such self-ruling cities and its island situation eliminated the necessity to erect city walls and towers. Buchau, however, lost its insular benefits after the water level of Lake Federsee had been lowered on two occasions.

She rests together with her slain sons in the crypt of the collegiate church. 1014 or 1022 – A mint and market is mentioned by the Abbey.
