Turkistan (Kazakh: Түркістан, romanized: Türkıstan) is a city and the administrative center of Turkistan Region of Kazakhstan, near the Syr Darya river. It is situated 160 km (100 mi) north-west of Shymkent on the Trans-Aral Railway between Kyzylorda to the north and Tashkent to the south. Its population has increased in ten years from 102,505 (1999 Census results) to 142,899 (2009 Census results). Turkistan's most prominent historical and cultural asset is the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The city is served by Hazrat Sultan International Airport. In 2021, Turkistan was proclaimed by the Organization of Turkic States as "Spiritual Capital of the Turkic World". In the same year, Turkistan was named as one of the top ten tourist destinations in Kazakhstan. Turkistan, one of Kazakhstan's historic cities, has an archaeological record dating back to the 4th century. The city emerged as a commercial hub following the decline of Otrar, an ancient city with remnants located southeast near the Syr Darya. For a significant portion of the medieval to early-modern era, it was referred to as Iasy or Shavgar. By the 16th-17th centuries, it was named Turkistan or Hazrat. Both names originate from 'Hazrat-i Turkistan', translating to "the Saint of Turkistan". This title honors Khoja Akhmet Yassawi, an 11th-century Sufi Sheikh from Turkistan, who lived and rests in the town. Owing to his impact and in honor of his legacy, the city evolved into a significant hub for spiritual growth and Islamic education for the inhabitants of the Kazakh steppes. In the 1390s, Timur, the Turco-Mongol leader and the originator of the Timurid dynasty, constructed an impressive domed mazar or mausoleum over Yassawi's resting place. This structure stands as one of the most notable architectural landmarks in Kazakhstan. Until 2006, its image was featured on the reverse side of the country's banknotes. The city also boasts other significant historical landmarks such as a medieval bath-house and four mausoleums. One of these is dedicated to Rabiya Sultan Begim, Timur's great-granddaughter, while the other three pay tribute to Kazakh khans (rulers). Prior to the 19th-century Russian arrival, Turkistan was positioned at the boundary between the established Perso-Islamic oasis civilization of Transoxiana to its south and the vast expanse of the Kazakh steppes to its north. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, Turkistan rose to prominence as the capital of the Kazakh Khanate, becoming the political epicenter of the Kazakh steppe. However, as the Russian Empire expanded its conquests and weakened the Kazakh Khanate, smaller southern states were overtaken. By 1864, Russian General Veryovkin had captured Turkistan for the Kokand Khanate. Subsequently, under Russian rule, it became a part of the Syr-Darya Oblast in the Governor-Generalship of Russian Turkistan. Following the collapse of the Tsarist regime between 1917-18, it briefly joined the Turkistan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. By 1924, it became a part of the Kazakh ASSR within Soviet Russia. On June 19, 2018, Shymkent was removed from the South Kazakhstan Region and placed directly under the governance of Kazakhstan. Concurrently, Turkistan became the regional administrative hub, and the region was renamed the Turkistan Region. In 2021, it was announced that the first 5G city will be set up in Turkistan. This project will be sponsored by Kcell and Ericsson.[clarification needed] The city draws thousands of pilgrims. As per local tradition, visiting Turkistan three times is akin to a single hajj to Mecca, a sentiment echoed in other revered sites across the Muslim world. Such high regard for the Saint led to Turkistan being dubbed the Second Mecca of the East, profoundly influencing the spiritual essence of Kazakhstan's Muslim community. Turkistan had a population of 165,000 in the 2019 census. The population rose by 10% from 1989 to 1999, making it the second fastest-growing town in Kazakhstan, after the new capital Astana. The ethnic composition of the city: Kazakhs – 52.5% Uzbeks – 45.2% Other ethnic groups – 2.3% The ethnic composition of the city according to the 1897 census: total – 11,253 Uzbeks – 8,940 (79.4%) Kazakhs – 1,415 (12.5%) Tatars – 506 (4.4%) Russians – 312 (2.7%) At the same time the ethnic composition of the Chimkent uyezd (Chimkent district) which included the city of Turkistan according to the 1897 census: total – 285,059 Kazakhs – 224,704 (78.8%) Sart (non-nomadic Iranic, Turkic, or Mongolic people)– 32 043 (11.2%) Uzbeks – 20,709 (7.2%) Russians – 6 443 (2.2%) Tatars – 646 (0.2%) In 2021, Keruen-Saray, Central Asia’s largest tourism complex, was opened in Turkistan.
