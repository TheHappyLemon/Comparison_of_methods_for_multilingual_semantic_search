The highest point is a contour line at 730 m (2,400 ft) above sea level. The town is surrounded by several small fishponds. The first written mention of Černovice is from 1322. From 1322 to 1597, it was a property of the Rosenberg family. Černovice was burned down during the Hussite Wars and damaged several times by fires between 1611 and 1857, so almost no historical buildings have survived to this day. Černovice was a market town, which was promoted to a town in the mid-19th century. The landmark of the town square is the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. It was a Gothic church from the 14th century, rebuilt in the Baroque style. Next to the church is a separate bell tower. The Černovice Castle is a late Neoclassical building, surrounded by an extensive landscape park. Today it houses an institute of social care.
