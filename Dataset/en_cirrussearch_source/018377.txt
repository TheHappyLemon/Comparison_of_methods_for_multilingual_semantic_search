Russula queletii otherwise known as the gooseberry russula, is a common, inedible, Russula mushroom found growing in groups, predominantly in spruce forest. Eating this mushroom causes abdominal pains. The cap is hemispherical when young, which later becomes convex. The colour can be wine-red and is usually 5 to 6 cm in diameter but can be up to 10 cm. The gills are white, which are brittle, and the spores are cream. The stem is a similar colour to the cap and evenly thick. The flesh is white and the scent is fruity.[additional citation(s) needed] Russula sardonia Russula torulosa List of Russula species Miller Jr., Orson K.; Miller, Hope H. (2006).
