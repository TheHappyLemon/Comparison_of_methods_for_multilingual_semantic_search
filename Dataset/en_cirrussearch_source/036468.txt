Psyllic acid (also psyllostearic acid, tritriacontanoic acid or ceromelissic acid) is a saturated fatty acid. The rare fatty acid occurs in insect waxes, in the wax of wax scale insects, in the propolis of bees and bumblebees and in a few plants. Its name is derived from the alder leaf flea (Psylla alni). The alkali salts of psyllic acid are precipitated when alcoholic solutions of the acid and an alkali hydroxide are mixed. The silver and barium salts can be obtained by adding aqueous alcoholic solutions of silver nitrate and barium chloride to alcoholic solutions of the acid. The following salts have been analyzed: C33H65O2Na, C66H130O4Ba, and C33H65O2Ag. Psylla wax is hydrolyzed by alcoholic potassium hydroxide as well as by hydrobromic acid. Psyllic acid is present in Chinese wolfberries. List of saturated fatty acids "Abstracts of Papers on Organic Chemistry". Journal of the Chemical Society. 94 (1): 123. 1908. Retrieved 2010-05-10.
