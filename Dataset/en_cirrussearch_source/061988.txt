The name "Zugdidi" (ზუგდიდი) first appeared in the 17th century. Literally it means "big hill" in the Mingrelian language (from ზუგუ zugu, 'hill'; დიდი didi 'big'). An alternative version of the name recorded in old sources is "Zubdidi" (ზუბდიდი) with the same meaning as Megrelian. Local Georgian (Megrelian) residents of the historical provinces of Megrelia and Abkhazia also use "Zugidi" (ზუგიდი), which is a shortened form. The name was given to the town because of a hill situated in the eastern part of the city, where some small remains of an ancient fortress are still visible. Historically Zugdidi was the capital of the Principality of Mingrelia (Odishi) until 1867 when the principality was abolished by the Russian Empire.

At the end of the 1855 and beginning of 1856 city was liberated by the Mingrelian Militia commanded by Major General Prince Grigol Dadiani.

Historically Zugdidi is known as a distinctly mono-ethnic city with a vast majority of Georgians. By the 2002 state census, 98.97% (166,039) of its total population (167,760) were ethnic Georgians (for both city and municipality). In the second half of the 1850s, due to the short Ottoman occupation, the town population decreased from 2000 to 800. The 1950s-1970s were an important period for Zugdidi's development, which affected the growth of the population, while the last 20-year growth was mainly caused by refugee displacement. After the Russian-Georgian war in Abkhazia (1992-1993) a large number of internally displaced peoples from Abkhazia were forced to move to Zugdidi. As a result of this, according to the 2002 state census, Zugdidi became the fifth most populous city in Georgia, ahead of Sokhumi, Poti, and Gori. As of the 2014 national census, the population of Zugdidi decreased to 42,998 inhabitants, making it Georgia's sixth most populous city after Gori.
