Panevėžio Ekranas was a Lithuanian defunct football club, from the city of Panevėžys. It won 7 top-tier champion and 5 national cup titles throughout its existence. The club was founded in 1964 and for 44 years competed in the top tier of Lithuanian football. However, at the end of 2014 season the club ran into financial difficulties, failed to meet admission criteria to A Lyga for the 2015 season and was subsequently declared bankrupt. A new club FK Panevėžys was formed to represent the city of Panevėžys, which managed to pass licensing criteria for the 2015 I Lyga season. FK Ekranas was declared bankrupt in 2016. In 2020 FK Ekranas was restored. It plays in the 2nd tier of Lithuania. FK Ekranas won Lithuanian championships in 1985 (Soviet Lithuania), 1993, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Lithuanian Cup in 1985 (Soviet Lithuania), 1998, 2000, 2010 and 2011 and the Lithuanian Super Cup in 1998, 2006, 2010, 2011 and 2012. On 5 November 2004, before the A Lyga champion-deciding match against FBK Kaunas, the club was controversially expelled from the top division by the National Football Club Association (NFKA) for alleged match fixing, but reinstated a day later. In August 2006 FK Ekranas won the first Baltic Champion's Cup tournament in Liepāja after beating Estonian champions TVMK Tallinn 6–4 and drawing with the home side Liepājas Metalurgs 1–1.
