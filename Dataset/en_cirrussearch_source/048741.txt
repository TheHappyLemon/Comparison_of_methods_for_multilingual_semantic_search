Serbia and Montenegro competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Previously known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, this was the nation's third and last joint appearance at the Summer Olympics before Serbia and Montenegro became separated independent states in 2006. The Olympic Committee of Serbia and Montenegro sent a total of 85 athletes to the Games, 78 men and 7 women, to compete in 14 sports. Men's basketball, football, volleyball, and water polo were the only team-based sports in which Serbia and Montenegro had its representation at these Games. There was only a single competitor in road cycling, judo, tennis, and wrestling. The Serbia and Montenegro team featured several Olympic medalists from Sydney, including the reigning men's volleyball champions (led by team captain Vladimir Grbić), and pistol shooter Jasna Šekarić, who became the first Serbian athlete to compete in five Olympic Games under three different banners (the other were SFR Yugoslavia and Independent Olympic Participants). Meanwhile, four Serbia and Montenegro athletes had made their fourth Olympic appearance: high jumper Dragutin Topić, shot putter Dragan Perić (the oldest of the team at age 40), rifle shooter Stevan Pletikosić, and table tennis player Slobodan Grujić. Basketball team captain Dejan Bodiroga was appointed by the committee to become the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Serbia and Montenegro ended its last Olympic journey as a joint nation in Athens with two Olympic silver medals from Sekaric and the men's water polo team (led by Viktor Jelenić).
