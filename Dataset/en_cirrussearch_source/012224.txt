Hrysopiyi "Piyi" Devetzi (Greek: Χρυσοπηγή Δεβετζή, [xrisopiˈʝi ðeveˈdzi], born January 2, 1976) is a retired Greek athlete who competed in the triple jump and long jump. Devetzi was born in Alexandroupoli. She won the triple jump silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics with 15.25 and the triple jump bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics with 15.23. At the 2004 Summer Olympics semifinal she set a Greek record of 15.32 metres. This performance ranked her in the fourth place of all time triple jumpers, after the world record holder, Inessa Kravets, her greatest rival Tatyana Lebedeva and the twice-olympic gold medalist Françoise Mbango Etone. She won another silver medal at the 2006 European Athletics Championships in Gothenburg, losing the gold at the last jump by Tatyana Lebedeva. The same story was repeated at the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Valencia, in which "Piyi" lost the 1st place at the sixth jump by Yargelis Savigne. Devetzi was known for often jumping longer in qualification rounds than in finals, as at the 2004 Olympics, and also for her lack of gold at major championships, despite having been one of the world's leading female triple jumpers. In May 2009 Devetzi refused to submit to doping control. Failing to submit sample equals a positive test, and she was subsequently handed a two-year doping ban. In 2016, samples given by Devetzi in August 2007 were retested revealing stanozolol. Her subsequent results (for the next four years), covering the time until her retirement, were annulled, including the 2008 Olympic bronze medal. Her 2007 World Championship bronze medal was also annulled. On 17 November 2016 the IOC disqualified Devetzi from the 2008 Olympic Games, stripped her Olympic bronze medal and struck her long jump and triple jump results from the record for failing a drugs test in a re-analysis of her doping sample from 2008.
