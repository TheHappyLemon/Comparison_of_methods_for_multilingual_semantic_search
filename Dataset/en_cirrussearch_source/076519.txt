"Der er et yndigt land" (Danish pronunciation: [tɛɐ̯ ˈɛɐ̯ e̝t ˈøntit ˈlænˀ, tɑ -]; lit. 'There is a lovely country') is one of the two national anthems of Denmark. The lyrics were written in 1819 by Adam Oehlenschläger and bore the motto in Latin: Ille terrarum mihi praeter omnes angulus ridet (Horace: "This corner of the earth smiles for me more than any other"). The music was composed in 1835 by Hans Ernst Krøyer. Later, Thomas Laub and Carl Nielsen each composed alternative melodies, but neither of them has gained widespread adoption, and today they are mostly unknown to the general population. When first published, the national anthem had twelve verses, but this was shortened to the first, third, fifth, and last verse in later editions. Denmark is one of only two countries in the world — the other being New Zealand – with two official national anthems. Officially, "Kong Christian stod ved højen mast" is both a national and a royal anthem; it has equal status with "Der er et yndigt land", which is treated as the civil national anthem. On official and military occasions, "Kong Christian" is performed alone, or the two national anthems are played together. Digital piano instrumental version (melody only) Problems playing this file?
