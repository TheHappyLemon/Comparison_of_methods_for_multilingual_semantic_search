It was selected as the Latvian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. In the 2017 Latvian film festival Lielais Kristaps The Chronicles of Melanie won the award as the Best feature film, while members of the film crew received awards as the Best Director, Best Actress, Best Design and Best Costume Design. Wendy Ide of Screen Daily described the film as "a potent account of the human cost of Soviet ethnic cleansing in the Baltic region". She compared it to the 2014 Estonian film In the Crosswind, which also is about a woman subjected to the June deportation, and wrote that The Chronicles of Melanie is "less experimental in approach". Ide wrote: "The distorted sound creates a sense of delirium; the painfully slow movements of the malnourished women gives the film a nightmarish quality. Time slows down, both for the exiled Latvian women and also, at times, for the audience. It all amounts to a challenging viewing experience."
