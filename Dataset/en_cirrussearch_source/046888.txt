Académico de Viseu Futebol Clube is a Portuguese professional football club based in Viseu. Founded in 1914 as Clube Académico de Futebol, the club went through several changes over the course of the years, folding in 2005 due to financial troubles and re-founding under its current name. The club currently play in the Liga Portugal 2, holding home games at Estádio do Fontelo, with a capacity of around 9,000. In 2005, Clube Académico de Futebol, an historic founded officially in 1914 which competed in four top division seasons in the 1980s (the last being 1988–89), folded due to financial problems. In September 2005, Clube Académico de Futebol and G.D. Farminhão signed a protocol which made the latter change its name to "Académico de Viseu Futebol Clube", its headquarters to Viseu, its stadium to Estádio do Fontelo and its logo and colours to be the same as the extinct Clube Académico de Futebol, thus preserving the former and historic Clube Académico de Futebol. Académico de Viseu Futebol Clube started competing again immediately in the Viseu first regional league, achieving promotion to the fourth tier Terceira Divisão in their second season in 2007. In the last match of the 2008–09 season, after a 2–0 win against Anadia FC, the team was promoted to the third division, a feat which was accomplished on goal difference. They would, however, be immediately relegated back. In the 2012/2013 season the team achieved promotion to the Segunda Liga and achieved a solid 11th place in the following season. In 2014/2015, they remained in this division. As of 9 February 2024 Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.
