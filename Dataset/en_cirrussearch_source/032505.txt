Hong Sang-soo (홍상수, born 25 October 1960) is a South Korean film director and screenwriter. An acclaimed and prolific filmmaker, Hong is known for his slow-paced films about love affairs and everyday dilemmas in contemporary South Korea. Hong's parents owned the film production company Cinetel Soul. Hong took the entrance exam and entered the theater department at Chung-Ang University. He then studied in the United States, where he received his bachelor's degree from the California College of Arts and Crafts and his master's at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Hong made his directorial debut in 1996 with The Day a Pig Fell into the Well. Woman is the Future of Man (2004) was his first film to screen in the main competition at the Cannes Film Festival. Hong's films have also screened in the main competition of the Berlin International Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, and the Locarno Film Festival. They are also regularly screened in non-competitive festivals, such as the New York Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival. Hong received the Prix Un Certain Regard at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival for Hahaha. In 2013, he won the Silver Leopard Award for Best Director for Our Sunhi, and, in 2015, the Golden Leopard for Right Now, Wrong Then, both at the Locarno Film Festival. Most recently, his 2020 film The Woman Who Ran won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, Introduction won the Silver Bear for Best Screenplay, and The Novelist's Film (2022) won the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival. Hong's films often treat themes of domestic realism, with many of the scenes set on residential streets, cafes, hotels, schools, and in the stairwells of apartment buildings. Characters in the film are seen walking around the city, drinking soju, and having sex. The main characters are often movie directors or actors, and scenes typically consist of a single shot, often beginning and ending with a camera zoom. The budgets for his movies average about $100,000. Hong is often spontaneous when shooting, delivering the day's scene on the morning of the shoot and changing the story on set. He rarely prepares scripts in advance. Hong instead begins with a basic guideline and writes his scenes on the morning of the filming day, making changes throughout the day. He starts the filming day at 4 a.m. when he begins to write the dialogue for that day's shoot. Hong also develops close relationships with the actors over alcohol and cigarettes and sometimes shoots scenes while the actors are intoxicated. Hong's style has been compared to Eric Rohmer's, with some arguing that some of his films deliberately allude to Rohmer's. In 2016, Hong was reported to be having an extramarital affair with actress Kim Min-hee, who appeared in his 2015 film Right Now, Wrong Then. Hong admitted to the affair in March 2017, at the Seoul premiere of On the Beach at Night Alone. He filed for divorce from his wife in December 2016, but the court rejected his request in June 2019, insisting that only the injured party, Hong's wife, could initiate a legal separation. 1996 - 17th Blue Dragon Film Awards: Best New Director for The Day a Pig Fell into the Well 1996 - 16th Korean Association of Film Critics Awards: Best New Director for The Day a Pig Fell into the Well 1998 - 19th Blue Dragon Film Awards: Best Director; Best Screenplay for The Power of Kangwon Province 2000 - 1st Busan Film Critics Awards: Best Screenplay for Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors 2006 - 9th Director's Cut Awards: Best Director for Woman on the Beach 2008 - 28th Korean Association of Film Critics Awards: Best Screenplay for Night and Day 2010 - 19th Buil Film Awards: Best Director for Hahaha 2013 - 14th Busan Film Critics Awards: Special Jury Prize for Our Sunhi 2014 - 23rd Buil Film Awards: Best Director for Our Sunhi 2015 - 2nd Wildflower Film Awards: Best Director, Narrative Films for Hill of Freedom 2017 - Busan Film Critics Awards: Grand Prize for On the Beach at Night Alone 2017 - Busan Film Critics Awards: Grand Prize for The Day After 2018 - 5th Wildflower Film Awards: Best Director, Narrative Films for The Day After 2022 - Busan Film Critics Awards: Grand Prize for In Front of Your Face 2023 - 24th Busan Film Critics Awards: Special Jury Prize for Walk Up 1996 - 15th Vancouver International Film Festival: Dragons and Tigers Award for The Day a Pig Fell into the Well 1997 - 42nd Asia Pacific Film Festival: Best New Director for The Day a Pig Fell into the Well 1997 - International Film Festival Rotterdam: Tiger Award for The Day a Pig Fell into the Well 1999 - Singapore International Film Festival: NETPAC-FIPRESCI Special Mention for The Power of Kangwon Province 1999 - Santa Barbara International Film Festival: Burning Vision Award for The Power of Kangwon Province 2000 - 45th Asia Pacific Film Festival: Best Screenplay for Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors 2000 - 13th Tokyo International Film Festival: Special Jury Prize for Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors 2002 - 47th Asia Pacific Film Festival: Best Director for On the Occasion of Remembering the Turning Gate 2003 - Seattle International Film Festival: Emerging Masters Showcase Award 2007 - 22nd Mar del Plata International Film Festival: Best Director for Woman on the Beach 2010 - 63rd Cannes Film Festival: Prix Un Certain Regard for Hahaha 2011 - 40th International Film Festival Rotterdam: Return of the Tiger Award for Oki's Movie 2013 - 66th Locarno International Film Festival: Best Director for Our Sunhi 2015 - 68th Locarno International Film Festival: Golden Leopard for Right Now, Wrong Then 2016 - 64th San Sebastián International Film Festival: Best Director for Yourself and Yours 2017 - Jerusalem Film Festival: Best International Film for On the Beach at Night Alone 2017 - LA Film Festival: World Fiction Award for On the Beach at Night Alone 2018 - Gijón International Film Festival: Winner for Hotel by the River 2018 - Gijón International Film Festival: Best Screenplay for Hotel by the River 2020 - 70th Berlin International Film Festival: Silver Bear for Best Director for The Woman Who Ran 2021 - 71st Berlin International Film Festival: Silver Bear for Best Screenplay for Introduction 2021 - Gijón International Film Festival: Special Jury Award for In Front of Your Face 2022 - 72nd Berlin International Film Festival: Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize for The Novelist's Film 2024 - 74th Berlin International Film Festival: Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize for A Traveler's Needs Honors are given at the Korean Popular Culture and Arts Awards, arranged by the Korea Creative Content Agency and hosted by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.
