These were the team rosters of the nations participating in the men's ice hockey tournament of the 2018 Winter Olympics. Each team was permitted a roster of 22 skaters and 3 goaltenders. After five consecutive Olympic tournaments in which the National Hockey League (the world's premier professional league) allowed its players to participate in the Olympics and adjusted its schedule to accommodate the tournament, the NHL announced in 2017 that it would prohibit any player under NHL contract, including those not actually playing for an NHL team, from participating in the Olympics. The NHL secured the cooperation of the International Ice Hockey Federation and the IOC ensuring that nations would not be allowed to ask NHL players to participate. Unlike the NHL, the vast majority of European leagues accommodated an Olympic break, headlined by Russia-based KHL's 33-day break, Sweden-based Swedish Hockey League's 14-day break, Switzerland-based National League's 25-day break, German-based Eishockey Liga's 26-day break, Czech Republic-based Extraliga's 18-day break, and Slovakia-based Tipsport liga's 14-day break. Conversely, Finland-based SM-liiga did not accommodate a break but allowed its top players to leave the clubs and participate in the Olympic Games. Team Canada was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 31 years. Gold medal winner Team Russia was the youngest, averaging 28 years. The tournament average was 29 years and 6 months.
