The game is part of the Fire Pro Wrestling series. Like other titles in the Fire Pro Wrestling series, Fire Pro Wrestling Returns distinguishes itself from other wrestling games by focusing on timing and strategy, as opposed to button-mashing. Fire Pro Wrestling Returns offers a roster of 327 wrestlers from a variety of real-life wrestling companies. Players can create custom characters, wrestling rings, belts, promotions, and referees.[citation needed] Returns supplies new customizing tools, such as a "Face Layer" feature that allows players to create a wrestler's face using multiple objects. Game modes include a traditional cage match, Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch, and Match Maker mode, wherein the player must book shows and try to get a good grade on the shows based on crowd reaction.[citation needed] Reception The game received "generally favorable reviews" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 31 out of 40. Video games portal List of licensed wrestling video games List of fighting games "Fire Pro Wrestling Returns - PlayStation 2". Amazon.com.
