Vincent Philippe Antoine Candela (born 24 October 1973) is a French former professional footballer who played as a full-back; he is most well-known for his time playing for Italian club Roma. Candela earned 40 caps for the France national team and was part of the squads that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. Candela was born in Bédarieux, Hérault. At club level, Candela played football in France with Toulouse (1992–95) and Guingamp (1995–97), before moving to Italian side AS Roma (1997–2005). He won one scudetto with Roma, as well as the Supercoppa Italiana, in 2001, also helping the club to the 2003 Coppa Italia Final. He later joined English side Bolton Wanderers (2005), before returning to Italy to play for Udinese (2005–2006), and Siena (2006–2007), as well as spending a spell on loan with Messina (2007). On 28 January 2007 he played his last Serie A match for Messina against Ascoli. For France, Candela was capped 40 times between 1996 and 2003, scoring two goals. His playing time was often limited by Bixente Lizarazu, but he did play in one match during France's 1998 FIFA World Cup triumph on home soil. During France's triumphant Euro 2000 campaign, Candela played two matches, both as a starter. He also played for France at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, and at the 2002 FIFA World Cup.[citation needed] Candela was a quick, offensive-minded, and technically skilled left wingback, who was effective at joining the attack as well as being capable in defence, due to his intelligence and tenacity. Although he preferred playing on the left flank, he was naturally right-footed, and was also capable of playing on the right, both as a full-back, and as a winger, and was an accurate crosser and set-piece taker. Includes Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue, Coppa Italia, Supercoppa Italiana and FA Cup. Includes UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup and UEFA Intertoto Cup.
