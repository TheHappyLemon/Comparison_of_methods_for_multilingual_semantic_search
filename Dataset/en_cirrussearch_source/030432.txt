However, television and radio broadcasts still use the full arena name.

The win also ended the Warriors' losing streak at AT&T Center, with their last win occurring in 1997. The Warriors also recorded their 34th road win of the season, which surpassed that same 1995–96 Chicago Bulls team for the most road wins by a team in a single season in NBA history. The win also ensured that the Warriors would become both the first team in NBA history to go through a full regular season without ever losing back-to-back games as well as the first team in NBA history to go through a full regular season without ever losing multiple games to a single opponent. On April 10, 2016, San Antonio's home loss to the Golden State Warriors snapped their NBA-record streak of 39 consecutive home wins to begin a season and their regular season home game winning streak of 48 games dating back to the previous year, which was second to only Golden State's record 54 straight regular-season home game winning streak for the longest in NBA history. On April 10, 2016, the Philadelphia 76ers became the sixth team to lose seventy games in a season, following the 1972–73 76ers, the 1986–87 Los Angeles Clippers, the 1992–93 Dallas Mavericks, the 1997–98 Denver Nuggets and the 2009–10 New Jersey Nets. The 76ers became the first team in NBA history to lose at least 70 regular season games in two separate seasons. The 76ers would finish 10–72, one win ahead of their own worst 82-game record set in the 1972–73 season. On April 11, 2016, Russell Westbrook recorded his 18th triple-double of the season, tying Magic Johnson for the most triple-doubles by a single player in a single season since the ABA–NBA merger in 1976. On April 12, 2016, the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 102–98 in overtime to tie the 1985–86 Boston Celtics for the best regular season home record in NBA history (40–1), with their only regular season home loss occurring on April 10 against the Golden State Warriors. The Spurs' win also assured that they would end the regular season with a winning percentage higher than .800, making this season the first in NBA history in which two teams (the other team being the Warriors) ended the regular season with winning percentages higher than .800. On April 13, 2016, the Golden State Warriors won their final game of the year to finish the regular season with a 73–9 record, thus setting an NBA record for most regular season wins in one season. The previous record belonged to the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls, who finished with a 72–10 record. This was the first season in NBA history in which a team would not lose back-to-back regular season games, as well as the first season in NBA history in which a team would not lose to the same opponent twice in the regular season (both of those feats were accomplished by the Golden State Warriors). On April 13, 2016, Kobe Bryant, playing in the final NBA game of his career, scored 60 points in a comeback win against the Jazz. Kobe became the oldest player ever to score 60 points in a game, and set the record for most points scored by a player in their final career game. Bryant shot a career-high 50 field goal attempts and 21 three-point attempts in the game, and became just the fifth player in NBA history to shoot at least 10,000 career free throw attempts. On April 13, 2016, Stephen Curry became the first player in NBA history to make 400 three-pointers in a single season. Curry made a total of 10 three-pointers during the Golden State Warriors' NBA-record 73rd regular season win to finish the regular season with a total of 402 three-pointers, 116 more three-pointers than his previous NBA record mark for most three-pointers in a single season (286). James Harden set an NBA single-season record for turnovers with 374. On April 7, he tied the previous record of 366, set by Artis Gilmore of the Chicago Bulls during the 1977–78 season (the first season that individual turnovers were recorded), and in his next game, on April 10, he broke the record. For the first time since 2004–05, all eight seeded teams in the East finished with a record over .500 in a full season (thus excluding the 2011–12 season, which was shortened to 66 games due to a strike). On April 20, 2016, the Cleveland Cavaliers made 20 three-pointers in a 107–90 win against the Detroit Pistons, tying the NBA record for the most made three-pointers by a team in a playoff game. On April 24, 2016, the Golden State Warriors made 21 three-pointers during their 121–94 win against the Houston Rockets, which set a new NBA record for the most three-pointers made by a team in a playoff game. The former record for most three-pointers made by a team in a playoff game was 20, which the Cleveland Cavaliers had equaled only four days beforehand. On April 27, 2016, Klay Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score at least seven 3-pointers in consecutive playoff games. On April 29, 2016, with the Pacers' 101–83 win over the Raptors in Game 6 of their first-round playoff series, it was ensured that there would be at least one Game 7 in the playoffs for the seventeenth straight year. The last time when there were no Game 7's at any point during the playoffs came during the 1999 NBA playoffs. On May 1, 2016, the Toronto Raptors beat the Indiana Pacers 89–84 for their first Game 7 victory in franchise history. It was the Raptors' first ever best-of-seven games playoff series win and their first playoff series win overall since 2001. On May 1, 2016, Klay Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score at least seven 3-pointers in three straight playoff games. On May 4, 2016, the Cleveland Cavaliers set an NBA playoff record by making 18 three-pointers in the first half of their 123–98 rout of the Atlanta Hawks, 10 of which occurred during the second quarter, which also set an NBA playoff record for most three-pointers in a quarter. They then broke the record for the most three-pointers in a playoff game set by the Golden State Warriors ten days earlier with 25 total three-pointers, which set another NBA record for the most three-pointers made by a team in any regular season or postseason game. On May 6, 2016, the Cleveland Cavaliers became the first team in NBA history to hit 20 three-pointers in consecutive games, making 21 in a game against the Atlanta Hawks two days after setting an NBA record with 25. On May 8, 2016, the Cleveland Cavaliers completed a four-game sweep of the Atlanta Hawks with a 100–99 win. The Cavaliers finished the game with 16 three-pointers, making them the first team in NBA history to score at least 15 three-pointers in four consecutive games. On May 9, 2016, Stephen Curry returned to play after missing two weeks due to a MCL sprain and scored 40 points to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 132–125 overtime win against the Portland Trail Blazers. Curry scored 17 of his 40 points during the overtime period, setting an NBA record for most points ever scored by a single player in an overtime period in any NBA regular season or postseason game. On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry also became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes. Previously, Shaquille O'Neal and LeBron James were the two players that had come closest to winning the MVP award by unanimous vote, falling short by one vote in the 1999–2000 and 2012–13 seasons, respectively. On May 11, 2016, Stephen Curry scored five 3-pointers in the Golden State Warriors' 125–121 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, extending his streak of consecutive playoff games with at least one made 3-pointer to 44 games, which tied the NBA record set by Reggie Miller. On May 15, 2016, the Toronto Raptors earned their first Eastern Conference Finals appearance in franchise history, beating the Miami Heat four games to three in their semifinal series. On May 16, 2016, Stephen Curry made a 3-pointer in his 45th consecutive playoff game, which surpassed Reggie Miller (44) for the NBA record of most consecutive playoff games with at least one made 3-pointer. On May 19, 2016, Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue became the first coach in NBA history to win his first 10 playoff games. On May 25, 2016, the Cleveland Cavaliers set a conference finals record by taking a 31-point lead at halftime against the Toronto Raptors. On May 27, 2016, LeBron James became the eighth player in NBA history to reach six straight NBA Finals. James is the first player to not be part of the Boston Celtics' 1960s dynasty and the first player in 50 years to accomplish the feat. On May 28, 2016, New Orleans Pelicans player Bryce Dejean-Jones died when he was shot after breaking into a Dallas apartment. He is the first active NBA player to die since 2007 when Eddie Griffin was killed in a vehicular accident. On May 28, 2016, Klay Thompson set an NBA playoff record with 11 three-pointers during the Golden State Warriors' 108–101 win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. On May 30, 2016, the Golden State Warriors became the 3rd defending champion in NBA history, and the 10th team overall, to come back and win a best-of-seven playoff series after facing a 3–1 series deficit.[citation needed] On June 5, 2016, the Golden State Warriors tied the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls for the most combined regular season and postseason wins in a single season (87) in NBA history by defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 2 of the NBA Finals. On June 10, 2016, the Golden State Warriors earned their 88th win of the season (regular season and playoffs combined) by defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 4 of the NBA Finals, surpassing the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls' record of most combined regular season and postseason wins in a single season in NBA history. During the game, the Warriors also made 17 three-pointers, setting a record for most made three-pointers by a single team in an NBA Finals game. On June 13, 2016, Kyrie Irving and LeBron James became the first pair of teammates in NBA history to score 40 or more points each in the same NBA Finals game during the Cleveland Cavaliers' 112–97 victory in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. On June 16, 2016, the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Golden State Warriors in Game 6 of the NBA Finals by a score of 115–101, making them only the third team in NBA Finals history to force a Game 7 after falling behind 1–3. The only other two teams to accomplish this feat are the 1950–51 New York Knicks and the 1965–66 Los Angeles Lakers. On June 19, 2016, the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Golden State Warriors 93–89 in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals to claim their first-ever league title. The Warriors became the 11th team overall to lose a seven-game playoff series after leading 3–1, and the first one to do so in the NBA Finals. The Cavaliers became the first NBA team to win a championship by winning a game 7 on the road since the Seattle SuperSonics did so in 1979. On June 19, 2016, LeBron James became the first player, in any playoff series, to lead all players in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. The 1998–99 season was shortened to 50 games by a lockout, but in the shortened season the Grizzlies were on pace for a 13–69 record over a full season and thus a fourth successive sub-20-win season. For comparison, in three consecutive seasons – 1996–97's Vancouver Grizzlies and Boston Celtics; 1997–98's Denver Nuggets and Toronto Raptors; and 1998–99's Vancouver Grizzlies and Los Angeles Clippers—but in no others, two teams finished with winning percentages below .200.
