Infobip is a Croatian IT and telecommunications company, founded in 2006. Infobip was established in the Croatian town of Pula in 2006. In 2014 and 2015, the company downsized its operations in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. In 2020, Infobip raised $200 million from One Equity Partners. Infobip's valuation thus surpassed $1 billion, making it the first Croatian unicorn company. During the same year, Infobip acquired OpenMarket, a company headquartered in Seattle, United States. In July 2022, Infobip finalized its acquisition of Peerless Network, a U.S.-based telecommunications provider founded in 2008. In March 2023 Peerless was issued a Cease and Desist by the United States Federal Trade Commission citing their hosting of spam and scam callers. In September 2017, the company opened its first high-tech campus, named Pangea, built on 17,000 square meters of land in Vodnjan, Croatia. In 2022, Infobip opened its second campus in Zagreb, called Alpha Centauri, designed by 3LHD architectural firm. The 20,000 square meter Alpha Centauri campus, which was named after the star system closest to Earth, is located near Zagreb's Sveta Klara and Remetinec neighborhoods.
