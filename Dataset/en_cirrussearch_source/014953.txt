Beisel was one of 20 castaways to compete on Survivor: Island of the Idols, the 39th edition of the show. Beisel was a starting member of the Lairo tribe, and was the first player to be selected to go to the Island of the Idols, where former players Sandra Diaz-Twine and "Boston" Rob Mariano offered her a chance to receive an advantage if she beat Mariano in a fire making challenge. Beisel lost the challenge to Mariano, subsequently losing her vote. Beisel was voted out on day 30 in the game. The initial vote resulted in a one-one tie between Beisel and Janet Carbin, due to Karishma Patel playing a hidden immunity idol on herself. Beisel was then voted off in a 7-0 vote, making her the twelfth player voted out, placing 9th in the game. Beisel eventually voted for runner up Dean Kowalski to win the game. This season is well known for instances of "inappropriate touching" from contestant Dan Spilo. Beisel, and several others, received backlash from the audience for using this scenario to further their game. Beisel did not attend the season's reunion show, many fans speculate it was due to this drama. Beisel is also engaged to fellow Survivor 39 contestant Jack Nichting.[non-primary source needed] Coincidentally, Beisel and Nichting were never on the same tribe during the game.
