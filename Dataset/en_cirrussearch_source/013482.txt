Phantom Breaker is a fighting video game developed and published by 5pb. for the Xbox 360 in June 2011. An arcade version of the game running on Sega's RingEdge 2 arcade board, titled Phantom Breaker: Another Code, was released in April 2013. In addition, an enhanced edition, titled, Phantom Breaker: Extra, was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2013. A beat 'em up spin-off, Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds, was released via Xbox Live Arcade. The latest update, Phantom Breaker: Omnia, was released worldwide in March 2022 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam by Rocket Panda Games. Phantom Breaker is a 2D fighting game that supports two distinctive fighting styles, the player is able to choose between "Quick" style and "Hard" style. Quick style focuses on quick hits and combos while the other is more about defense. When the player reaches "Overdrive" mode, their character might get an extra increase in speed or defense. Every attack the player releases can cancel out their enemy's attack and raise their tension gauge; timing it right will maximise the player's gauge to boost their attack power. The game's setting takes place in Japan. A mystery organization led by Phantom organised a fighting tournament in Tokyo, whose winner will have their wish granted. Before the release of Phantom Breaker: Omnia, the game had a total of 18 playable characters. An additional "female gang member" character was planned, but never made it into the final game.
