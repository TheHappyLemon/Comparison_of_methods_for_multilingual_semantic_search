4th Saeima was the parliament of Latvia from 3 November 1931 until the 15 May 1934 Latvian coup d'état. It was the last democratically elected Saeima until the restoration of Latvia’s independence in 1991 and the 5th Saeima elections in 1993. Social Democrat Pauls Kalniņš continued to hold the post of Speaker of the Saeima to which he was first elected during the 1st Saeima. During November 1933 – May 1934 Saeima discussed proposed Constitutional changes, submitted by Kārlis Ulmanis and his Farmers’ Union, that would reduce number of MPs from 100 to 50, allow for the direct popular election of State President and increase his powers. 4th Saeima gave confidence to the 2nd cabinet of Marģers Skujenieks (6 December 1931 – 23 March 1933), cabinet of Ādolfs Bļodnieks (24 March 1933 – 16 March 1934) and the 4th cabinet of Kārlis Ulmanis (17 March 1934 – 15 May 1934). 4th Saeima elections were held on 3–4 October 1931 and 80,04% of eligible voters participated. Due to the liberal Elections law, 27 parties and candidates lists were elected to the 100 seats, representing all the political and ethnic interest groups of Latvia. Of the 100 elected MPs, 1 was a woman, 83 were Latvians, 43 had a higher education, 39 had a secondary education, 12 had been educated at people's schools, 3 at military schools, 1 at an agricultural school, 1 at a trade school, and 1 was self-educated.
