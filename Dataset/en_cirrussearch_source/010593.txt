June 24 – From the English garrison at Stirling Castle in Scottish territory, Sir Philip Mowbray proposes a truce with Edward Bruce, brother of King Robert the Bruce of Scotland, after a siege of "many months". Edward Bruce agrees to what Scottish historian Patrick Fraser Tytler will describe five centuries later as "a truce involving conditions which ought on no account to have been accepted." As Tytler notes, the effect "was to check the ardour of the Scots in that career of success, which was now rapidly leading to the complete deliverance of their country; it gave the King of England a whole year to assemble the strength of his dominions... We need not wonder, then, that Bruce was highly incensed, on hearing that, without consulting him, his brother had agreed to Mowbray's proposals." July 29 – In a complicated marital pact, Catherine of Valois–Courtenay, the Latin Empress of Constantinople, breaks her engagement to Hugh V, Duke of Burgundy, styled the King of Thessalonica in order to marry Philip I, Prince of Taranto, styled the King of Albania and Lord of Achaea.

On the same day as Philip's marriage to Catherine, former fiancée of Hugh, Hugh's brother Louis of Burgundy marries Matilda of Hainaut (who had broken off her engagement to Philip of Taranto's son Charles of Taranto) and Philip of Taranto cedes the Principality of Achaea to Hugh and Matilda. August 8 – Emperor Henry VII begins a campaign against King Robert of Naples ("Robert the Wise").

Upon learning of the Henry's death, Louis, Duke of Bavaria goes to war against his cousin, Frederick the Fair, Duke of Austria and Styria, as both compete to be elected the new Emperor, a competition which will eventually be resolved in favour of Louis. September 23 – The English Parliament is called into session for the fourth time in less than 12 months, after three unsuccessful attempts to assemble members. King Edward II persuades the session to pass a tax bill for revenues to be collected by the following June in order to finance a new campaign against Scotland. October 21 – Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland delivers an ultimatum at a meeting of the Scottish nobles at an assembly in Dundee, giving Scots who have not yet come into his peace agreement a year to swear fealty to him or lose all their estates.
