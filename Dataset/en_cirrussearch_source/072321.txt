S/2003 J 10 is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard et al. in 2003. S/2003 J 10 is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 22,857,000 km in approximately 706 days, at an inclination of 163° to the ecliptic, in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.34. It belongs to the Carme group. This moon was considered lost until its recovery was announced on 12 October 2022.
