Matthew Stuart Cash (born 7 August 1997) is a professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Premier League club Aston Villa and the Poland national team. Cash started his career at Wycombe Wanderers and later the FAB Academy before he signed his first professional contract with Nottingham Forest and then established himself as a regular at right back. He signed for Aston Villa in September 2020. Born in England, Cash has Polish grandparents on his mother's side. He was confirmed a Polish citizen in October 2021, qualifying him to play for the Poland national team. He made his debut the following month, and represented the side at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Cash signed with Nottingham Forest in October 2014, after spending 16-months with the FAB Football Academy based at Bisham Abbey. Cash had joined FAB after Wycombe Wanderers released him, due to financial problems forcing their youth teams to be disbanded, aged fourteen. He experienced his first games in professional football on loan at League Two club Dagenham & Redbridge, having joined them on 4 March 2016 on a one-month loan deal. He scored his first goal for the Daggers in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Hartlepool United on 12 March 2016. On 5 August 2016, Cash signed a three-year deal with Forest to keep him at the club until 2019. He made his first team debut a day later, starting in a 4‚Äì3 win over Burton Albion. Cash's early season form earned him praise, with former Forest defender Kenny Burns claiming that the midfielder's performances were putting those of some of the more experienced Forest players "to shame". However, on only his fifth appearance for Forest, Cash sustained a fracture to his tibia at the beginning of a 2‚Äì2 draw away to Aston Villa on 11 September 2016 which was expected to keep him out for three months. Cash made his return from injury on 25 November as a 79th-minute substitute in a 5‚Äì2 defeat of Barnsley at Oakwell. Three days later Cash was linked with a ¬£5 million transfer to Premier League side Chelsea, although Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi subsequently took to social media to deny that the midfielder would be sold in the January transfer window. On 4 January 2017, Cash was the subject of a ¬£6 million bid from Bundesliga side RB Leipzig. Having remained at Forest upon the closure of the January transfer window, Cash signed a new contract on 3 March 2017 to extend his current deal with the club until 2021. Having changed squad number from 41 to 14, ankle ligament damage sustained during a pre-season friendly match with Girona deprived Cash of starting the first match of the 2017‚Äì18 season, with the injury reported to sideline the player for "around three months". He scored his first goal for Forest in a 5‚Äì2 win at Queens Park Rangers on 24 February 2018. Cash scored the opening goal for Nottingham Forest in the 2019‚Äì20 season, in a 2‚Äì1 defeat against West Bromwich Albion. During the season, Forest manager Sabri Lamouchi began to utilise Cash as a right back, after injuries to Tendayi Darikwa and later Carl Jenkinson. He made the right-back position his own, and his impressive performances led to the Poland national team reportedly monitoring his progress ahead of a potential call-up. He signed a three and a half year contract extension with Forest in November 2019. In January 2020, a number of clubs including Milan, Everton and West Ham were interested in signing Cash. However, Cash said that he wished to stay at Forest until the end of the season in the hope that he could help the team to secure promotion to the Premier League. He cited Aston Villa's Jack Grealish as an influence behind this decision. Cash was named Forest's Player of the Season by the club's supporters on 12 August 2020. On 3 September 2020, Aston Villa announced the signing of Cash on a five-year contract for a reported ¬£14¬†million, rising to ¬£16¬†million. Cash made his debut for the club on 21 September, in a 1‚Äì0 home victory against Sheffield United. On 18 September 2021, Cash scored his first goal for Aston Villa in a 3‚Äì0 Premier League victory over Everton. On 26 February 2022, Cash scored a long-range effort in an away victory over Brighton & Hove Albion which was nominated for Premier League Goal of the Month. He received a yellow card for his celebration of the goal, in which Cash lifted his shirt to reveal a message of support for Poland teammate Tomasz Kƒôdziora and his family, who were in Kyiv during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Cash was voted Villa's player of the month for March 2022. On 4 April 2022, Cash signed a five-year contract extension with Aston Villa, amidst reported interest from Atl√©tico Madrid. On 12 May 2022, at Aston Villa's End of Season awards, Cash was voted Villa's Player of the Season for the 2021‚Äì22 season. On 27 August 2023, Cash made his 100th appearance for Aston Villa, in which he scored two goals in the first 20 minutes to help his team to a 3‚Äì1 away win at Burnley. On 6 January 2024, he scored the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Middlesbrough in the FA Cup to give his side their first win in the competition since 2016. Cash is of Polish descent through his mother. In September 2021, Cash applied for a Polish passport. His application for confirmation of possession of Polish citizenship was signed on 26 October 2021 at the Masovian Voivodeship government building in Warsaw. On 1 November, Cash received his first call-up to the Poland national football team for their 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification matches against Andorra and Hungary. He made his first appearance in a 4‚Äì1 away victory against Andorra on 12 November. On 11 June 2022, Cash scored his first international goal in a 2‚Äì2 away UEFA Nations League draw against Netherlands. Cash is the son of former professional footballer Stuart Cash. His brother Adam coaches football at school-level. Cash grew up in Iver, Buckinghamshire, working in a branch of the department store Daniel prior to joining the Nottingham Forest academy.
