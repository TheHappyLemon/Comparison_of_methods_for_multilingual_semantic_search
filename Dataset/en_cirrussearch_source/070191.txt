The flag of Guyana, known as the Golden Arrowhead, has been the national flag of Guyana since May 1966, when the country became independent from the United Kingdom. It was designed by Whitney Smith, an American vexillologist (though originally without the black and white fimbriations, which were later additions suggested by the College of Arms in the United Kingdom). The proportions of the national flag are 3:5. The colours are symbolic: red for zeal and dynamism, gold for mineral wealth, green for agriculture and forests, black for endurance, white for rivers and water. The civil air ensign is a copy of the British Civil Air Ensign, with the Guyanese flag in the canton. The naval ensign of Guyana is a version of the national flag, with proportions of 1:2. As part of the British Empire, Guyana's flag was a Blue Ensign with the colonial badge in the fly. An unofficial red version was used at sea. The first flag was introduced in 1875 and was changed slightly in 1906 and 1955. Like all British Ensigns, the colonial flags of Guyana were all ratio 1:2. 1875–1906 Governor's flag, 1875–1906 1906–1919 1919–1955 Governor's flag, 1906–1955 1955–1966 Governor's flag, 1955–1966 Smith's proposed flag, 1962 The Presidential Standard of Guyana came into effect by Proclamation issued on 23 February 1970.
