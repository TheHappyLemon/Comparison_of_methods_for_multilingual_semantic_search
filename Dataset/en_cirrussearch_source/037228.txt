Miervaldis is a Latvian masculine given name, borne by some 600 men in Latvia. Miervaldis is one of the relatively few names still in modern use from among the very many Latvian names of indigenous origin either revived from their previous occurrence in the Middle Ages, or invented, during the first Latvian National Awakening in the late 19th century. The second element -valdis ("ruler") was a particular favourite and featured in a large number of names now rare or obsolete. The literal meaning of Miervaldis is "peace-ruler": mier from miers (peace) and the element -valdis as above. It is directly comparable to the Old East Slavic name Vladimir (but with the two elements reversed) and the Germanic name Friedrich.
