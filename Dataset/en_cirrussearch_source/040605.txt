The Latvian version first aired on 3 September 2017. To date, five seasons have been broadcast, as summarised below.   Team Reinis Sējāns   Team Aija Auškāpa   Team Intars Busulis   Team Marats Ogļezņevs In each season, each judge is allocated a category to mentor and chooses three acts to progress to the live finals.
