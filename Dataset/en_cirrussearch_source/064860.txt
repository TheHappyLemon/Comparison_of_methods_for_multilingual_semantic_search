Crepis paludosa, the marsh hawk's-beard, is a European species of flowering plant in the tribe Cichorieae of the family Asteraceae. It is widespread across much of Europe with isolated populations in Iceland, the Ural Mountains, and the Caucasus. This herbaceous perennial is found beside shady streams and in other damp shady places. The inflorescence is around 15–25 millimetres (0.6–1.0 in) in diameter. The upper leaves clasp the stem with pair of rounded basal lobes. It is a much more robust plant than smooth hawksbeard, Crepis capillaris, with which it is sometimes confused.[citation needed] The Flower heads are yellow and the flower buds are covered with black gland-hairs. Crepis paludosa is a component of Purple moor grass and rush pastures, a type of Biodiversity Action Plan habitat in the UK. It occurs on poorly drained neutral and acidic soils of the lowlands and upland fringe. It is found in the South West of England, especially in Devon.[citation needed] Figure 55 from Deutschlands Flora in Abbildungen; Author: Johann Georg Sturm; Painter: Jacob Sturm The Plant List, Crepis paludosa (L.)
