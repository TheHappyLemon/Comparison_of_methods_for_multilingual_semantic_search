The Vilayet of Angora (Ottoman Turkish: ولايت آنقره, romanized: Vilâyet-i Ankara) or Ankara was a first-level administrative division (vilayet) of the Ottoman Empire, centered on the city of Angora (Ankara) in north-central Anatolia, which included most of ancient Galatia. At the beginning of the 20th century it reportedly had an area of 32,339 square miles (83,760 km2), while the preliminary results of the first Ottoman census of 1885 (published in 1908) gave the population as 892,901. The accuracy of the population figures ranges from "approximate" to "merely conjectural" depending on the region from which they were gathered. As of 1920, the population was described as being mainly Muslim from Turkey, and Armenian Christians. It was an agricultural country, depending for its prosperity on its grain, wool and the mohair obtained from the Angora goats. An important industry was carpet-weaving at Kırşehir and Kayseri. There were mines of silver, copper, lignite and salt, and many hot springs, including some of great repute medicinally. Rock salt and fuller's earth was also mined in the area. Weaving was a popular industry in the vilayet but declined after the introduction of the railroad, where locals would export wool and mohair instead of weaving it. A small carpet industry was also found in the region in the early 20th century. Sanjaks of the Vilayet: Sanjak of Ankara (Ankara, Ayaş, Beypazarı, Sivrihisar, Çubuk, Nallıhan, Haymana, Kızılcahamam, Mihalıççık, Balâ, Kalecik) Sanjak of Bozok (Yozgat, Akdağmadeni, Boğazlıyan) Sanjak of Kayseri (Kayseri, Develi, İncesu) Sanjak of Kırsehir (Kırşehir, Mucur, Hacıbektaş, Keskin, Çiçekdağı, Avanos) Sanjak of Çorum (Çorum, Osmancık, Kargı, Sungurlu, İskilip) There was an Armenian village called Stanoz in proximity to Angora. Much of the Armenian population was lost after the Armenian genocide. By 2020 there was a cemetery remaining. Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). "Angora" . Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.).
