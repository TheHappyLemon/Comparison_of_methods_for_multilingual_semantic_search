The prime minister, literally the minister of state (French: Ministre d'État), is the head of government of Monaco, being appointed by and subordinate to the Prince of Monaco. During their term of office, the officeholder is responsible for directing the work of the government and in charge of foreign relations. As the monarch's representative, the prime minister also presides (with voting powers) over the Council of Government, directs the executive services and commands the police and military. Since 1 September 2020, Pierre Dartout has been the prime minister. The office was created in 1911 with the adoption of Monaco's constitution. Until the revision of the constitution of 2002, the prime minister had to be a French citizen,[citation needed] selected from several senior civil servants proposed by the French government. Since 2002, the prime minister can be either French or Monegasque and is chosen and appointed by the monarch, after consultation with the French government.
