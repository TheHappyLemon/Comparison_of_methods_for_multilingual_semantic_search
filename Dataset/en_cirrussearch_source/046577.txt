Narva Town Hall (Estonian: Narva raekoda) is a historic municipal building in the city of Narva, Estonia. The building is located on Town Hall Square (Raekoja plats) next to the Narva College of the University of Tartu. The town hall was one of the few elements of the city's baroque-era architecture to be rebuilt following the Second World War. It is now surrounded largely by Soviet-era Stalinist designs and Khrushchyovka. A â‚¬7 million renovation project at the Narva Town Hall was completed in 2023. The building has returned to its original function as the seat of Narva's city government and also accommodates a tourist information centre and restaurant. Tartu Town Hall ERR News.
