Bo Hamburger (born 24 May 1970 in Frederiksberg) is a Danish former professional road racing cyclist. He retired in 2006. After ending his career, Hamburger started a building company and a bike shop. He was the leading directeur sportif for Christina Watches–Onfone in 2013 and 2014. He was fired from Team CSC in 2001, after a positive EPO test. He was later cleared legally since the B test was below the limit, but still higher than normal. Since then, the Danish Cycle Union refused to let Hamburger represent Denmark. Hamburger fought the exclusion through legal means. In his book Den største pris – en cykelrytters bekendelser (The Greatest Cost – Confession of a Cyclist) released in Denmark on 7 November 2007, he admitted to using EPO and human growth hormone from 1995 to 1997. His name was also on the list of doping tests published by the French Senate on 24 July 2013 that were collected during the 1998 Tour de France and found positive for EPO when retested in 2004. 1991 5th Overall Tour of Sweden 1992 2nd Overall Tour of Sweden 4th Coppa Sabatini 8th Giro di Lombardia 8th Gran Piemonte 10th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 1993 2nd Overall Hofbrau Cup 3rd Overall Tour de l'Avenir 4th Coppa Placci 8th Grand Prix de Wallonie 8th Classique des Alpes 9th Brabantse Pijl 9th Druivenkoers-Overijse 1994 1st Stage 8 Tour de France 3rd Wincanton Classic 3rd Grand Prix Herning 4th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 5th Veenendaal–Veenendaal 8th Coppa Placci 9th Gran Piemonte 1995 2nd Overall Danmark Rundt 2nd Grand Prix Herning 5th Overall Volta a Catalunya 1996 2nd Road race, National Road Championships 2nd Grand Prix de Wallonie 6th Overall Volta a Catalunya 6th Overall Tour de Luxembourg 8th Overall Danmark Rundt 10th Classique des Alpes 1997 2nd Road race, UCI Road World Championships 4th Overall Grand Prix du Midi Libre 7th Overall Volta a Catalunya 1998 1st La Flèche Wallonne 1st Stage 2 Tour of the Basque Country 2nd Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 1st Stage 2 2nd Overall Tour Méditerranéen 2nd Road race, National Road Championships 3rd Overall Critérium International 4th Overall Danmark Rundt 4th GP de Fourmies 5th Amstel Gold Race 5th Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli 6th Classique des Alpes 9th Giro di Romagna Tour de France Held After Stage 4 1999 6th Overall Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 7th Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 2000 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st Stage 4 Paris–Nice 3rd Paris–Bourges 3rd GP de Fourmies 6th Overall Rheinland-Pfalz Rundfahrt 1st Stage 4 6th Tour du Haut Var 8th GP Ouest–France 9th Rund um den Flughafen Köln–Bonn 2001 6th Overall Giro della Liguria 2002 2nd GP Fred Mengoni 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 10th Coppa Ugo Agostoni 2003 2nd GP Industria & Commercio di Prato 2nd GP Fred Mengoni 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 6th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 7th Coppa Ugo Agostoni 8th Trofeo Città di Castelfidardo 9th Giro di Romagna 9th Trofeo Pantalica 10th Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli 2004 1st Stage 2 Giro della Liguria 2nd Giro delle Colline del Chianti 5th GP Industria & Commercio di Prato 6th Wachovia Invitational 2006 5th Trofeo Matteotti List of doping cases in cycling "Bo Hamburger: Jeg tog epo" (in Danish).
