Bartın is a city in northern Turkey, near the Black Sea. It is the seat of Bartın Province and Bartın District. Its population is 81,692 (2021). Formerly a district of Zonguldak Province, Bartın was made into a province seat in 1991. The city is situated 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) inland on the Bartın River (Bartın Çayı) that is navigable for vessels between the city and the Black Sea coast. Bartın River is the only navigable river for vessels in Turkey. The history of the antique Parthenios city (Παρθένιος in Greek), or Parthenia, dates back to 1200 BC, when its area was inhabited by the Kaskian tribe. In the following centuries, the region had entered under the dominance of Hittites, Phrygians, Cimmerians, Lydians, Greeks, and Persians. Later, it was part of the Roman Empire and then of the Byzantine Empire, until it fell to the Seljuk Turks and the Candaroğulları State between the 11th and the 13th centuries AD. Bartın was conquered by the Ottoman sultan Mehmet II in 1392. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Bartın was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. Bartın is a member of the Norwich-based European Association of Historic Towns and Regions (EAHTR). Main sights include the castle, two churches, bedesten, the Kuşkayası Road Monument and İnziva (seclusion) Cave in the city center. Sections of the ancient city like the forum, the council palace, the road of honor, the theatre, the acropolis, and a necropolis are now below the ground.
