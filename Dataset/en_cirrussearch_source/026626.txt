Bilbeis (Arabic: بلبيس  pronounced [belˈbeːs]; Bohairic Coptic: Ⲫⲉⲗⲃⲉⲥ/Ⲫⲉⲗⲃⲏⲥ Phelbes/Phelbēs) is an ancient fortress city on the eastern edge of the southern Nile Delta in Egypt, the site of the ancient city and former bishopric of Phelbes and a Latin Catholic titular see. The city is small in size but densely populated, with over 407,300 residents. It also houses the Egyptian Air Force Academy complex, which contains the town's largest public school in Al-Zafer. Coptic tradition says that Bilbeis was one of the stopping places of the Holy Family during the Flight into Egypt. The city was important enough in the Roman province of Augustamnica Secunda to become a bishopric.[citation needed] Situated on a caravan and natural invasion route from the east, Bilbeis was conquered in 640 by the Arabs. Amr ibn al-As besieged and took the city defended by a Byzantine general called al-Ardubun. According to a Muslim legend, Armanusa, the daughter of Muqawqis lived in Bilbeis. In 727 some of the Qays tribe were resettled here and later chain of fortresses was built to protect Cairo. The city played a role in the machinations for control of the Fatimid vizierate: first in 1164, when Shirkuh was besieged in the city by the combined forces of Shawar and crusader king Amalric I of Jerusalem for three months; then again in 1168 when the city was assaulted again by Amalric's army, who took the city after three days on 4 November and indiscriminately killed the inhabitants. (See Crusader invasion of Egypt.) In 1798, its fortifications were rebuilt at the order of Napoleon.[citation needed] Sadat Quraish Mosque The oldest mosque in Egypt, built in 640.
