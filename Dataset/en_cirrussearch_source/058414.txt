The Women's World Floorball Championship is an international floorball competition contested by the senior women's national teams of the members of the International Floorball Federation (IFF), the sport's global governing body. It is distinct from the Floorball World Championships, which is for men's teams. Originally played in May-June, the IFF decided in 2007 to move the tournament to early-December starting in 2008.
