Ventspils State Gymnasium No.1 (Latvian: Ventspils Valsts 1. ģimnāzija) is a secondary school located in Ventspils, Latvia. Ventspils Gymnasium No.1 was founded in December 9, 1918, thus being the first secondary school founded in independent Latvia. Over the years its name has been changed many times mostly because of the regime change in the country, for example, when Latvia was a part of the USSR it was named after Janis Fabricius, a military commander of the Red Army. In 1996 it received status of Gymnasium, meaning that it provides advanced secondary education. Since 2004 the school's building has been experiencing a lot of improvements. The Government of Latvia and Ventspils City Council invested more than one million euro to build a new sports hall, proving a new place for students to do sports. Subsequently, communication technology and natural science equipment was installed to accommodate the needs of increasing numbers of young graduates deciding to study IT and natural sciences in universities. For example, among graduates in 2012 almost 40% decided to pursue studies in one of these subjects.
