Grant was selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 4th round (118th overall) of the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. Grant was selected in the first round (first overall) of the 2005 QMJHL Entry Draft by the Saint John Sea Dogs, and played four seasons of major junior hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League with Saint John and the Shawinigan Cataractes. On June 24, 2013, the Pittsburgh Penguins traded Grant to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for winger Harry Zolnierczyk. He was re-signed to a one-year contract on July 10, 2013. Grant scored his first goal in his first NHL game, on November 30, 2013, against Antti Niemi of the San Jose Sharks. Despite scoring a goal in his second successive game with the Ducks, on December 12, 2013, he was reassigned to the Norfolk Admirals of the American Hockey League. Approaching the trade deadline on March 5, 2014, Grant was traded by the Ducks to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for minor league right winger Andre Petersson. On July 2, 2015, Grant signed a one-year, two-way contract as a free agent with the Arizona Coyotes. On July 4, 2016, Grant signed a one-year, two-way deal as a free agent with the Boston Bruins.
