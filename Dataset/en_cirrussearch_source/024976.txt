Lutuhyne (Ukrainian: Лутугине, Russian: Лутугино) is a city in the Luhansk Raion of Luhansk Oblast (region) of Eastern Ukraine, Donbas. The 2022 population was 17,061 (2022 estimate). From mid-April 2014 pro-Russian separatists captured several towns in Luhansk Oblast, including Lutuhyne. On 27 July 2014, Ukrainian forces claimed their troops had entered the city, and would restore Ukrainian control, yet by autumn it was clear that Lutuhyne was under the control of the pro-Russian, self-declared Lugansk People's Republic, and would remain that way from autumn 2014 on. Following the 2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine, Russia has claimed the settlement as their territory.
