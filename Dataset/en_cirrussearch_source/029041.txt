79 (seventy-nine) is the natural number following 78 and preceding 80. 79 is: An odd number. The smallest number that can not be represented as a sum of fewer than 19 fourth powers. The 22nd prime number (between 73 and 83) An isolated prime without a twin prime, as 77 and 81 are composite. The smallest prime number p for which the real quadratic field Q[√p] has class number greater than 1 (namely 3). A cousin prime with 83. An emirp in base 10, because the reverse of 79, 97, is also a prime. A Fortunate prime. A circular prime. A prime number that is also a Gaussian prime (since it is of the form 4n + 3). A happy prime. A Higgs prime. A lucky prime. A permutable prime, with ninety-seven. A Pillai prime, because 23! + 1 is divisible by 79, but 79 is not one more than a multiple of 23. A regular prime. A right-truncatable prime, because when the last digit (9) is removed, the remaining number (7) is still prime. A sexy prime (with 73). The n value of the Wagstaff prime 201487636602438195784363. Similarly to how the decimal expansion of 1/89 gives Fibonacci numbers, 1/79 gives Pell numbers, that is, 179=∑n=1∞P(n)×10−(n+1)=0.0126582278… .{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{79}}=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{P(n)\times 10^{-(n+1)}}=0.0126582278\dots \ .} A Leyland number of the second kind. The atomic number of the chemical element gold (Au) is 79. Messier object 79 (M79), a magnitude 8.5 globular cluster in the constellation Lepus New General Catalogue object 79 (NGC 79), a galaxy in the constellation Andromeda Live Seventy Nine, an album by Hawkwind The years 79 BC, AD 79 or 1979 The number of the French department Deux-Sèvres The ASCII code of the capital letter O Sloane, N. J. A.

The table lists fields by discriminant, which is 4p for Q[√p] when p is congruent to 3 modulo 4, as is the case for 79, so the entry appears at discriminant 316. "Sloane's A006567 : Emirps".
