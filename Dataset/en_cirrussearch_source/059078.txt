The Collège de France (French pronunciation: [kɔlɛʒ də fʁɑ̃s]), formerly known as the Collège Royal or as the Collège impérial founded in 1530 by François I, is a higher education and research establishment (grand établissement) in France. It is located in Paris near La Sorbonne. The Collège de France is considered to be France's most prestigious research establishment. Research and teaching are closely linked at the Collège de France, whose ambition is to teach "the knowledge that is being built up in all fields of literature, science and the arts". It offers high-level courses that are free, nondegree-granting and open to all without condition or registration. This gives it a special place in the French intellectual landscape. As of 2021, 21 Nobel Prize winners and 9 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with the Collège. It does not grant degrees. Each professor is required to give lectures where attendance is free and open to anyone. Professors, about 50 in number, are chosen by the professors themselves, from a variety of disciplines, in both science and the humanities. The motto of the Collège is Docet Omnia, Latin for "It teaches everything"; its goal is to "teach science in the making" and can be best summed up by Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phrase: "Not acquired truths, but the idea of freely-executed research" which is inscribed in golden letters above the main hall. It is an associate member of University PSL. The Collège has research laboratories and one of the best research libraries of Europe, with sections focusing on history with rare books, humanities, social sciences and also chemistry and physics. As of June 2009, over 650 audio podcasts of Collège de France lectures are available on iTunes. Some are also available in English and Chinese. Similarly, the Collège de France's website hosts several videos of classes. The classes are followed by various students, from senior researchers to PhD or master's students, or even undergraduates. Moreover, the "leçons inaugurales" (first lessons) are important events in Paris intellectual and social life and attract a very large public of curious Parisians. The Collège was established by King Francis I of France, modeled after the Collegium Trilingue in Louvain, at the urging of Guillaume Budé. Of humanist inspiration, the school was established as an alternative to the Sorbonne to promote such disciplines as Hebrew, Ancient Greek (the first teacher being the celebrated scholar Janus Lascaris) and Mathematics. Initially called Collège royal, and later Collège des trois langues (Latin, ancient Greek and Hebrew), Collège national, and Collège impérial, it was named Collège de France in 1870. In 2010, it became a founding associate of PSL Research University (a community of Parisian universities). 1800–1823: Louis Lefèvre‑Gineau 1824–1838: Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy 1838–1840: Louis Thénard 1840–1848: Jean-Antoine Letronne 1848–1852: Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire 1852–1853: Xavier de Portets [d] 1853–1854: Jacques Rinn [fr] 1854–1873: Stanislas Julien 1873–1883: Édouard René de Laboulaye 1883–1892: Ernest Renan 1892–1894: Gaston Boissier 1894–1903: Gaston Paris 1903–1911: Émile Levasseur 1911–1929: Maurice Croiset [fr; ru; de] 1929–1936: Joseph Bédier 1937–1955: Edmond Faral 1955–1965: Marcel Bataillon 1966–1974: Étienne Wolff 1974–1980: Alain Horeau [fr] 1980–1991: Yves Laporte [fr] 1991–1997: André Miquel 1997–2000: Gilbert Dagron 2000–2006: Jacques Glowinski 2006–2012: Pierre Corvol 2012–2015: Serge Haroche 2015–2019: Alain Prochiantz Since 2019: Thomas Römer The faculty of the Collège de France currently comprises fifty-two Professors, elected by the Professors themselves from among Francophone scholars in subjects including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, history, archaeology, linguistics, oriental studies, philosophy, the social sciences and other fields.
