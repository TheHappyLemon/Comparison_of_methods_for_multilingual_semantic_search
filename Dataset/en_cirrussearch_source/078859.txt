Psylloidea is a superfamily of true bugs, including the jumping plant lice and others which have recently been classified as distinct families. Though the group first appeared during the Early Jurassic, modern members of the group do not appear until the Eocene, and Mesozoic members of the order are usually assigned to the possibly paraphyletic family Liadopsyllidae. Aphalaridae Calophyidae Carsidaridae Homotomidae Liviidae Phacopteronidae Psyllidae Triozidae In addition, the following extinct families are recognised: †Liadopsyllidae †Malmopsyllidae †Neopsylloididae Pachypsylla celtidismamma, galls Pachypsylla celtidisumbilicus Phylloplecta tripunctata, nymphs on Rubus Wikimedia Commons has media related to Psylloidea.
