The Specials (French: Hors normes) is a 2019 French drama film directed by Éric Toledano and Olivier Nakache. It was screened out of competition at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. The film is inspired by the true story of Stéphane Benhamou and Daoud Tatou. Bruno (Vincent Cassel) runs an organization helping people with autism by finding job placements and activities for them outside of the confines of the institutionalized hospital setting, along with Malik (Reda Kateb), who certifies teenagers from Paris's rough neighborhoods to care for autistic patients. Bruno continually hires more staff despite his organization's financial problems. His organization is also under investigation by the social affairs inspector for operating without a license. Bruno gets Joseph, his oldest patient, a job at a washing machine manufacturer, but Joseph struggles with the temptation to pull fire alarms on metro trains during his commute. One of Malik's students, Dylan, works with a patient named Valentin. Dylan struggles with appreciating the value of the program and is disrespectful toward Malik, who is training them to receive certificates to work with autistic children.
