The 2022–23 UEFA Champions League was the 68th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 31st season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. The final was played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, on 10 June 2023. The stadium was originally appointed to host the 2020 UEFA Champions League final, but both this and the 2021 editions, which had been subsequently re-allocated to the Atatürk, were moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2023 final was contested by English club Manchester City and Italian club Inter Milan, with the former winning 1–0 via a second-half goal by Rodri, who was named man of the match by UEFA. For Manchester City, this was their first-ever European Cup, and first European trophy since 1970. Having earlier won the Premier league and FA Cup titles, they achieved a unique continental treble. As winners, Manchester City earned the right to play against Sevilla, the winners of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League, in the 2023 UEFA Super Cup, as well as qualifying for both the 2023 and 2025 FIFA Club World Cups in Saudi Arabia and the United States, respectively. Real Madrid were the defending champions, having won a record-extending fourteenth European Cup title in the previous edition, but they were eliminated by eventual champions Manchester City in the semi-finals. A total of 78 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Russia, who were banned from participating due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: Associations 1–4 each had four teams qualify. Associations 5–6 each had three teams qualify. Associations 7–15 (except Russia) each had two teams qualify. Associations 16–55 (except Liechtenstein) each had one team qualify. The winners of the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League and 2021–22 UEFA Europa League were each given an additional entry if they did not qualify for the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league. For the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2021 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2016–17 to 2020–21. Apart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below: (UEL) – Additional berth for UEFA Europa League title holders The following is the access list for this season. Due to the suspension of Russia for the 2022–23 European season, the following changes to the access list were made: The champions of association 11 (Scotland) enter the group stage instead of the play-off round (Champions Path). The champions of association 13 (Turkey) enter the play-off round instead of the third qualifying round (Champions Path). The champions of association 15 (Cyprus) enter the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round (Champions Path). The champions of associations 18 (Croatia) and 19 (Switzerland) enter the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round (Champions Path). The runners-up of associations 10 (Austria) and 11 (Scotland) enter the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round (League Path). Since the Champions League title holders (Real Madrid) qualified via their domestic league, the following changes to the access list were made: The champions of association 12 (Ukraine) enter the group stage instead of the play-off round (Champions Path). The champions of association 14 (Denmark) enter the play-off round instead of the third qualifying round (Champions Path). The champions of association 16 (Serbia) enter the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round (Champions Path). The champions of associations 20 (Greece) and 21 (Israel) enter the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round (Champions Path).

CC: 2022 UEFA club coefficients. Notes Liechtenstein (LIE): The seven teams affiliated with the Liechtenstein Football Association (LFV) all played in the Swiss football league system. The only competition organised by the LFV was the Liechtenstein Football Cup – the winners of which qualified for the UEFA Europa Conference League. Russia (RUS): On 28 February 2022, Russian football clubs and national teams were suspended from FIFA and UEFA competitions due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 2 May 2022, UEFA confirmed that Russian clubs would be excluded from the 2022–23 UEFA competitions. Ukraine (UKR): The 2021–22 Ukrainian Premier League was abandoned due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The top two teams of the league at the time of the abandonment (Shakhtar Donetsk and Dynamo Kyiv) were selected to play in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League by the Ukrainian Association of Football. The schedule of the competition was as follows. All matches were played on Tuesdays and Wednesdays apart from the preliminary round final and the final. Scheduled kick-off times starting from the play-off round were 18:45 and 21:00 CEST/CET. As the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place in Qatar between 20 November and 18 December 2022, the group stage commenced in the first week of September 2022 and concluded in the first week of November 2022 to make way for the World Cup. The draws for the qualifying round started at 12:00 CEST/CET and were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. The group stage draw took place in Istanbul, Turkey. A total of four teams played in the preliminary round. Seeding of teams was based on their 2022 UEFA club coefficients, with two seeded teams and two unseeded teams in the semi-finals. The matches took place at Víkingsvöllur in Reykjavík, Iceland so the first team drawn in each tie in the semi-finals, and also the final (between the two winners of the semi-finals, whose identity was not known at the time of draw), would be the "home" team for administrative purposes. The winner of the preliminary round final advanced to the first qualifying round. The losers of the semi-finals and final were transferred to the Europa Conference League Champions Path second qualifying round. The draw for the first qualifying round was held on 14 June 2022. The first legs were played on 5 and 6 July, and the second legs were played on 12 and 13 July 2022. The winners of the ties advanced to the Champions Path second qualifying round. The losers were transferred to the Europa Conference League Champions Path second qualifying round. Notes Losers drawn to receive a bye to the Europa Conference League third qualifying round. The draw for the second qualifying round was held on 15 June 2022. The first legs were played on 19 and 20 July, and the second legs were played on 26 and 27 July 2022. The winners of the ties advanced to the third qualifying round of their respective path. The Champions Path losers were transferred to the Europa League Champions Path third qualifying round, while the League Path losers were transferred to the Europa League Main Path third qualifying round. The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 18 July 2022. The first legs were played on 2 and 3 August, and the second legs were played on 9 August 2022.

The Champions Path losers were transferred to the Europa League play-off round, while the League Path losers were transferred to the Europa League group stage. The draw for the play-off round was held on 2 August 2022. The first legs were played on 16 and 17 August, and the second legs were played on 23 and 24 August 2022. The winners of the ties advanced to the group stage. The losers were transferred to the Europa League group stage. Salzburg Brugge Dinamo Plzeň Copenhagen Man. City Liverpool London PSG Marseille Bayern Dortmund Frankfurt Leverkusen Leipzig M. Haifa Milan Napoli Juventus Ajax Lisbon Porto Glasgow Barcelona Madrid Sevilla Shakhtar Glasgow teams Celtic Rangers Lisbon teams Benfica Sporting CP London teams Chelsea Tottenham Hotspur Madrid teams Atlético Madrid Real Madrid Milan teams Inter Milan Milan The draw for the group stage was held on 25 August 2022. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots, each of eight teams, based on the following principles: Pot 1 contained the Champions League and Europa League title holders, and the champions of the top six associations based on their 2021 UEFA country coefficients. Since the Champions League title holders, Real Madrid, were also the champions of Association 2 (Spain), the champions of Association 7 (Netherlands), Ajax, were seeded into Pot 1. Pots 2, 3 and 4 contained the remaining teams, seeded based on their 2022 UEFA club coefficients (CC). Teams from the same association could not be drawn into the same group. Eintracht Frankfurt made their debut appearance in the group stage (and first appearance in the European Cup since their loss in the 1960 final) after winning the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League and, as a result, this was the first time that five German clubs played in the group stage. A total of 15 national associations were represented in the group stage. This season was the first since the 1995–96 edition in which a Turkish side failed to qualify for the group stage. It was also the first time since the 2007–08 season that two Scottish sides qualified for the group stage. Source: UEFA Notes: Tied on head-to-head points.

In the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows: In the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight group runners-up were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other. In the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there were no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association could be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals were held together before the quarter-finals were played, the identity of the quarter-final winners was not known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw was also held to determine which semi-final winner was designated as the "home" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it was played at a neutral venue). The draw for the round of 16 was held on 7 November 2022, 12:00 CET. The first legs were played on 14, 15, 21 and 22 February, and the second legs were played on 7, 8, 14 and 15 March 2023. The draw for the quarter-finals was held on 17 March 2023, 12:00 CET. The first legs were played on 11 and 12 April, and the second legs were played on 18 and 19 April 2023. Notes Order of legs reversed after original draw. The draw for the semi-finals was held on 17 March 2023, 12:00 CET, after the quarter-final draw. The first legs were played on 9 and 10 May, and the second legs were played on 16 and 17 May 2023. The final was played on 10 June 2023 at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. A draw was held on 17 March 2023, after the quarter-final and semi-final draws, to determine the "home" team for administrative purposes. 10 June 2023 (2023-06-10) 22:00 TRT Atatürk Olympic Stadium, Istanbul Attendance: 71,412 Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland) Statistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.
