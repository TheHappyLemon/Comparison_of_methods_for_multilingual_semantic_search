Lamitan, officially the City of Lamitan (Chavacano: Ciudad de Lamitan; Yakan: Siyudad Lamitanin; Tausūg: Dāira sin Lamitan; Filipino: Lungsod ng Lamitan), is a 6th class component city and de jure capital of the province of Basilan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 100,150 people. The city is bounded on the east by the municipality of Tuburan, on the south by Tipo-Tipo, on the west by Isabela and on the north by Basilan Strait. In July 2016, the Basilan provincial government broke ground for the construction of the new provincial capitol inside the defunct 4,000-hectare (9,900-acre) University of the Philippines (UP) Land Grant in Barangay Santa Clara. In July 2022, Lamitan gained national attention when former mayor Rose Furigay, who had served as the city's mayor from 2013 to June 2022, was assassinated in a mass shooting at the Ateneo de Manila University where two others were killed. On June 18, 2007, voters in Lamitan ratified Republic Act No. 9393. 26,636 voted "yes," while only 177 voted against. The Supreme Court declared the cityhood law of Lamitan and 15 other cities unconstitutional after a petition filed by the League of Cities of the Philippines in its ruling on November 18, 2008. On December 22, 2009, the cityhood law of Lamitan and 15 other municipalities regain its status as cities again after the court reversed its ruling on November 18, 2008. On August 23, 2010, the court reinstated its ruling on November 18, 2008, causing Lamitan and 15 cities to become regular municipalities. Finally, on February 15, 2011, Lamitan becomes a city again including the 15 municipalities declaring that the conversion to cityhood met all legal requirements. After six years of legal battle, in its board resolution, the League of Cities of the Philippines acknowledged and recognized the cityhood of Lamitan and 15 other cities.
