Kurt Roland "Kurre" Hamrin (Swedish: [ˈkɵʈː hamˈriːn]; 19 November 1934 – 4 February 2024) was a Swedish professional footballer who played as a winger. He began his career in his home country with AIK, but later played for several Italian clubs, most notably Fiorentina, with whom he won two Coppa Italia titles, a Cup Winners' Cup, and a Mitropa Cup over nine years, making over 350 appearances for the club and scoring over 200 goals in all competitions. He also represented AC Milan, with whom he won a Serie A title and the European Cup. A prolific goalscorer, he is currently the eighth highest goalscorer of all time in Italy's Serie A, with 190 goals. In addition to his success at club level, Hamrin also had a successful international career, and was a member of the Sweden team that reached the 1958 FIFA World Cup final on home soil; he is commonly regarded as one of the greatest Swedish footballers of all time as well as one of Fiorentina's greatest players ever. Hamrin first played for AIK in Sweden, whom he joined in the 1952–53 season. He then joined Italian side Juventus in 1956 and played 23 games during his single season there, notching eight goals. After that one season, he joined Padova on loan, where he scored 20 goals in 30 games. He would only stay there for one season again, however, as he was sold to Fiorentina in 1958, where he stayed until 1967, playing 289 Serie A games and scoring 150 goals. While at Fiorentina, he won the Coppa Italia in 1961 and 1966, as well as the 1960–61 European Cup Winners' Cup (finishing the competition as the top-scorer with six goals, including one in the second leg of the final, a 2–1 home victory over Rangers), and the 1966 Mitropa Cup. Hamrin is commonly regarded as one of Fiorentina's greatest ever players, and is the team's all-time highest goalscorer, with 208 goals. He joined AC Milan in 1967 and played there for two seasons, winning the league title in 1968; he also scored both goals for Milan as they overcame Hamburg 2–0 in the 1968 European Cup Winners' Cup final. The following season, the team won the European Cup. His final Italian club was Napoli, whom he joined from Milan in 1969. In 1971, he return to Sweden, playing one season for IFK Stockholm before retiring in 1972. Hamrin played 32 times for Sweden between 1953 and 1965, scoring 17 goals. Most Swedes remember him best for the goal he scored against West Germany in the semi-finals of the 1958 FIFA World Cup on home soil. The goal allowed Sweden to win the match 3–1, and secure a place in the final against Brazil, where they were defeated 5–2. After his retirement as a footballer, Hamrin moved to Florence with his family. He also worked as scout for AC Milan from 1998 to 2008. Hamrin died on 4 February 2024, at the age of 89. He was the last surviving player from either the Swedish and Brazilian sides who participated in the 1958 World Cup final. Hamrin was a fast, creative, elegant, and technically skilled right winger, who was gifted with outstanding pace, as well as good vision, and opportunism in front of goal. A direct and efficient two-footed player, he was known in particular for his flair, as well as his incredible dribbling and striking ability with either foot, and stood out for his ability to utilise his speed to get past his opponents; he was also capable of beating players in one-on-one situations with elaborate moves and feints, such as the nutmeg. Moreover, he was a highly prolific goalscorer. Despite his playing ability, however, he was also known to be injury-prone.
