This is a list of heads of state of Mali since the country gained independence from France in 1960 to the present day. A total of seven people have served as head of state of Mali (excluding three acting presidents). Additionally, two people, Amadou Toumani Touré and Assimi Goïta, have served on two non-consecutive occasions. The current head of state of Mali is interim president Assimi Goïta, who took power for a second time on 24 May 2021, after dismissing previous interim president Bah Ndaw in the 2021 coup d'état. He has since been constitutionally declared interim president of Mali. Since the 2023 constitutional referendum held during Goita's leadership, Mali has shifted from a semi-presidential to a full presidential system, with the president serving as the head of government and dictating the policies of the government. As of 2021, there is a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of Mali. The term limit has not been met by any president yet. Article 53 of the Constitution entrusts the Prime Minister with the duties of the presidency during temporary absences. In the case of a definitive vacancy due to resignation, death, or permanent incapacitation, the President of the National Assembly assumes the functions of the president for a period of 90 to 120 days until a new president can be elected. 1960–1965: Head of State 1965–1968: President of the Republic 1968–1969: Chairman of the Military Committee for National Liberation 1969–1979: Head of State 1979–1991: President of the Republic 1991          : Chairman of the National Reconciliation Council 1991–1992: Chairman of the Transitional Committee for the Salvation of the People 1992–2012: President of the Republic 2012          : Chairman of the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State 2012–2020: President of the Republic 2020          : Chairman of the National Committee for the Salvation of the People 2020–present: President of the Transition Political parties   Sudanese Union – African Democratic Rally (US–RDA)   Democratic Union of the Malian People (UDPM)   Alliance for Democracy in Mali – Pan-African Party for Liberty, Solidarity and Justice (ADEMA–PASJ)   Rally for Mali (RPM) Other factions   Military   Independent Status   Acting President Politics of Mali Vice President of Mali First Lady of Mali List of prime ministers of Mali List of colonial governors of Mali Simultaneously served as the President of the National Assembly.
