A-Europa, also known as A-Eiropa, is a Europop band from Latvia. The name A-Eiropa originally stood for "Austrumeiropa" which means "Eastern Europe" in Latvian.[citation needed] A quite unusual[citation needed] cultural phenomenon is the fact that the group most often releases two versions of songs - one in Latvian and another in Russian (same music, different verses) - or mixes both languages in the same song. The originator and voice of the group is Artūrs Duboks, who lives in the city of Daugavpils[citation needed] in Latvia. The group has several times ranked in the top of the hits list for national radio stations and abroad.[citation needed] A-Eiropa's hits have included "Baltās rozes"/"Белые розы" (White roses), "Jūrmala"/"Юрмала" (Jūrmala) and others.
