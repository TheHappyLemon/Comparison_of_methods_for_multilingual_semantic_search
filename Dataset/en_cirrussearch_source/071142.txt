Cynthia Ann Howell (July 16, 1980 – c. January 24, 2024), known professionally as Jesse Jane, was an American pornographic film actress. She entered the industry in the early 2000s, and later transitioned into mainstream film and television roles. Jane was an exclusive contract performer for Digital Playground between 2002 and 2014, starring in the Pirates series of pornographic films. She retired from the adult film industry in 2017 after a career spanning nearly two decades. She was a member of the NightMoves Hall of Fame, XRCO Hall of Fame, and the AVN Hall of Fame.

She later made the decision to transition into a full-time career as a Hawaiian Tropic bikini model. Jane signed an exclusive contract with the adult film production company Digital Playground between 2002 and 2014. She avoided the "shock value" trend prevalent in mid-2000s pornography, according to The New York Times. Jane portrayed the first officer of a ship on a mission against a group of evil pirates in Pirates (2005), later reprising her role in the sequel, Pirates II: Stagnetti's Revenge (2008). The films, which, respectively, cost $1 million and $8 million to produce, were among the highest-budget pornographic films ever made.
