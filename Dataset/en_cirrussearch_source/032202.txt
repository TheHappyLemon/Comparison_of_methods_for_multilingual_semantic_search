He was a member of the jury at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival and the 45th Berlin International Film Festival in 1995. As a cameraman, I deal with the atmosphere, but the reason for this is always the plot, the drama [...] These concepts cannot be opposed, cannot be separated, since one simply does not exist without the other.
