At the 1900 Summer Olympics, an association football tournament was contested for the first time. Only two matches were held between the three club sides, and no medals were awarded. France's representatives were determined by the USFSA, which elected the Parisian champion Club Français. For Belgium, after Racing Club de Bruxelles declined to participate, a student selection with players from the Université libre de Bruxelles was sent by the Federation. The team was reinforced with a few non-students. On the other hand, English club Upton Park F.C. represented Great Britain. The International Olympic Committee credits Great Britain, France and a "Mixed Team" with gold, silver and bronze medals, respectively, as part of its attempt to reconcile early Olympic Games with the modern award scheme. The Belgian team included one British and one Dutch player. The football matches were held at the Vélodrome de Vincennes in Paris. Originally there were four matches scheduled for the 1900 Olympics, all including a French team. As Switzerland and Germany eventually did not send a team, the match involving France and England was moved forward to 20 September. 16 September 1900  France vs   Switzerland 23 September 1900  France vs  Belgium 30 September 1900  France vs  Germany 7 October 1900  France vs  England The match final schedule of the tournament.
