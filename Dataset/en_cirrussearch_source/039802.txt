In the painting Woman with the artist, he skillfully creates shading, a sophisticated harmony of colors, and the relaxed atmosphere in the room. The work exudes decorative flair, loss of viability, smooth contours of objects, and a fondness for bright, warm colors. His works re-create daily life, balanced between fantasy and reality. The theme of the woman is one of the most delicate topics that reflected in all his work. Woman with the Artist, Vytautas Kasiulis. europeana.eu, 12 май 2016 г.
