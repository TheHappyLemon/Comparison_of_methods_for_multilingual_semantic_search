Christoph Bertschy (born 5 April 1994) is a Swiss professional ice hockey center currently playing for HC Fribourg-Gottéron of the National League (NL). He was drafted 158th overall by the Minnesota Wild in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. Bertschy previously played professionally with SC Bern of Switzerland's National League A. On 26 April 2015, Bertschy was signed to a three-year entry-level contract with the Minnesota Wild. With his development stalling within the Wild organization, on 8 February 2018, he was traded alongside Mario Lucia to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for Viktor Lööv. He was immediately reassigned to continue with the Binghamton Devils of the AHL. On 27 April 2018, as a pending restricted free agent with the Devils and unable to cement a role in the NHL, Bertschy opted to return to Switzerland by signing a four-year contract with Lausanne HC of the National League.
