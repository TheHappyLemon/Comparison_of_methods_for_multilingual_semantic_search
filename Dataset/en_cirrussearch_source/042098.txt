Şah Sultan (Ottoman Turkish: شاه سلطان; died 1572) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Selim I and one of his concubines. She was the half-sister of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. She married Lütfi Pasha in around 1523. He was a historian, and author, and entered the palace through the child levy. After 1512, he served as the sancak governor in Anatolian and Balkan provinces, actively participating in the initial siege of Vienna in 1529. His career continued to ascend as he received promotions, overseeing the beylerbeyliks of Karaman, Anatolia, and Rumelia from 1533 onwards. By 1536-37, Lütfi Pasha had become a vizier, ultimately reaching the zenith of his career in 1539 when he assumed the prestigious role of grand vizier. The two together had a daughter named Esmahan Sultan, who married a certain Hüseyin Pasha, and had two daughters, Neslihan Sultan (died 1556) and Vasfihan Sultan (died 1570). In 1541, she initiated a divorce from Lütfi Pasha, due to his involvement in a disturbing incident concerning the cruel treatment of a prostitute, which involved the mutilation of her genitals as punishment. Historian Mustafa Ali's account highlights that when Şah objected, Lütfi insisted on persisting with such punishments for prostitutes and resorted to physically assaulting the princess when she expressed her displeasure. Responding to Şah's plea, Suleiman granted her the divorce she sought and relieved Lütfi Pasha of his position as grand vizier, effectively concluding his official career. Opting not to remarry, Şah chose to return to the royal palace, adhering to the customary residence for a princess following the dissolution of her marriage. In 1555, she endowed a tekke in Eyüp, followed in 1556, by a mosque in her name also in Eyüp. In 1564, she endowed a school in Fatih. She died in 1572 and was buried in her own mausoleum, inside her mosque in Eyüp. Buried beside her are her mother, her daughter, Esmahan, and granddaughters, Neslihan and Vasfihan. In the 2003 TV miniseries Hürrem Sultan, Şah Sultan is portrayed by Turkish actress Yeliz Doğramacılar. In the 2011 TV series Muhteşem Yüzyıl, Şah Sultan is played by Turkish actress Deniz Çakır.
