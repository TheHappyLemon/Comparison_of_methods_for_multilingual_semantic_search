Kikut Lighthouse (German: Kieckturm) is a lighthouse in the north of Poland on the Baltic Sea coast that is active since 1962. It is the highest light on Poland's coast. The lighthouse is situated near the village Wisełka on the island of Wolin and can only be reached via footpaths, steep at the end. The lighthouse was built on the base of an ancient view tower, the Kiekturm. It is one of the few Polish lighthouses, which can't be visited. Its light is visible from the neighbouring island of Usedom. The former lighthouse was built in 1826. This lighthouse was originally a 19th-century stone lookout tower. An upper level brick and a lantern were added and it was converted into a lighthouse in 1962. The lighthouse is located in Wolin National Park.
