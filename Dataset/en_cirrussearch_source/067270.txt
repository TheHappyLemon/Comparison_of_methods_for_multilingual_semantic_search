Mick Schumacher (German pronunciation: [ˈmɪk ˈʃuːmaxɐ]; born 22 March 1999) is a Swiss-born German racing driver who is the reserve driver for the Mercedes AMG Formula One Team and McLaren, set to compete in the 2024 FIA World Endurance Championship with Alpine in the Hypercar category. Schumacher, raised in Gland, Switzerland, began his career in karting in 2008, progressing to the German ADAC Formula 4 by 2015. He initially used the pseudonym 'Mick Betsch' to avoid the spotlight due to the fame of his father, Michael Schumacher. After winning the 2018 FIA F3 European Championship, he progressed to Formula 2 in 2019, and won the 2020 Formula 2 Championship, with Prema Racing. His progression into Formula One saw him join the Ferrari Driver Academy in 2019, testing for Ferrari and Alfa Romeo before making his practice debut in the 2020 season. Schumacher competed in Formula One for Haas F1 Team in the 2021 and 2022 seasons. In 2023, he took on a new role as a reserve driver for both Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team and McLaren F1 Team. Mick Schumacher joined Alpine's World Endurance Hypercar team for the 2024 season. He is the son of seven-time Formula One World Champion Michael Schumacher, nephew of Ralf Schumacher and cousin of David Schumacher, all racing drivers. Schumacher was born in Vufflens-le-Château, and grew up in Gland. He is the son of seven-time Formula One World Champion Michael Schumacher and Western riding European Champion Corinna Schumacher. His uncle Ralf Schumacher is also a retired racing driver and former Formula One driver. His cousin David Schumacher is a racing driver as well. Schumacher is named after five-time 500cc motorcycle World Champion Mick Doohan. Schumacher was skiing with his father when Michael suffered life-threatening brain injuries on 29 December 2013. In March 2017, Mick first talked publicly about his father, describing him as "my idol" and "my role model". Before the start of the 2017 Belgian Grand Prix, he drove his father's championship-winning Benetton B194. He drove another of his father's championship winning cars, the Ferrari F2004, in a demonstration before the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix at Mugello, to mark Scuderia Ferrari's 1000th Formula One race, wearing his father's helmet for the occasion. Schumacher credits chess as being an integral part of his mental preparation before a Formula One race. He stated: “I feel like these games kind of bring focus back, as you always have to be switched on with your mind. In a weekend, I always want to be mentally ready for every challenge that comes.” Schumacher started his motorsport career in 2008. To avoid attention because of his famous father, he started his career under the pseudonym 'Mick Betsch', using his mother's maiden name. In 2011 and 2012, Schumacher drove in the KF3 class in the ADAC Kart Masters, ending in 9th and 7th respectively. In 2011 he finished 3rd in the Euro Wintercup in the KF3 class, repeating his success the following year. In 2013 he continued his starts in the junior class, which got reneamed to the KF-Junior. He finished 3rd in the German Championship and the CIK-FIA International Super Cup. In 2014, Schumacher used the name 'Mick Junior' and continued his starts in the KF-Junior class. He finished 2nd in the German Championship as well as in the European and World Championships. Although he did not race under his real surname, his successes in karting were picked up by the international press. At the end of 2014, he completed test drives for Jenzer Motorsport in a Formula 4 racing car. In 2015, Schumacher started racing in formula classes for the first time, racing for Van Amersfoort Racing in the ADAC Formula 4, using the Schumacher name. In 2016, Schumacher remained in ADAC Formula 4 but switched to Prema Powerteam, a team known for its close links to the Ferrari Driver Academy. He also entered the Italian F4 Championship and finished runner-up in both championships to Joey Mawson and Marcos Siebert respectively. In November 2016, Schumacher made his first appearance in Formula 3 machinery by taking part in the MRF Challenge, a championship based in India. He competed in the upper Formula 2000 class and finished the series in 3rd place, collecting four wins, nine podiums, and two pole positions. Schumacher finished behind Harrison Newey and Joey Mawson, but ahead of his future Formula 3 and Formula 2 competitors Jüri Vips and Felipe Drugovich. In April 2017, Schumacher made his debut in the FIA Formula 3 European Championship with Prema Powerteam. He finished the season in 12th place, his best finish being a 3rd place at Monza. Schumacher was the lowest finisher of the four Prema drivers, however, he was the third-best-placed rookie in the championship. Schumacher continued driving for Prema in the 2018 championship. He suffered a slow start to the season, eventually taking his first win at the 15th race of the year at Spa-Francorchamps, almost halfway through the season. Before this race, he sat in 10th place in the championship, 67 points behind championship leader Dan Ticktum. However, Schumacher dominated the latter half of the season, taking seven more wins, including five consecutively. He ended the season as champion, 57 points clear of 2nd-placed Ticktum, taking eight wins, fourteen total podium finishes, seven pole positions, and four fastest laps. Schumacher moved up to the FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2019 with Prema Racing, alongside Sean Gelael. At the first round of the season in Bahrain, Schumacher started 10th and finished 8th after passing Nobuharu Matsushita on the final lap, giving him reverse-grid pole position for the sprint race, in which he finished sixth. Schumacher started from 7th in the feature race at Baku but was forced into retirement after a spin. He recovered from 19th to finish 5th in the sprint race. He failed to score points at Barcelona, suffering a collision in the first race and a time penalty for an illegal overtake on Jack Aitken in the second. At Monaco, Schumacher collided with multiple cars in the feature race, bringing out the red flag. He would fail to score points in either race. A double retirement came at the Circuit Paul Ricard, after he was involved in a collision with teammate Gelael in the first race and suffered a puncture in the second. Schumacher stalled on the grid at the Red Bull Ring and finished in 18th place before a charge through the field in the sprint race saw him finish 4th. Another sprint race points-finish came at Silverstone with sixth place. He finished 8th at the feature race in Hungary, taking reverse-grid pole for the sprint race and holding the position to take his first win in Formula 2. Schumacher qualified sixth at Spa-Francorchamps, but both races were cancelled due to an accident that caused the death of Anthoine Hubert. At Monza, he retired from the feature race from a power issue but recovered to finish sixth in the sprint race, also achieving the fastest lap. He retired from both races in Russia, after an engine issue in the first and a collision with Giuliano Alesi in the second. Schumacher finished the season with 9th and 11th-place finishes in Abu Dhabi. He ended the season in 12th place in the championship with 53 points, considerably ahead of teammate Gelael, and took one win and one fastest lap. Schumacher continued with Prema in the 2020 FIA Formula 2 Championship, joined by reigning FIA Formula 3 champion and fellow Ferrari Driver Academy member Robert Shwartzman. In the feature race at Austria, he went off while battling Callum Ilott for the race lead. In the second round at the same circuit, his fire extinguisher went off in the sprint race. In Hungary, Schumacher bounced back with a double podium. He then went on a run of 5 consecutive podiums from Spain to Monza, including a win in the Feature race at Monza, and took the Championship lead at Mugello. He won the feature race at the next round in Russia and came third in the sprint race which was shortened due to a crash between Luca Ghiotto and Jack Aitken. At the Bahrain Round, he qualified in 10th and rose to fourth in the Feature race. He finished seventh in the Sprint race. As a result, Callum Ilott was able to bring the deficit down to 14 points going into the final round on the Outer Track at the same venue. In Sakhir, Schumacher qualified a career-worst 18th following an incident with Roy Nissany. He produced a good recovery drive up to sixth with the fastest lap. This meant that the points gap stayed the same going into the final race. In the Sprint race, Schumacher flat-spotted his tyres while fighting for the lead, which led to him defending from Ilott for the first half of the race. After a few more lock-ups, he pitted for softs, dropping him out of the points. As a result of hard attacking and defending, Ilott's tires didn't fare much better and he too slowly fell out of the points. This result confirmed Schumacher as the 2020 FIA Formula 2 Champion. Schumacher joined the Ferrari Driver Academy in January 2019, citing Ferrari's ties with his family as a significant reason for joining. In April 2019, he made his debut behind the wheel of a modern Formula One car, piloting the Ferrari SF90 during the first day of in-season testing at Bahrain International Circuit. He completed 56 laps during the test. He commented that being with Ferrari "felt like home" and that he was impressed by the braking power of the SF90. He continued in-season testing for Alfa Romeo Racing the following day. Schumacher was due to make his Formula One practice debut at the 2020 Eifel Grand Prix in the first practice session, driving for Alfa Romeo in place of Antonio Giovinazzi. Due to bad weather conditions, the session was cancelled and he performed no running. Schumacher instead made his practice debut at the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, driving for Haas in place of Kevin Magnussen. He later made an appearance for Haas at the post-season young drivers' test. Ahead of the 2021 season, Schumacher requested to use the ‘MSC’ abbreviation for his name, shown on TV coverage. MSC was the abbreviation used by his father Michael, to distinguish between Michael and his brother Ralf, whose time in Formula One coincided. Schumacher had previously raced under the ‘SCH’ abbreviation in Formula 2. Schumacher drove for the Haas team in 2021 after signing a multi-year contract, alongside Nikita Mazepin, with whom he raced in go-karts. He chose to race with the number 47 as his two favourite numbers, 4 and 7, were already in use by Lando Norris and Kimi Räikkönen respectively. Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto said that he expected Schumacher to have a "very difficult" first season, but added that he believed he could drive for Ferrari as early as 2023. Schumacher qualified nineteenth for his debut race, the Bahrain Grand Prix, ahead of teammate Mazepin. He spun on the first lap but was able to continue, eventually finishing last of the remaining drivers in sixteenth place. At the next race, the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, he crashed in front of the pit lane exit during a safety car period, breaking off his front wing, and went on to finish sixteenth. He crashed heavily in practice for the Monaco Grand Prix and the team was unable to repair his car in time for qualifying. He performed one of the only on-track overtakes of the Grand Prix, passing Mazepin at the Grand Hotel Hairpin on the opening lap. At the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, he overtook Mazepin shortly before the finish line, beating him by 0.074 seconds to claim thirteenth place. Schumacher caused qualifying at the French Grand Prix to be red-flagged after crashing, although this secured him fifteenth place on the grid and marked his first appearance in the second segment of qualifying (Q2). He crashed in the final practice session for the Hungarian Grand Prix and was forced to miss qualifying as his car was not repaired in time. He avoided the collisions on the opening lap and was classified twelfth in the race, later commenting that he was proud of his performance after having on-track battles with Max Verstappen. His first retirement of the season came at the Russian Grand Prix with an oil leak. At the Turkish Grand Prix, Schumacher reached Q2 and qualified fourteenth, the highest qualifying position of his Formula One career at this point. He and Fernando Alonso collided on the opening lap, causing Schumacher to spin and eventually finish nineteenth. Alonso later apologised for his role in the incident. He started the Mexico City Grand Prix fourteenth on the grid but was eliminated at the first corner after a collision with Esteban Ocon. At the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, his race ended on lap eight after crashing into a barrier, causing the race to be red-flagged. Schumacher ended his debut season nineteenth in the drivers' championship, ahead of teammate Mazepin but with no points scored. He continued testing for Ferrari during the season, completing test sessions in the SF71H at Fiorano Circuit. Schumacher remained with Haas for the 2022 season, partnering Kevin Magnussen. He also served as a reserve driver for Ferrari during the season, sharing duties with Antonio Giovinazzi. Schumacher qualified twelfth and finished eleventh at the season opening Bahrain Grand Prix, gaining positions due to the retirements of both Red Bulls and Pierre Gasly and achieving his best Formula One race result thus far. Schumacher missed the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after a high-impact crash in qualifying. He was transferred to hospital for precautionary checks and was released with no injuries. He made his racing return for the Australian Grand Prix, starting fifteenth and finishing thirteenth. Schumacher was running in the top ten with three laps remaining of the Miami Grand Prix, but collided with Sebastian Vettel during an overtake attempt and dropped to fifteenth. He reached the third qualifying session (Q3) for the first time in Formula One at the Spanish Grand Prix but finished the race outside the points. He had a heavy crash that split his car in half at the Monaco Grand Prix, causing the race to be red-flagged. Schumacher improved his best qualifying position at the Canadian Grand Prix, starting sixth. He was running in seventh place until an engine failure ended his race. At the following race, the British Grand Prix, he started nineteenth and recovered to eighth to score his first Formula One points. A week later at the Austrian Grand Prix, Schumacher qualified seventh and finished sixth; his best Formula One result, promoting him to fifteenth place in the drivers' championship at the halfway point of the 2022 season. He reached Q3 again at the Dutch Grand Prix but finished outside the points. Ahead of the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Haas announced that they would part ways with Schumacher following the 2022 season. He was replaced by Nico Hülkenberg. In December 2022, Ferrari announced that they would be ending their collaboration with Schumacher after four years, Schumacher having joined the driver academy back in 2019. The same day Mercedes-AMG F1 officially confirmed Schumacher would take on the role of reserve driver for 2023, following his departure from Haas. Team principal Toto Wolff said: “Mick is a talented young driver and we’re delighted to have him join the team. He is a hard worker, has a calm and methodical approach and is still hungry to learn and improve as a driver. These are all important qualities, and we’re excited for him to help us develop the W14. We also know that with two years of experience racing in Formula 1 under his belt, he will be ready to step into the car at short notice to replace either Lewis Hamilton or George Russell, should that need arise." Further, he became a reserve driver alongside Álex Palou for McLaren, which has an agreement with Mercedes, as a result of their engine contract, to share Mercedes' reserves, meaning he would also be available in 2023 to substitute for Lando Norris or Oscar Piastri if required. On 7 June, Schumacher drove the Mercedes W14 for a Pirelli tyre test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. On 5 July, he drove the McLaren MCL35M in testing at Portimao. On 22 November 2023, it was announced that Schumacher would join Alpine's World Endurance Hypercar team for the 2024 season. His teammates will be Nicolas Lapierre, Ferdinand Habsburg, Paul-Loup Chatin, Matthieu Vaxivière and Charles Milesi. * Season still in progress.
