Cabella signed a three-year professional contract with Montpellier in July 2009. He injured the cruciate ligament in his right knee during training in September and was ruled out for the season. He was sent on loan to Arles-Avignon for the 2010–11 Ligue 1 season, where he scored three goals in 17 league appearances.[citation needed] Cabella signed a two-year extension to his contract in January 2012, which would keep him at the club til 2016. In a 1–0 win over Brest on 4 February 2012, Cabella struck a volley from a cross that struck the back of his teammate Geoffrey Dernis and went into the opposition's net for a goal. Cabella was credited with the assist. On 11 February 2012, in a 3–0 victory over AC Ajaccio, Cabella scored with a right-footed shot across Ajaccio's goalkeeper after being put away by Olivier Giroud. On 20 May 2012, Montpellier won the league title for the first time in its history.[citation needed] In May 2014, Cabella announced his intention to leave the club in the summer. On 13 July 2014, Cabella signed for Premier League club Newcastle United on a six-year contract, for a reported £8 million transfer fee. He made his competitive debut on 17 August as Newcastle began the season with a 2–0 defeat at home to Manchester City, playing the full 90 minutes. Cabella's only Newcastle goal came on 31 January 2015, opening a 3–0 win away at Hull City. He was subsequently awarded Player of the Month for January by Newcastle fans. During his time with Newcastle, Cabella made 34 appearances in all competitions, scoring just one goal. On 19 August 2015, Cabella returned to France, signing with Ligue 1 side Marseille on a season-long loan as part of a deal that saw Florian Thauvin transfer to Newcastle. He made his club debut on four days later, starting in the 6–0 Ligue 1 home victory over Troyes. he scored his first goal for Marseille on 3 December in a 1–0 win over Rennes, and another goal three days later in a 2–2 draw with his former team Montpellier. Although Cabella's loan spell at Marseille had ended, he spent the pre-season with the French club, appearing in some friendly matches. On 11 August 2016, Newcastle announced that Cabella's loan switch to Marseille had become permanent ahead of the 2016–17 season. On 1 March 2017, he scored two goals to level the score twice (to 2–2 and 3–3) in a 4–3 extra-time home loss to Monaco in a 2016–17 Coupe de France round of 16 match.

On 16 August 2018, Cabella joined Saint-Étienne permanently on a four-year contract. The following 5 May, he scored a goal and provided two assists in the 3–2 away win over Monaco, reaching 50 Ligue 1 goals. On 25 July 2019, Cabella joined Russian club FC Krasnodar for a fee of €12 million. He made his debut on 3 August in a 1–1 draw at FC Zenit St Peterburg, being substituted for Magomed-Shapi Suleymanov after 58 minutes. On 21 August 2019, in the first leg Champions League qualifier against Olympiacos, he suffered an ACL rupture. Cabella missed almost a year during recovery, making his return appearance for Krasnodar on 1 July 2020 in a match against FC Rostov. The 2019–20 Russian Premier League season had been extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia. Cabella scored twice in Krasnodar's first league game of the season, a 3–0 victory at FC Ufa on 9 August 2020. In September, Cabella scored in each leg of Krasnodar's play-off round 4–2 aggregate win against PAOK for qualification to the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. It was the first time ever that the club had qualified for the group stage of Europe's premier knock-out competition. Cabella missed the first group stage match of the competition away to Rennes on 20 October as he was forced to self-isolate following a positive COVID-19 test. He scored his side's goal in their 1–1 draw away to group winners Chelsea in the final match of the group stage, having already been parachuted to the Europa League Round of 32. On 3 March 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Krasnodar announced that Cabella's contract was suspended and he will not train with the team, but it was not terminated and remained valid. Six days later, it was terminated by mutual consent. On 6 April 2022, Cabella returned to Montpellier until the end of the season. On 10 July, Lille announced his arrival on a free transfer, on a one-year contract, with an option to extend for another year. Between 2010 and 2012, Cabella played seventeen times for the France national under-21 football team, scoring four goals.[citation needed] As well as the French national side, Cabella also qualified for the non-FIFA affiliated team of Corsica.
