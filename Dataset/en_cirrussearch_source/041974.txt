Bleona began singing at age 5 when she joined the House of Pionieri and performed her first solo concert at age 9 for the Albanian Secret Service, where her father worked. At 13, her parents encouraged her to focus on academics and give up on singing, but against their advice, she continued to pursue a career in entertainment. When she was 14 years old, Bleona earned an audition and landed her first major role as the lead singer for the Skampa Theater in Elbasan.[citation needed] Following a performance at the Albanian National Music Festival at age 15, Bleona became a household name in her native country. She released her first single, "Lermeni (Let Me Be Free)" and a year later released her first album, Kam Qejfin Tim (I Run My Own Game). Bleona's first major tour took place that year, and she performed 25 summer shows at concert halls in Switzerland and Germany. Bleona speaks and sings in English, Albanian, Italian and German. She studied the Stanislavski System of acting, graduating with a BA from the Academy of Performing Arts in Tirana. She also plays violin. From 1998 through 2002, Bleona released four albums, all of which reached the charts in southeastern Europe. In 1999 she headlined the Humanitarian Tour for the People of Kosovo, where she played a number of concerts around Europe. From 2000 to 2001 she performed more than 80 concerts across Europe, and by 2002 was headlining outdoor concerts and festivals. In that same year she released the DVD Nje xhiro neper Shqiperi (Walking Through Albania). In 2003 Bleona released the album Ti Nuk Di As Me Ma Lyp.

Her eighth album Mandarin sold over 800,000 copies in 2007, breaking her previous record.

Supporting her on tour was DJ Freestyle Steve and Brasco. Concert attendance ranged from 50 to 70,000 people per performance. In the summer 2013, Bleona announced the release of her single "Take It Like A Man" produced by StopWaitGo. Maximum Pop called it "an uplifting dance floor filler that screams 'GIRL POWER' at the top of its euro-pop lungs". She celebrated the track reaching #7 on the UK club charts by headlining Las Vegas Gay Pride on September 7, 2013. Bleona was invited to perform consecutive years at the "White Party", joining Lady Gaga as just the second artist to perform two years in a row. As a result, her single "Fuck You I'm Famous" became an anthem for the LGBTQ community.[citation needed] In 2015 following her time as a judge on X Factor Europe, Bleona's single "Take You Over" peaked at #3 on the Billboard Dance chart.[citation needed] Bleona recorded her version of the 1980s Italian hit song "Su Di Noi" originally by Enzo Ghinazzi.
