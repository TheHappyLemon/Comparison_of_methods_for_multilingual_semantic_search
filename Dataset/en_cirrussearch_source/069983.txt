10,000 (ten thousand) is the natural number following 9,999 and preceding 10,001. Many languages have a specific word for this number: in Ancient Greek it is μύριοι (the etymological root of the word myriad in English), in Aramaic ܪܒܘܬܐ, in Hebrew רבבה [revava], in Chinese 萬/万 (Mandarin wàn, Cantonese maan6, Hokkien bān), in Japanese 万/萬 [man], in Khmer ម៉ឺន [meun], in Korean 만/萬 [man], in Russian тьма [t'ma], in Vietnamese vạn, in Sanskrit अयुत [ayuta], in Thai หมื่น [meun], in Malayalam പതിനായിരം [patinayiram], and in Malagasy alina. In many of these languages, it often denotes a very large but indefinite number. The classical Greeks used letters of the Greek alphabet to represent Greek numerals: they used a capital letter mu (Μ) to represent ten thousand.[citation needed] This Greek root was used in early versions of the metric system in the form of the decimal prefix myria-. Depending on the country, the number ten thousand is usually written as 10,000 (including in the UK and US), 10.000, or 10 000. In scientific notation it is written as 104 or 1 E+4 (equivalently 1 E4) in E notation. It is the square of 100 and the square root of 100,000,000. The value of a myriad to the power of itself, 1000010000 = 1040000. It has a total of 25 divisors, whose geometric mean is a whole number, 100 (the number of primes below this value is 25). It has a reduced totient of 500, and a totient of 4,000, with a total of 16 integers having a totient value of 10,000. There are a total of 1,229 prime numbers less than ten thousand, a count that is itself prime.
