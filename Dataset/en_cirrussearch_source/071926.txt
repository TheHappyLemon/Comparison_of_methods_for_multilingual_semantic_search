Future Music Magazine uploaded a video to their YouTube channel at the end of May 2017 in which they accompany Alan Walker during a studio session. Walker explains how he and his co-producer Mood Melodies produced the song Alone. Walker appears very uncertain in the video and conveys a sense of planlessness or helplessness, whereas Melodies was able to convey the production process in great detail. This resulted in an extensive outpouring of criticism in which he received accusations from fans, forums, and online magazines that he was not producing his own songs. Other voices rebutted these claims, stating that Walker told in previous FAQs that he was producing with FL Studio, while in the video the production is completed with the Cubase program. Both programs were fundamentally different from each other.

Walker said in a press release, "With this record I got the opportunity to collaborate with some amazing artists. Noah Cyrus' voice is absolutely incredible!

It has a refreshing production that still fits well within my signature sound, which is important for me to maintain as I evolve as an artist."

The album includes hits like "Faded" and "Alone" as well as newer songs like "Lonely", a collaboration with Steve Aoki. About the song, Walker said, "On the vocals, we have two amazing talents. The first one is Omar Noir, who is a rapper from my hometown of Bergen. The second one is Ella Marie Hætta Isaksen from the band ISÁK. Both are rising stars, and I also loved how they brought influences from West African music as well as traditional joik that is representative of the indigenous Sami people that partially live in Northern Norway." Walker said of the album, "It's an incredible feeling to be able to release my debut album Different World. The past few years have been really surreal and I never imagined that I would ever get to this point. This album is something I have been working on for a long time and I am so excited to finally share it with the world and hear the reactions of my fans!"

Walker performed "End of Time" at X Games Norway on 6 March 2020. Four years after performing his hit "Faded" at the first X Games Norway in Oslo in 2016, Walker, K-391, and Ahrix performed the same at the Big Air Finals at X Games Norway. On 15 May 2020, Walker released a remix of Hans Zimmer's "Time". Walker had previously been gifted a signed copy of the score for "Time," and the two musicians first met in April 2019 in Barcelona during one of the dates of the "World of Hans Zimmer – A Symphonic Celebration" tour. This meeting led to talks about a possible collaboration, which finally saw the light of day. Walker said of the collaboration, "Everyone who knows me knows that I am a big Hans Zimmer fan. His work has played a huge role in my musical journey. Especially Time, which is my favorite song of all time. I am bowled over that my version of this song is the first ever official remix release of a Hans Zimmer work. I am so grateful for this opportunity!" he said. On 18 August 2021, Walker launched the "ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Special Edition," a custom gaming laptop created in partnership with ASUS and Republic of Gamers (ROG).

As a music producer and also an avid gamer, the G14 laptop is perfect for me to work on while I'm on the go. For this commercial, it was also amazing to work with the Norwegian actor and director Aksel Hennie, who I'm a big fan of. ASUS and I are also working on some exciting stuff for 2021, which I'm looking forward to unveiling."

On 10 November 2023, Walker released his fourth studio album, Walkerworld. There are currently 12 tracks in total, but new songs will be added every month in 2024. The album comes with the Fortnite game, a new tour, and the website walkerworld.ai. This album includes the song "Spectre 2.0" with Steve Aoki and "Land Of The Heroes" with Sophie Stray. On 4 January 2024, Walker released the song "Who I Am" with Norwegian singer Peder Elias and Indonesian singer Putri Ariani. The main drop of the song samples a song from the 1955 Norwegian film Karius and Baktus, composed by Christian Hartman (who also has a songwriting credit in the film). It is similar in style to Walker's song "On My Way" and incorporates orchestral elements. He was originally called "DJ Walkzz" and was part of several production collectives before becoming "Walkzz". The current logo consists of the initials "A" and "W" of Walker's real name, and was designed by Walker himself in 2013. To project his image, he uses a hoodie and face mask similar to the Black Bloc concept. Walker said: "At first we were thinking about ideas like how can we promote Alan Walker as an artist, but then we started creating symbols that anyone could do, and anyone with a hoodie and a face mask could do it. You can become a "Walker right away, and we are all equal, he explained his concept in an interview with KKBox. In an interview with NRK, when asked why he used a mask, he said, "To maintain the image they gave me. Basically, I'm focused on anonymity, so no one knows. But I can join Alan Walker and show that masks can look good on anyone." In the first promo pictures his management handed out, Walker's face was barely visible at all. Also in the music video for his single "Alone", he is all dressed as a black shadow figure. This is, according to the artist himself, a carefully planned image drawn up together with the record company Sony. "In a meeting with them we talked about how we could build the profile of Alan Walker", said Walker to the newspaper VG. "They asked about my interests. I replied PC, computer gaming and stuff like "Anonymous" and computer hacking where hoodies play a role." Walker acknowledges that it's a difficult time keeping low profile. Preferably, both he and his management means that the hoodie with a logo on the back is what he characterized by. "When I first created a Instagram account I never had pictures of myself, nor of nature and such. But it is difficult to remain anonymous." On stage he is accompanied by two other men who are also masked. "It's rare to see a trio in electronic music. I think it is a cool concept. We are in a way a small band." At a press conference 9 November 2016, Walker said: "The concept with the mask is very cool, that is inspired by the hacker group "Anonymous" and the television series "Mr. Robot". I have a background as a gamer and kept on with it before I started with music. By taking on a mask I can be immediately seen as a gamer." "I chose to quietly without a mask today. The concept ends in the trilogy. It will be interesting to open new doors and explore a bit. The mask is not lost permanently, but temporarily", which means he will take a break from his image – for a time. "With Alan Walker, the music is the focus, not necessarily everything around. It is a recurrent theme in the music of "Faded", "Sing Me To Sleep" and "Alone", which is a kind of conclusion to what one might call a trilogy", explains spokeperson Yonas Aregai for the record label MER." "A lot of people ask me why I am wearing a mask. The mask is more of a sign and a symbol of unity and being alike each other, rather than me being different." said Walker, behind the scenes of the single "Alone". When it comes to making music what I feel is the most important thing is to basically have a musical freedom, and that I can make whatever I want to. — Alan Walker, Walker's musical style is much darker and more minor than the harmonies that characterize Kygo's contemporary tropical house. Walker's music is reminiscent of slightly slower-tempo progressive house, 1990s trance music, or dubstep with a smoother rhythmic edge. Originally, Walker was worried that his musical style wouldn't "fit in with the crowd," he said. Walker's main priorities when creating music are melody, melancholy, and mood. "I think sometimes people focus too much on having the best drum sample or having the perfect drum beat for a song or the perfect bass line, but at the end of the day, the audience, they don't think about whether the drums sound cool or if the bass sounds amazing, it's all about the melodies. You won't be singing and going around beatboxing to the beat – most likely – or trying to remember where the bass line goes. You'll be going around trying to remember the melody of the song or the vocals. That is actually what I want to try and focus on in my music, because I've always been a fan of melodies," Walker said in an interview with Rolling Stone. Walker was inspired by music producer Ahrix's sound on his 2013 track "Nova." In an interview, he said, "The melody and the way the track progressed was very unique, which later became the inspiration for creating 'Fade.'" We also take inspiration from Norwegian producers K-391 and David Whistle. Walker calls David Whistle "my biggest inspiration." The classical aspects of Walker's songs were influenced by film composers such as Hans Zimmer and Steve Jablonsky. Alan Walker has generally been well received by critics. His music has been praised for its creative production, unique style, and melodic sound. Critics have also noted the strong emotional impact of his music. However, many have criticized Alan Walker's music for being too repetitive and lacking in lyrical content. Other critics have been divided on his use of vocal samples, with some praising it for adding an extra layer of emotion to his music while others have argued that it detracts from the overall appeal of the music. Additionally, Walker received criticism from a "walkthrough" video on the production of his song "Alone", via the YouTube channel Future Music Magazine. Due to his co-producer Mood Melodies's extensive involvement in the production of the song, the video was met with backlash from many of Walker's fans, who considered Mood Melodies as his "ghost-producer". In 2022, Walker created a song titled "Ritual" which had been played numerous times on his performances before release in November 2022, the same date as he released "Walkerverse. pt. II", an EP the song originally was part of. The song ended up being released as a single due to issues. Julie Bergan, a Norwegian singer-songwriter Walker collaborated with before, was reportedly part of the songwriting team, and she accompanied Walker as a singer for the song in live performances. The song featuring her voice was frequently used in teasers for the second part of the Walkerverse album, but they were ultimately unused in the final song. Upon release, many fans were critical of the new singer and deemed her vocals inferior to Bergan's. Bergan's manager Cecile Torp-Holte stated that there was no agreement between her and MER on using Bergan's vocals. According to Torp-Holte, six concerts were planned in the US where Bergan was to perform with Walker, including a performance of "Ritual" as part of a larger agreement. She also said that the song's original release date was 28 October, and the negotiations on sharing rights collapsed shortly before. In 2018, Walker donated a portion of the proceeds from his single "All Falls Down" to the World Wildlife Fund, which also supports charities such as Save the Children and UNICEF. In 2019, Walker donated more than $100,000 to Team Trees, a joint fundraising effort initiated by American YouTube stars MrBeast and Mark Rober to plant 20 million trees. First, Mr. Beast donated $100,000 and left an invitation for others to follow suit, commenting, "I dare you to take this space from me :)." Then Walker responded to his comment, "I want to plant a tree!" and matched his $100,000 donation. Different World (2018) World of Walker (2021) Walkerverse Pt.
