Matej Mohorič (born 19 October 1994) is a Slovenian professional road racing cyclist who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Team Bahrain Victorious. Mohorič turned professional in 2014. He won the Slovenian National Road Race Championships in 2018 and 2021, and the UCI Gravel World Championships in 2023. Born on 19 October 1994, in Kranj, Slovenia, Mohorič currently resides in Šenčur, Slovenia. Mohorič won the 2012 UCI World Junior Road Race Championships and the 2013 UCI World Under-23 Road Race Championships, becoming the first rider to win world junior and under-23 titles in consecutive years. He signed with Cannondale, a UCI ProTeam, for the 2014 season. Mohorič signed with Cannondale–Garmin, a UCI ProTeam, for the 2015 season. He was named in the start list for the 2015 Vuelta a España, but he withdrew on the 6th stage. Subsequently, it was announced that he would join Lampre–Merida from 2016 on a two-year contract. He was named in the start list for the 2016 Giro d'Italia. Mohorič secured his first Grand Tour stage win when he soloed to victory in Stage 7 of the 2017 Vuelta a España. In Stage 10 of the 2018 Giro d'Italia he took his second win in a Grand Tour, winning a two-man sprint against Nico Denz. In July 2019, he was named in the startlist for the 2019 Tour de France. He participated in the 2020 Tour de France and the 2021 Tour de France, garnering two stage wins in the 2021 Tour after crashing out of the Giro two months before. His second victory came the day after a police raid on the Bahrain Victorious hotel stemming from allegations of doping; Mohorič celebrated his win by 'zipping' his lips, adding in a post-race interview, "At the end of the day I’ve got nothing to hide. I don’t care too much." In 2022, Mohorič won the Milan-San Remo monument, attacking on the descent of the Poggio using a dropper seatpost. He defeated Jonas Vingegaard to win the 2022 CRO Race. He won stage 19 of the 2023 Tour de France in a photo finish with Kasper Asgreen, by a margin of 0.004 seconds. He later received praise for his interview after the race, in which he talked about the cruel nature of professional cycling. In October 2023, Mohorič won the UCI Gravel World Championships, holding off Florian Vermeersch and Connor Swift during a solo attack in the final 20 km of the 169 km course in Veneto, Italy. 2011 3rd Overall GP Général Patton 7th Overall Regio-Tour 2012 UCI Junior Road World Championships 1st Road race 2nd Time trial 1st Overall Giro di Basilicata 1st Points classification 1st Mountains classification 1st Stages 1, 2, 3 (ITT), & 4 1st Overall Giro della Lunigiana 1st Overall Junioren Radrundfahrt Oberösterreich UEC European Road Championships 3rd Time trial 4th Road race 2013 1st Road race, UCI Road World Under-23 Championships National Road Championships 4th Road race 4th Time trial 7th Piccolo Giro di Lombardia 2014 5th Road race, National Road Championships 2015 5th Road race, National Road Championships 6th Japan Cup 2016 (1 pro win) 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships 3rd Overall Tour of Hainan 1st Stage 6 2017 (2) 1st Stage 7 Vuelta a España 1st Hong Kong Challenge 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 6th Overall Tour of Guangxi 8th Trofeo Laigueglia 2018 (7) 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st Overall Deutschland Tour 1st Points classification 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 3 1st Overall BinckBank Tour 1st GP Industria & Artigianato di Larciano 1st Stage 10 Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 1 Tour of Austria 3rd Overall Tour of Slovenia 7th Giro della Toscana 2019 (1) 1st Stage 7 Tour de Pologne National Road Championships 2nd Time trial 5th Road race 3rd Gran Premio di Lugano 5th Milan–San Remo 9th Gent–Wevelgem 2020 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 4th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 10th Milan–San Remo 2021 (4) 1st Road race, National Road Championships Tour de France 1st Stages 7 & 19 Held after Stage 7 Combativity award Stages 7 & 19 2nd Overall Benelux Tour 1st Stage 7 2nd Overall Tour de Pologne 2nd Clásica de San Sebastián 7th Overall Tour of Slovenia 1st Points classification 8th Amstel Gold Race 10th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 2022 (2) 1st Overall CRO Race 1st Milan–San Remo 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships 2nd Gran Piemonte 4th E3 Saxo Bank Classic 5th Paris–Roubaix 9th Gent–Wevelgem 2023 (6) 1st Overall Tour de Pologne 1st Sprints classification 1st Stage 2 1st Stage 19 Tour de France 1st Stage 4 CRO Race 2nd Overall Tour of Slovenia 1st Stage 5 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 3rd Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 5th Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec 6th Strade Bianche 7th Overall Renewi Tour 1st Stage 5 7th E3 Saxo Classic 8th Milan–San Remo 2024 (1) 1st Stage 2 Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 5th Strade Bianche 6th Milan–San Remo 2023 1st UCI World Championships "Bahrain Merida Pro Cycling Team".
