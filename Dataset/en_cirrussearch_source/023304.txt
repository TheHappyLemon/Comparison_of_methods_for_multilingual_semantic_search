Theodore "Ted" Boronovskis (born 27 July 1943) is an Australian judoka who won a bronze medal at the 1964 Summer Olympics. This was Australia's only Olympic medal in judo until 2000. Judo made its Olympic debut in 1964, and Boronovskis was Australia's only judo representative, competing in the open division (unlimited weight). He won his first two matches, but then lost to the eventual gold medalist, Anton Geesink.
