Mark Pavlovych Padun (Ukrainian: Марк Павлович Падун; born 6 July 1996) is a Ukrainian cyclist, who currently rides for UCI ProTeam Team Corratec–Vini Fantini. In the years 2016 and 2017, Mark Padun raced for Team Colpack. In 2017, he won a stage of the Giro Ciclistico d'Italia and after Matija Kvasina, winner of the 2017 Flèche du Sud, tested positive for EPO, Padun's second place was upgraded to first overall. In August 2017, Padun joined Bahrain–Merida as a stagiaire, and received a regular contract for the next season. In 2018 and 2019, he raced in the Vuelta a España. In 2019, he won the Ukrainian National Time Trial Championships. In October 2020, he raced in the Giro d'Italia and finished in second place on stage 12. In 2021, Padun won Stages 7 and 8 of the Critérium du Dauphiné, after spending each day in the breakaway, while also collecting enough points to win the mountains classification. By dropping his companions in the breakaway and holding off the group of favorites on two consecutive days, these wins sparked sceptic commentary from riders and staff of other teams. The French newspaper Le Parisien published quotes calling his performance "an absolute disgrace" and that it "reminds us of the dirty 2000s". Despite his strong performance, he was not nominated for the Tour de France by his team, nor was he taken to the Men's individual road race at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics by his federation, to the surprise of observers. In an interview with L'Équipe, he defended himself against doping suspicions, citing weight problems as reason for his inconsistent performances. For the 2022 season, he signed a contract at EF Education–EasyPost. Team manager Jonathan Vaughters emphasised his trust in Padun, and justified it with "physiological tests" and "instinct". In February, Padun won stage 4 of O Gran Camiño, his first top ten in a time trial against an international field. 2014 1st Time trial, National Junior Road Championships 10th Overall Course de la Paix Juniors 2015 1st Criterium, National Road Championships Giro della Regione Friuli Venezia Giulia 1st Mountains classification 1st Stage 3 8th Overall Course de la Paix U23 9th GP Capodarco 2016 1st Time trial, National Under-23 Road Championships 2nd Giro del Medio Brenta 3rd Overall Giro della Valle d'Aosta 1st Mountains classification 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 2 3rd Overall Vuelta al Bidasoa 2017 1st Overall Flèche du Sud 1st Young rider classification 1st Trofeo Banca Popolare di Vicenza 1st GP Capodarco 5th Overall Giro Ciclistico d'Italia 1st Stage 3 2018 1st Stage 5 Tour of the Alps 5th Road race, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 2019 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Overall Adriatica Ionica Race 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 3 2021 Critérium du Dauphiné 1st Mountains classification 1st Stages 7 & 8 3rd Overall Vuelta a Burgos 2022 3rd Overall O Gran Camiño 1st Stage 4 (ITT) Combativity award Stage 6 Vuelta a España 2023 4th Overall Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali "Bahrain Merida Pro Cycling Team".
