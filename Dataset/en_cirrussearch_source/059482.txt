Reviews from critics and fans were mixed, with the general consensus being that while 2Pac's vocals were undoubtedly strong, the modern production sounded commercialized. AllMusic wrote: "This isn't to say that there is not some great material on Pac's Life, because there is ..., but the power of 2Pac's words is often lost behind the modern production ... and new verses from artists like Ludacris, Lil Scrappy, Ashanti, and Young Buck." Pac's Life debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 159,000 copies in its first week. This became 2Pac's tenth US top-ten album and his seventh posthumous album to reach the top-ten. "Jay-Z Reclaims His 'Kingdom' With No. 1 Debut". Billboard. November 29, 2006.
