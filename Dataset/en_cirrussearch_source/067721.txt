JOTX-DTV (channel 7), branded as TV Tokyo, is a Japanese television station that serves as the flagship of the TX Network. It is owned and operated by TV Tokyo Corporation, itself a subsidiary of TV Tokyo Holdings Corporation, in turn a subsidiary of Nikkei, Inc. It is headquartered in the Sumitomo Fudosan Roppongi Grand Tower in Roppongi, Minato, Tokyo. TV Tokyo is one of the five private broadcasters based in Tokyo, and the last to have started its broadcasts on VHF. The predecessor of TV Tokyo was Tokyo Channel 12, which was broadcast using the bandwidth returned by the US military stationed in Japan. However, similar to Nihon Educational Television (NET TV), which was also a private educational television station, Tokyo Channel 12 faced a serious business crisis after its launch due to low ratings. Nihon Keizai Shimbun took over the operation of Tokyo Channel 12 in 1969 and officially converted it into a comprehensive television station in 1973. In 1981, Tokyo Channel 12 was renamed TV Tokyo. Since its launch, TV Tokyo's ratings have been ranked last among the core bureaus in Tokyo, and its program production costs are also far lower than those of other stations. Moreover, TXN does not cover the whole of Japan, and its scale is much smaller than the other four network networks. However, the above-mentioned unfavorable factors also make TV Tokyo's program arrangement and news content significantly different from other private TV stations. It has unique program creativity and style, and has established unique strong areas such as animation and economic programs. TV Tokyo was established by the Japan Science Foundation in 1951 and started broadcasting, as Science TV Tokyo Channel 12 Television (科学テレビ東京12チャンネルテレビ, Kagaku Terebi Tōkyō Jūni-channeru Terebi) on April 12, 1964. It took its name from its VHF frequency channel 12. It almost went bankrupt in 1968; on July 1 that year, a limited liability company, Tokyo Channel 12 Production was established with the help of the Nikkei and Mainichi Broadcasting System. On July 2, 1960, the Japan Science and Technology Promotion Foundation applied to the Ministry of Post for a television broadcast license for the VHF12 channel returned by the U.S. military stationed in Japan.
