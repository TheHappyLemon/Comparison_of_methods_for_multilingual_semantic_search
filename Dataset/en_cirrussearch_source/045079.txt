Kyle Henry Erovre Okposo (born April 16, 1988) is an American professional ice hockey right winger for the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously played for the New York Islanders and the Buffalo Sabres. He was drafted seventh overall by the Islanders in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. Okposo played one season in the United States Hockey League (USHL) with the Des Moines Buccaneers, in which he was named the most valuable player of the USHL playoffs and the league's top rookie. He helped the Buccaneers to a Clark Cup victory. During his freshman season at University of Minnesota, Okposo was placed at the center position, even though he is a natural winger. Throughout most of the season this became his most common position due to the abundance of wingers on the team. On June 7, 2007, Okposo announced he would be returning to the University of Minnesota for the 2007–08 season. Okposo played for Minnesota until December 19, 2007, when he decided to sign a three-year, entry-level contract with the Islanders. Okposo's decision to leave school was considered controversial by some. As a response to questioning, Islanders general manager Garth Snow told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, "Quite frankly, we weren't happy with the program. They have a responsibility to coach, to make Kyle a better player, and they were not doing that." Coach Don Lucia then claimed that the Islanders put him "in a very difficult position." In his response to Snow's comments, Lucia emphasized the importance of obtaining a degree, "We have had numerous players sign and play in the NHL, but just as important many more move on to have successful careers after graduating from the University of Minnesota. We have always and will continue to work to ensure our players reach their potential on the ice and in the classroom." Okposo signed an entry-level contract with the Islanders and was assigned to their top minor league affiliate, the AHL's Bridgeport Sound Tigers. He made his NHL debut on March 18, 2008, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, and netted his first career NHL goal on March 21, 2008, against the New Jersey Devils, a game-winner scored on the powerplay against Martin Brodeur. He also scored in his final game of the season in a game against the New York Rangers. On September 17, 2009, Okposo suffered a mild concussion after a check to the head by Dion Phaneuf. He returned to the Islanders' lineup for their opening game on October 3, 2009. On May 25, 2011, he signed a five-year, $14 million contract with the New York Islanders. Okposo broke out in the 2013–14 season, shortly after a strong 2013 playoffs against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Playing on a line mostly with John Tavares and Thomas Vanek, Okposo scored 69 points in 71 games, leading the Islanders in points for the first and only time since he and Tavares were on the team together (Mathew Barzal also led the Islanders in scoring with Tavares on the roster, but not Okposo). He scored his 100th career goal on October 14, 2014, against the New York Rangers. On January 16, 2015, Okposo scored four goals against the Penguins, also being his first NHL hat trick. On July 1, 2016, Okposo signed a seven-year, $42 million contract with the Buffalo Sabres. During his first season with the club, Okposo recorded 45 points in 65 games. He also represented the team at the 2017 National Hockey League All-Star Game. He missed time at the end of the season after suffering a concussion and having a reaction to the medication. Okposo's output declined in each of the next four seasons and fans eventually began to call for him to be bought out of his contract. However, he posted a strong bounce back in the 2021–22 season, recording 21 goals and 24 assists for 45 points, his highest total since his first season with the Sabres. After spending the previous season as an alternate, Okposo was named the 20th captain in Sabres history ahead of the 2022–23 season. Having completed his seven-year contract with the Sabres, Okposo continued his tenure as team captain in signing a one-year, $2.5 million contract extension with Buffalo on May 24, 2023. Okposo then played his 1,000th NHL game on November 14, 2023, in a 5–2 loss to the Boston Bruins. On March 8, 2024, Okposo was traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Calle Själin and a conditional 2024 seventh-round pick. Okposo's Nigerian father, Kome Okposo, and American mother, Michelle Okposo, are both pharmacists. Okposo and his wife have four children.[citation needed] Okposo has been open about having experienced mental health struggles during his hockey career. In 2017, Okposo experienced a mood change and was prescribed medicines which had the negative side-effect of appetite loss which resulted in Okposo's weight dropping from 211 pounds to 199 pounds. In late March 2017, Okposo was hospitalized in the neurosurgical intensive care unit in Buffalo General Hospital and missed the remainder of the season. In January 2007, he played for the United States national junior team in the 2007 IIHF World Junior Championship. "Sophomore Okposo leaves Minnesota to sign with Islanders". ESPN.com.
