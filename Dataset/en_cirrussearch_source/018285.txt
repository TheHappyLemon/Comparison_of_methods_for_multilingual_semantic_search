Friedrich von Löwis of Menar (Russian: Фёдор Фёдорович Левиз, romanized: Fëdor Fëdorovič Leviz; 6 September [O.S. 26 August] 1767 – 16 April [O.S. 4] 1824) was a Baltic German lieutenant-general of Scottish origin, who served in the Imperial Russian Army during the Napoleonic Wars. His family (the family name commonly spelled in English as Lewis) came from South Scotland to Sweden around 1630. By the time of Friedrich's birth, it had become a well-established noble family settled in Livonia in the Russian Empire. In German personal names, von is a preposition which approximately means of or from and usually denotes some sort of nobility. While von (always lower case) is part of the family name or territorial designation, not a first or middle name, if the noble is referred to by his last name, use Schiller, Clausewitz or Goethe, not von Schiller, etc. Henning von Löwis of Menar (Author), Ich wäre gern geblieben.
