The UCI Road World Championships â€“ Men's team time trial was a world championship for road bicycle racing in the discipline of team time trial (TTT). It was organized by the world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). The mixed team relay replaced the men's and women's team time trial events at the world championships from 2019. A championship for national teams was introduced in 1962 and held until 1994. It was held annually, except that from 1972 onward, the TTT was not held in Olympic years. There were 4 riders per team on a route around 100 kilometres long. Italy is the most successful nation with seven victories. There was a long break until a championship for trade teams was introduced in 2012. There were 6 riders per team. The championship was held up to 2018. Cotton, Jim (2021-09-21).
