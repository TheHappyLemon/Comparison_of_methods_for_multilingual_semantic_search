Victor Erik Olof Hedman (pronounced [ˈvɪ̌kːtɔr ˈhěːdman]; born 18 December 1990) is a Swedish professional ice hockey defenceman and alternate captain for the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL). Hedman was selected second overall by the Lightning in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft and made his NHL debut that year. Widely considered to be one of the best defencemen in the NHL, Hedman is a six-time James Norris Memorial Trophy finalist, winning the award in 2018. Hedman won back-to-back Stanley Cups with the Lightning in 2020 and 2021, and won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the 2020 playoffs. Hedman began his junior ice hockey career in the Swedish J20 SuperElit with the Modo Hockey organization. He recorded 25 points in 34 games during his first full season in the league in 2006–07. Hedman then turned professional and joined the Elitserien with Modo at age 16. At the beginning of the 2008–09 season, he was ranked first overall amongst all draft-eligible skaters in the International Scouting Services' preliminary rankings. In the same season, he was nominated as the SHL Rookie of the Year. Following his performance at the 2009 World Junior Championships for Sweden, Hedman was listed atop the rankings of European skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. Despite the unlikelihood of Hedman playing in Russia, he was drafted 83rd overall by the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)'s Spartak Moscow on 1 June 2009. Going into the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, Hedman was listed as the second-ranked player and top European player. He was drafted second overall by the Tampa Bay Lightning, behind John Tavares, who was drafted first overall by the New York Islanders. Hedman has drawn comparisons to Hart Trophy-winning defenceman Chris Pronger, who is also 6' 6" and 220 pounds, as well as also being drafted second overall. Hedman made his NHL debut for the Lightning on 3 October 2009, against the Atlanta Thrashers. He registered his first point, an assist, on a Martin St. Louis goal. His first NHL goal was then scored on 5 December against Dwayne Roloson of the New York Islanders. On 5 January 2011, half way into his sophomore NHL season in 2010–11, Hedman checked Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby from behind, receiving a minor boarding penalty. The hit was one of two that were eventually blamed for causing a severe concussion on Crosby that kept him out of play for the rest of the season and most of the 2011–12 season. After ending the 2010–11 season with 3 goals, 23 assists and 26 points in 79 games and helped the Lightning clinch a playoff spot for the first time since 2007, Hedman made his Stanley Cup Playoff debut on 13 April 2011 against the Pittsburgh Penguins. On 29 November 2011, shortly into the 2011–12 season, Hedman signed a five-year, $20 million contract extension with Tampa Bay. On 25 September 2012, it was announced that Hedman signed a contract with Barys Astana of the KHL during the 2012–13 NHL lockout. In January 2013, Hedman returned to the NHL after lockout ended, playing 44 games of the shortened 48-game season and registering 4 goals, 16 assists and 20 points. During the 2013–14 season, Hedman had a breakout season, posting a career best in goals (13), assists (42) and points (55) in 75 contests played. Hedman followed up his breakout season with a strong start to the 2014–15 season. However, his start would be derailed after he suffered a broken finger in a game against the Vancouver Canucks on 18 October 2014, which was expected to rule him out of play for four to six weeks. At the time, Hedman was tied for the lead amongst NHL defencemen with seven points, and was considered a possible James Norris Memorial Trophy candidate for Defenceman of the Year entering into the season. Despite this injury, Hedman still had a productive season with the Lightning, scoring 10 goals, 28 assists and 38 points in 59 games played. After Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks, Hedman had recorded the most points by a Lightning defencemen in a single playoff year, with 1 goal, 11 assists and 12 points. On 8 June 2015, during Game 3 of the Final series, Hedman set Lightning records for career playoff assists (20) and points (23) by a defenceman, surpassing Dan Boyle, who previously held the record with three goals and 19 assists (22 points). On 24 October 2015, Hedman played in his 400th career NHL game in an overtime loss to the Chicago Blackhawks. On 20 December, Hedman recorded his 200th NHL point, which was an assist on a Nikita Kucherov power play goal. The point came during a 5–2 Lightning victory over the visiting Ottawa Senators. On 20 May 2016, Hedman recorded two assists in a 4–3 Lightning win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on goals by Ryan Callahan and Jonathan Drouin, respectively. The two assists moved Hedman past Vincent Lecavalier (28) and Brad Richards (29) for number two all-time in playoff assists with the franchise. In game six on 24 May, Hedman became the leader in playoff games played for the Lightning. He surpassed former teammates Martin St. Louis and Vincent Lecavalier, who were tied for the most playoffs games played in franchise history. The Lightning would eventually fall in seven games to the Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals by losing game seven 2–1 for a 4–3 defeat in the series, one win short from a second consecutive appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. On 1 July 2016, the Lightning re-signed Hedman to an eight-year contract extension worth $7.875 million per season. In the previous season, Hedman led all Lightning defencemen in goals (10), assists (37), points (47) and plus/minus. He also led all Lightning skaters in assists, plus/minus, average ice time (23:03), takeaways (48) and blocked shots (132). He also posted a career high with a plus-21 rating.

He later became one of the youngest players to play for Sweden's men's team when he made his debut at age 17 in an exhibition game against Norway. Hedman would once again play for Sweden's junior team at the 2009 World Junior Championships in Ottawa, where he met Canada for the second consecutive year in the gold-medal game, earning another silver medal in a 5–1 loss. On 2 March 2016, the Swedish Ice Hockey Association named Hedman to its roster for the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. Hedman was joined by Lightning teammate Anton Strålman. The tournament ran from 17 September to 1 October 2016 in Toronto. On 15 April 2017, the Swedish Ice Hockey Association named Hedman to its roster for the 2017 IIHF World Championship.

Hedman has two older brothers – Oscar Hedman, who was also a professional hockey player that played for Modo Hockey; as well as Johan Hedman, who does not play professionally. As a child, Hedman originally started out playing as a goaltender. He also played hockey on the streets together with his friends, among them, famous iRacing driver Fredrik Sellgren. His father, Olle Hedman, told his son that if he left the net, he would purchase him the new helmet that he coveted. He has not played in goal since that day. Victor said, "I'm thankful for that now. You never know what would have happened otherwise." Hedman's other passions were flying (he has logged eight hours on a Piper PA-32), and football. His father said that his son would just outrun everyone on the field. Hedman still plays soccer in the summer, and religiously follows the sport. He supports Premier League side Manchester United In an article, it was revealed that when quizzed on any player on any Premier League team, he could not be stumped. His dad said that his son "probably knows more about football than hockey". However, "Hedman knew that hockey would be his future, encouraged by some of the game's greats. They'd come back every summer to play for a team called the Icebreakers, inviting Hedman to play." Some notable players on the team included Peter Forsberg, Markus Näslund, Henrik Zetterberg and Nicklas Bäckström. Hedman said that "looking back at it now, it was an unbelievable experience". In 2014, Hedman started a hockey school in his hometown. The spots in the school sold out in two hours. Hedman said that "to see the thrill in the kids' eyes, it's worth it all". Hedman is from Örnsköldsvik and trains with the twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin in the off-season. In a 2016 interview with The Hockey News, Hedman explained why he wears the jersey number 77. During his childhood in Sweden, he regularly watched Colorado Avalanche games; one of the Avalanche's star players at the time, Peter Forsberg, is Swedish. A memorable moment for Hedman came at the conclusion of the 2001 Stanley Cup Finals, when Avalanche captain Joe Sakic handed the Stanley Cup to teammate Ray Bourque (one of Hedman's favorite players), who had played 22 years in the NHL before winning a championship. Hedman wore the jersey number 41 in Sweden, but when he was drafted by the Lightning, that number was already worn by Mike Smith. Hedman chose his new number, 77, as a tribute to Bourque. Normally the Guldpucken is awarded to a player in Sweden, but Hedman won the award for his play in the NHL. "Victor Hedman Stats and News". "International Scouting Services Preliminary Rankings".
