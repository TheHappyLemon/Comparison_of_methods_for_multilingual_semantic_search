The Cher (French pronunciation: [ʃɛʁ] ; Occitan: Char) is a river in central France, a left tributary of the Loire. It is 365.1 km (226.9 mi) long, and its basin area is 13,718 km2 (5,297 sq mi). Its source is in the Creuse department, north-east of Crocq. It joins the river Loire at Villandry, west of Tours. The river suffered a devastating flood in 1940, which damaged the Château de Chenonceau, which spans the river, and other structures along the banks. It owes its name to the pre-Indo-European root kʰar 'stone'. The Cher flows through the following departments, and along the following towns: Creuse Allier: Montluçon Cher: Saint-Amand-Montrond, Vierzon Loir-et-Cher Indre-et-Loire: Tours The main tributaries of the Cher are, from spring to mouth (L: left / R: right): (L) Tardes (L) Voueize (R) Amaron or Lamaron at Montluçon (R) Aumance at Meaulne (R) Yèvre at Vierzon (L) Auron (R) Colin (L) Arnon at Vierzon (L) Théols (R) Sauldre at Selles-sur-Cher (L) Fouzon above Saint-Aignan The Cher was part of a network of waterways that linked the city of Tours to Nevers, where connections to other regions of France existed.
