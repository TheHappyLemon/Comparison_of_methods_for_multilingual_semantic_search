Paris Dauphine University - PSL (French: Université Paris Dauphine - PSL) is a Grande École and public institution of higher education and research based in Paris, France. As of 2022, Dauphine has 9,400 students in 8 fields of study (law, economics, finance, computer science, journalism, management, mathematics, social sciences), plus 3,800 in executive education. Its status as a grand établissement, adopted in 2004, allows it to select its students. On average, 90 to 95% of accepted students received either high distinctions or the highest distinctions at their French High School National Exam results (Examen National du Baccalauréat). While not itself having the legal status of a public university, it is a constituent college of PSL University. Dauphine is also a member of the Conférence des Grandes Écoles. Research at Dauphine concerns "organization and decision sciences", organized in 6 research laboratories (5 of which are mixed units also staffed by CNRS researchers): the CEREMADE Center for Research in Decision Mathematics, the CR2D Dauphine Law Research Center, DRM Dauphine Management Research, the IRISSO Interdisciplinary Research Institute in Social Science, the LAMSADE Laboratory for Analysis and Modeling of Decision Support Systems, and the LEDa Dauphine Economics Laboratory. A total of 519 research staff work at Dauphine. Dauphine was founded on 24 October 1968 as a university center with the status of a faculty, named Centre universitaire Dauphine. On 17 December 1970, as part of the division of the ancient University of Paris into 13 universities, it became an "établissement public à caractère scientifique et culturel", named Université Paris-IX Dauphine. The university was established in the Palais Dauphine, also known as the Palais de l'OTAN ("NATO Palace"), a building designed by Jacques Carlu and built at Porte Dauphine between 1955 and 1957 to serve as the NATO headquarters. It served that function between 1959 and 1966, when France left the NATO alliance. Paris-IX Dauphine was designated as an "experimental university", and was one of the very few universities in France to select students on the basis of their Baccalauréat scores. The legality of this was disputed, and some rejected students threatened lawsuits and were subsequently quietly admitted, a strategy that became increasingly popular by 2002. In response, in 2004, Dauphine ceased being a public university and became a grand établissement under the name Université Paris-Dauphine, which legally allows it to practice selective admissions. In 2009, Université Paris-Dauphine gained EQUIS (EFMD Quality Improvement System) accreditation, awarded by the European Foundation for Management Development. In 2011, Université Paris-Dauphine was one of the 16 co-founders of Paris Sciences et Lettres University (PSL). On 5 November 2019, PSL became formally established as a public university, organized in the form of a collegiate university (modelled after British collegiate universities such as Oxford and Cambridge) allowing its constituent institutions to keep their legal personality. On the same date, Dauphine officially became a college of PSL. It now self-styles its name as Université Paris Dauphine - PSL. Paris Dauphine University - PSL has a campus in Tunis offering bachelors and masters programs, and a campus in London offering courses in cooperation with University College London. It offers joint degree programs with the Autonomous University of Madrid (in economics, management, and social sciences), and with Goethe University in Frankfurt (in economic sciences).
