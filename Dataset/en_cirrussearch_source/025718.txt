Freedom of expression in the Persian-speaking countries of Iran, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan is low. Knowledge about copyright rules is poor in Iran that hinders users. Tariffs for National Information Network is 75% cheaper than internet price. Iran ranks last in Freedom House freedom of the press ranking, there is a challenge for finding Persian citations. According to reports by human rights lawyer Shadi Sadr, RFERL, Iranwire, Iran International, Justice for Iran, Open Democracy, Radio Zamaneh and other news outlets, the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance and the Iranian Cyber Army may be interfering the Persian Wikipedia, although the Wikimedia Foundation denies that there is abuse taking place. In 2019, German news outlet Deutsche Welle reported that WMF had launched an investigation. In a November 2013 report published by the Center for Global Communication Studies of the University of Pennsylvania, researchers Collin Anderson and Nima Nazeri scanned 800,000 Persian language Wikipedia articles and found that the Iranian government blocks 963 of these pages. According to the authors, "Censors repeatedly targeted Wikipedia pages about government rivals, minority religious beliefs, and criticisms of the state, officials, and the police. Just under half of the blocked Wiki-pages are biographies, including pages about individuals the authorities have allegedly detained or killed." Anderson said that Persian Wikipedia, as a microcosm of the Iranian internet, is a "useful place to uncover the types of online content forbidden and an excellent template to identify keyword blocking themes and filtering rules that apply across the greater internet." On 2 March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, the Persian Wikipedia appeared to be disrupted in Iran after the death of Mohammad Mirmohammadi, who was a close confidant to the country's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. 100,000 entries celebration logo (August 2010) Persian Wikipedia's Nowruz logo (21 March 2015) Persian Wikipedia's Nowruz logo (21 March 2016) Persian Wikipedia's 500,000 article logo (27 July 2016) Persian Wikipedia's Nowruz logo (21 March 2017) 600,000 entries celebration logo (March 2018) Persian Wikipedia's Nowruz logo (21 March 2019) 800,000 entries celebration logo (May 2021) 900,000 entries celebration logo (April 2022) List of Wikipedias List of Wikipedias Archived 2022-07-11 at the Wayback Machine.
