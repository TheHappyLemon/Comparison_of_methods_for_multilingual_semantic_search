The Iron Bridge (Latvian: Dzelzs tilts) or Semigallia Bridge (Zemgales tilts) was a bridge that crossed the Daugava river in Riga, the capital of Latvia. It was built in 1871–72. The bridge was bombarded twice, during World War I and World War II, and was not rebuilt after the last war. The only remains of the bridge are its pillars in the river. Gunta Vilka.
