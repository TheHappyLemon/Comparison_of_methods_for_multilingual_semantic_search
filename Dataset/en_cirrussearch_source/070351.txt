According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 16,215 people. Kabugao is 606 kilometres (377 mi) from Manila. On July 12, 1915, Governor General Francis Burton Harrison issued Executive Order No. 45, transferring the capital of then sub-province of Apayao from Tauit to Kabugao, to be effective on August 1. Kabugao was occupied for a year by the Japanese during the Second World War. It was captured in December 1942, after the USAFIP NL retreated from the town.[citation needed] In the 19th Congress of the Philippines, house bills were filed by various representatives which seek to automatically convert Kabugao and other capital towns of provinces with no current component cities, independent component cities, or highly urbanized cities into cities. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the municipality has a land area of 935.12 square kilometres (361.05 sq mi)  constituting 21.19% of the 4,413.35-square-kilometre- (1,704.00 sq mi) total area of Apayao.
