Yegor Alexandrovich Sharangovich (Belarusian: Ягор Аляксандравіч Шаранговіч, romanized: Jahor Alaksandravič Šaranhovič, Russian: Егор Александрович Шарангович; born 6 June 1998) is a Belarusian professional ice hockey forward for the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted by the New Jersey Devils, 141st overall, in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft, and made his NHL debut in 2020. Prior to joining the Devils Sharangovich played two seasons with Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League, as well as two seasons in the American Hockey League. Internationally Sharangovich has played for the Belarusian national team at both the junior and senior level, including four World Championships. Sharangovich played as a youth in his native Belarus, with Dinamo-Raubichi Minsk at the under-20 level and also the second tier Vysshaya Liga as an affiliate to top Belarusian club, HC Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). His development was noticed in North America, as he was drafted 252nd overall by the Youngstown Phantoms of the 2017 USHL Entry Draft. Opting to remain in Belarus, Sharangovich made his debut with Dinamo Minsk during the 2017–18 season appearing in 47 games as a rookie, collecting 4 goals and 12 points. After being passed over in previous drafts, Sharangovich was selected as an overage pick by the New Jersey Devils in the fifth-round, 141st overall, of the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. Following the NHL draft, Sharangovich agreed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Devils on 19 July 2018. After participating in the Devils training camp, Sharangovich was re-assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Binghamton Devils, to start the 2018–19 season. Upon joining the Devils, he scored his first North American professional goal on 10 October 2018 against the Hartford Wolf Pack. Sharangovich continued to improve throughout the season and quickly tallied eight goals and five assists through 36 games while also playing on the Devils penalty kill unit. With the 2020–21 season to be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 16 July 2020, Sharangovich opted to return to Dinamo Minsk on loan from the Devils, and play in the KHL until the resumption of the North American season. Returning to the Devils on the commencement of the season, on 16 January 2021, Sharangovich scored his first NHL goal against the Boston Bruins' Jaroslav Halák. The goal was the overtime winner in a 2–1 Devils win. During the 2021–22 season, on April 2, 2022, Sharangovich scored his first hat trick against the Florida Panthers. At the completion of his entry-level contract with the Devils, Sharangovich as a restricted free agent, was traded along with 2023 third-round draft pick to the Calgary Flames in exchange for Tyler Toffoli on 27 June 2023. He was promptly signed to a two-year, $6.2 million contract extension with the Flames the following day on 28 June. Sharangovich has played internationally at the junior and senior level for the Belarusian national team, which he currently captains. He participated at the 2017 IIHF World Championship and later the 2018 IIHF World Championship. "Devils sign forward Yegor Sharangovich to entry-level contract". National Hockey League. 25 July 2018.
