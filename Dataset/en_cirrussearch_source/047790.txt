Johann Ernst Glück (Latvian: Johans Ernsts Gliks; 10 November 1652 – 5 May 1705) was a German translator and Lutheran theologian active in Livonia, which is now in Latvia. Glück was born in Wettin as the son of a pastor. After attending the Latin school of Altenburg, he studied theology, rhetoric, philosophy, geometry, history, geography, and Latin at Wittenberg and Jena. Glück is known for being the first one to translate the Bible into Latvian, a project which he finished in 1694. It was carried out in its entirety in Marienburg (Alūksne) in Livonia, in the building which now houses the Ernst Glück Bible Museum, established to honour his work. He also founded the first Latvian language schools in Livonia in 1683. He died in Moscow. He had four daughters, a son (Ernst Gottlieb Glück), and a foster-daughter Marta Skowrońska who married Peter I and is mainly known as Catherine I. From 1725 until 1727 she was empress of the Russian Empire. Rožkalne, Anita; LU literatūras; folkloras un mākslas institūts (2003). Latviešu rakstniecība biogrāfijās (in Latvian). Riga: Zinātne.
