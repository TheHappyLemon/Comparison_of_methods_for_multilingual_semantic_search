Krasnohrad (Ukrainian: Красногра́д, IPA: [krɐsnoˈɦrɑd]), also known as Krasnograd is a city in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine. From 1784 to 1922, it was known as Kostiantynohrad or Konstantingrad. It serves as the administrative center of Krasnohrad Raion. Krasnohrad hosts the administration of Krasnohrad urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. In 2022, the population was estimated to be 19,674 (2022 estimate). The city of Krasnohrad was founded as a Bilevska fortress in 1731–1733, as part of the Ukrainian line defence fortifications, which ran from the Dnieper to the Donets. In 1784, the fortress was renamed Kostyantynohrad after/in honour of Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich of Russia. In 1797, it received city status. In 1922, Kostyantynohrad was renamed Krasnohrad during a "de-imperialization" drive carried out by the Soviet Union. In 2023 the working group of the National Commission on State Language Standards [uk] included Krasnohrad in the list of settlements in Ukraine that contain words with the root "krasn" ("red", the national colour of the Soviet Union) and can be renamed as part of decommunization derussification campaigns in Ukraine. Late August 2023 the Krasnohrad City Council initiated a public voting on renaming the city. It is located on the Berestova River 101 kilometres (63 mi) to the south of the city of Kharkiv. In 2021 about 20,000 people lived in the city.
