Oleg (Latvian: Oļegs) is a 2019 Latvian drama film directed by Juris Kursietis. It was screened in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Oleg (Oļegs) is a non-citizen of Latvia of Russian origin and a butcher by profession, who searches for a better life by working in a Belgian meat factory. However, his status makes it difficult to make a profit, and after he loses his job, Oleg becomes dependent on migrant workers, who are a part of the local Polish mafia. When the seemingly lowest point in his life has been reached, he finds enough strength to bounce back and forces himself to make a decision to flee, which at first seems impossible. The story is reportedly based on real events. Valentin Novopolskij as Oleg Dawid Ogrodnik as Andrzej Anna Próchniak as Malgosia Oleg won the Grand Prix, National Competition, at the 2019 Brussels International Film Festival (BRIFF).
