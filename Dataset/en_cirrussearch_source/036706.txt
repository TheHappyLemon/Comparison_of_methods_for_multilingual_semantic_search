Istra rolling hills (Latvian: Istras pauguraine) is nature park in Istra Parish, Ludza Municipality, Latgale, Latvia. The landscape protection area Istra rolling hills is located between Lake Šķaune and Lake Maroksna in Latgale upland and Rāznava hills. This conservation area was first established in 1977 and measured only 340 ha at that time. It was created to protect the more forested part of the landscape with articulated terrain, pines, spruces and broad-leaved forests, a significant part of which are excessively moist European alder forests. Now the protected area extends to the eastern shores of Lake Škaune.
