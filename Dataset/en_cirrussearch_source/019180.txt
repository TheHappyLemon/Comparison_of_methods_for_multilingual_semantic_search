Club Atlético River Plate, commonly known as River Plate, is an Argentine professional sports club based in the Belgrano neighborhood of Buenos Aires. Founded in 1901, the club is named after the English name for the city's estuary, Río de la Plata. River's home stadium, Estadio Monumental, is the largest in South America. Although a multi-sport club, River Plate is best known for its professional association football department, which has won Argentina's Primera División championship a record 38 times, most recently in 2023. River Plate have also won 16 national cups, making River Argentina's most successful team in domestic competitions with 54 titles. At international level, River have won 18 titles, including four Copa Libertadores, one Intercontinental Cup, one Supercopa Sudamericana, one Copa Sudamericana, three Recopa Sudamericanas, one Copa Interamericana, one Suruga Bank Championship, a record five Copa Aldaos, and one Tie Cup. In addition, River Plate's reserve team won the U-20 Copa Libertadores in 2012. After winning the 2014 Copa Sudamericana, 2015 Recopa Sudamericana and the 2015 Copa Libertadores, River Plate became the first team to simultaneously hold CONMEBOL's three current major international competitions. River Plate are ranked first in the all-time Argentine Primera División table, having gained the most points, having played the most matches, and having the highest win percentage. River are also ranked first in the historical table of the Copa Libertadores, being the South American team with most games won and the most points gained. The club were placed ninth in the FIFA Club of the Century poll in 2000. In a survey published by the Argentine Football Association in 2016, 6 out of 11 players of the all-time greatest Argentina national team had played for River Plate. River have a fierce rivalry with Boca Juniors. Matches between them are known as Superclásico, and the rivalry is among the most heated in the sport, due to the fixture's global popularity and both clubs having the most fans in Argentina. Notable players who have played for River include José Manuel Moreno, Adolfo Pedernera, Ángel Labruna, Amadeo Carrizo, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Omar Sívori, Daniel Passarella, Enzo Francescoli, Hernán Crespo, Javier Mascherano and Gonzalo Higuaín. According with the club's official history, River Plate was founded on 25 May 1901, close to the La Boca neighborhood (later the home of fierce rivals Boca Juniors). They were formed from the merger of two clubs, "Santa Rosa" and "La Rosales", with Leopoldo Bard elected as the first president. The name River Plate was chosen because of an incident during the construction of Buenos Aires Port: one of the members had seen how the workers of Dique nº 3 left their duties for a while to play a football match. The boxes they were working with just said "The River Plate" (the name the English gave to the Río de la Plata) and that inscription was taken to name the new club. River Plate affiliated to the Argentine Football Association in 1905, debuting in the third division against Facultad de Medicina. On 13 December 1908, the team was promoted to first division after beating Racing Club 2–1. However, the match was declared null due to River supporters jumping onto the field to celebrate with the players, so a new match had to be played. River again won, this time 7–0, to achieve promotion. In 1914 River won its first domestic championship, the Copa de Competencia Jockey Club and its first international title, the Copa de Competencia Chevallier Boutell. The nickname Los Millonarios came after the acquisition of winger Carlos Peucelle in 1931 for $10,000 and Bernabé Ferreyra for $35,000 (Large sum of money for the period) in 1932. In the following years, River Plate consolidated its place as one of the most popular teams of Argentina, and the 20th century brought much success. The club's record of 28 official tournaments saw them dubbed El Campeón del Siglo (The Champions of the Century). Wikimedia Commons has media related to River Plate kits. Notes There are different versions about the origin of the red band; some state that it was first worn during a carnival celebration while other say that River Plate adopted the band to distinguish themselves from a team of Villa Devoto that also had white jerseys. This jersey, worn as the home kit until 1932, has remained (with few exceptions) as the away kit In March 1932, president of the club, Antonio Liberti, reissued the red band jersey, after he came to the changing room and said to players: "Take care of it, boys, because this is the River Plate jersey". Adidas has been River Plate's uniform supplier since 1982, becoming one of the company's largest sponsorship deals in the world, only behind German club Bayern Munich. The US$60 million partnership with the German sports company signed in 2015 (extending the deal to 2021) marked the most expensive kit agreement in the history of Argentine football. Wikimedia Commons has media related to River Plate logos. As in many football shirts and sports in general, the team's jersey has a badge on its front, as a symbol of the institution. When the River Plate jersey was created it did not have a badge, and its presence varied throughout the history, according to the designs of each era. Currently it is embroidered on the jersey, with three colors (red, white and black). Its format resembles that of the jersey, as it has a red stripe that crosses it, along with the acronym of the club (CARP) in black, and the background is white, in a stylized design. When Hugo Santilli became chairman in 1984, he soon called to a competition where a new emblem would be chosen. The main objective of this new image was to eradicate the nickname Gallinas (Hens) that River's rivals (Boca Juniors fans mainly) used to mock them. Artists from Argentina took part in that competition. The club finally chose a logo designed by the artist Caloi. This emblem showed the figure of a lion (wearing a River jersey) rising from the Monumental stadium. The lion logo was immediately added to the uniforms (on the field and training clothes) having River Plate won the Copa Libertadores de América and European/South American Cup using the lion logo. In 1989, when Santilli left the club so the lion went with him and has not been reestablished since. In February 2022, River Plate launched its new corporate image, which included an update to the logo and a typography designed exclusively for the club. The corporate image was created and developed by "Grupo Berro", a branding and design studio that had been working on the corporate image for over two years. River Plate and Boca Juniors are the two largest football clubs in Argentina, with more than half the country's football fans supporting the clubs. Due to the rivalry between them, the Boca Juniors vs River Plate Superclásico local derby match was listed by the BBC as one of the most famous derbies in the world. Attending the match was also acclaimed in 2004 as the number one of the Fifty sporting things you must do before you die by The Observer newspaper. The "River Plate" name was chosen in 1901, when the team was still located at the La Boca neighbourhood, next to the Río de la Plata ("River Plate" in some English sources). Proposed names as "Club Atlético Forward", "Juventud Boquense" or "La Rosales" had been rejected. Pedro Martínez saw the name "The River Plate" written at ship containers, and proposed it as a name, which was finally accepted as the official name. River fans and the press are fond of the nickname Los Millonarios (The Millionaires). This name derives from the 1930s after some expensive transfers of players from other clubs, including Carlos Peucelle from Sportivo Buenos Aires in 1931 and Bernabé Ferreyra from Tigre in 1932. Due to the red band in their shirt, it is also common to refer to River as El Equipo de la Banda (the team with the band) or simply La Banda (which means "the stripe", but can also mean "the band" -both as in "gang" and "musical group"). River Plate's forwards between 1941 and 1946 were given the nickname La Máquina (The Machine), due to their synchronization and movements on the field. There was also a River Plate team that was known as La Maquinita (The Little Machine, as tribute to its predecessor) in the 1950s. Managed by José María Minella, the team earned the nickname after winning five championships in six years (1952–57). Some notable players were Alfredo Di Stéfano, Santiago Vernazza, Walter Gómez, Enrique Omar Sívori, among others. Some members of the original Máquina of the 1940s such as Labruna and Loustau, were also part of the team. The Estadio Antonio Liberti (nicknamed El Monumental) located in the Belgrano neighborhood of Buenos Aires is River Plate's stadium. With a capacity of 86,000, it was inaugurated on 25 May 1938. Argentina national football team usually plays its home games at the stadium. Since its establishment in 1901, River Plate's stadiums have been: Dársena Sur (1901–05, 1907–15): Located on the corner of Wenceslao Villafañe and Caboto streets of La Boca. The club returned in 1907 from Sarandí. Sarandí (1906–07): The club moved to that district in Greater Buenos Aires, near the railway station. La Boca (1915–23): River built a stadium on the corner of Pinzón and Gaboto streets in La Boca. Alvear y Tagle (1923–37): Located in the Recoleta district of Buenos Aires. The land where the stadium was built had been owned by Juan Manuel de Rosas. Antonio V. Liberti (Monumental) (1938–Present): Built on the same land where the Bajo Belgrano Horse Racing Track had existed years ago. In 2016 a research from a European sport marketing agency about the football teams with more members in the world, River Plate was in sixth position, with 123,665 members, the highest in the Americas. The ranking was led by Barcelona of Spain and Benfica of Portugal. In another ranking made in 2018 by the Bundesliga about the football clubs with more members, River Plate also appear in the sixth position, but this time with 146,000 members, surpassing clubs like FC Barcelona, Real Madrid CF and Manchester United F.C. among other football world powers. In one of the latest rankings in early 2023, River placed in fourth place in the world with 281,217 members, which is second in Argentina and also second in South America. On 8 October 2012, "The world's longest football flag" was unveiled in a caravan in which approximately 15,000 supporters took part. It was made entirely by fans who carried the 7,830 meters flag along the streets of Buenos Aires. The away jersey of the 2012–13 season was the most sold throughout the world during the month of September 2012, an achievement that had not reached any Argentine team. In 2015, the club participated in the FIFA Club World Cup and played against Sanfrecce Hiroshima at the Nagai Stadium in Osaka on 16 December, and on 20 December in the final against FC Barcelona at the International Stadium Yokohama. The number of River Plate supporters who traveled to Japan during that period were between 15,000 and 20,000, a record in the competition. River Plate has official subsidiaries in provinces such as Santa Fe, Tucumán, Córdoba, Entre Ríos, Mendoza, Tierra del Fuego, Catamarca, among others, and in Spain, Mexico, Australia, the United States, Paraguay and Canada. There are also unofficial fan clubs in all Latin American countries, and also in Spain, Italy, England, Israel, Australia, Germany, the United States and New Zealand.

At the end of the season, both teams played the "Copa de Oro", a single match won by River. In its Memoria y Balance (Annual Report) published by the AFA that year, River Plate is mentioned as "1936 Champion" while San Lorenzo is only mentioned as "Copa de honor winning team". In its 100th anniversary book published in 1993, the AFA listed River Plate as the only 1936 champion. In 2013, the AFA included three 1936 championships on its website, mentioning River Plate as Copa de Oro and Copa Campeonato winner and San Lorenzo as Copa de Honor winner, therefore both clubs added one league title to their honours. Moreover, some historians consider Copa de Oro a national cup instead of a league championship, stating that it was only contested to qualify an Argentine representative to play the Copa Aldao against the Uruguayan champion. Title shared ex aequo with Liga Cultural de Santiago del Estero.

The draft to form the best team in the country was led by Professor Rodolfo Sacco and had the best results that had never been achieved in the institution. The team began to form from a contractual relationship with the swimmer José Meolans, one of the Argentine swimmers with most titles won. Many high-level swimmers, trained in other institutions began to approach to be part of what would be the best team in the country for the coming years.

List of world champion football clubs This was set as the official date of foundation by the club itselft, stating that River Plate was established after the merger of clubs La Rosales and Santa Rosa. Nevertheless, other sources say that the real date of foundation is 15 May 1904 as River Plate would have assumed the date of foundation of predecessor club La Rosales as their own birth. This version is supported by historians whom found evidence of recorded matches played by both, La Rosales and Santa Rosa, after 1901. Moreover, La Nación newspaper published an article on 22 May 1904 about the "recent foundation" of River Plate. Grady, Daniel (2014). Mario Yepes. Mason Crest. p. 15. ISBN 978-1-4222-9154-2.
