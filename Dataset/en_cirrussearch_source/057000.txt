Cricova (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈkrikova]) is a Moldovan town, located 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) north of Chișinău, the capital of the country. Cricova is famous for its wine cellars, which make it a popular attraction for tourists. The town's population is 9,878 (as of 2004), of which 7,651 are ethnic Moldavians, 788 Ukrainians, 1,123 Russians, 82 Gagauzians, 74 Bulgarians, 6 Jews, 2 Poles, 29 Gypsies, and 123 other/non-declared. Cricova lies near the river Ichel, which goes into the Nistru river, which supplies Chișinău with water. The water from Ichel is not used in Cricova. In the northern part of the river is situated a lake (which is near the entrance to the Cricova wine cellars), which was generally used either for fishing or entertainment. Near the town are some mines, used for limestone extraction, some of them are older than 50 years. The town of Cricova was first recorded on July 31, 1431, with the name- "Vadul-Pietrei" ("Stone Ford"). Later the name "Cricău" appears in Zamfir Arbore's geographical calendar, over time turning into Cricova. Cricova is famous for its underground labyrinths. The greatest part of Cricova’s wine production facilities is placed underground, at a depth of 60-80 meters, creating a huge underground wine city with avenues, streets and broadways. These labyrinths offer a unique, favorable microclimate that gives typicity to the wines. All year round, the naturally constant temperature there remains at +12° to +14°C, and the humidity at about 97 per cent to 98 per cent, the most propitious conditions for developing and aging fine wines. By adopting Law No. 322-XV of 18.07.2003 on the Declaration of the Complex “Combinatul de Vinuri “Cricova” S.A.,” an Object of the National-Cultural Heritage of the Republic of Moldova, the Parliament created a special regime for the use of the geographical indication Cricova for wine.
