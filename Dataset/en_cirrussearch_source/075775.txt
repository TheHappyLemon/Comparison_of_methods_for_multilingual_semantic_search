Cēsis District (Latvian: Cēsu rajons) was an administrative division of Latvia, located in the Vidzeme region, in the country's north-east. It bordered the former districts of Valmiera and Valka to the north, Limbaži and Riga to the west, Gulbene to the east, Ogre and Madona to the south. It was organized into two cities, a municipality and twenty one parishes, each with a local government authority. The center of the district was the city of Cēsis. Districts were eliminated during the administrative-territorial reform in 2009.
