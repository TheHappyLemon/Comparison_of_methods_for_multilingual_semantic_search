Taijo Teniste (born 31 January 1988) is an Estonian professional footballer who plays as a right back for Estonian Meistriliiga club Tartu Tammeka and the Estonia national team. Teniste came through the Spordiklubi 10 youth academy and played for the club's first team in the IV liiga. In January 2005, Teniste signed for Levadia. He made his debut in the Meistriliiga on 3 April 2005, in a 4–0 home victory over Merkuur Tartu. Teniste helped Levadia win four successive Meistriliiga titles in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. On 4 July 2011, Teniste joined League Two side Swindon Town for a trial, but was not offered a contract as manager Paolo Di Canio felt Teniste was not a natural left back. On 1 September 2011, Teniste joined Norwegian club Sogndal on loan until the end of the season, with the option to make the deal permanent. He made his debut in the Tippeligaen on 11 September, in a 0–0 home draw against Aalesund, coming on as a substitute for Ole Jørgen Halvorsen in injury time. On 23 December 2011, Teniste signed a two-year contract with Sogndal. His contract was subsequently extended to 2015 and then to 2017. Teniste scored his first goal for Sogndal on 26 November 2017, in a 5–2 home win over Vålerenga in the last match of the 2017 season. On 14 August 2017, it was announced that Teniste would join Brann after the 2017 season on a three-year deal. Teniste has represented Estonia at under-17, under-18, under-19, under-21 and under-23 levels. Teniste made his senior international debut for Estonia on 9 November 2007, replacing Urmas Rooba in the 70th minute of a 0–2 away loss to Saudi Arabia in a friendly.
