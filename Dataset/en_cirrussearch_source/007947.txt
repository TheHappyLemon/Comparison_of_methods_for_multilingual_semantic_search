Brandon Hunter (November 24, 1980 – September 12, 2023) was an American professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). After a college basketball career with the Ohio Bobcats, leading the NCAA in rebounding in 2002–03, he was selected by the Boston Celtics in the second round of the 2003 NBA draft. After playing one season apiece for the Celtics and the Orlando Magic in the NBA, he started a journeyman playing career, mostly in Europe. Hunter attended Withrow High School in his hometown of Cincinnati. With the Tigers he averaged 13 points and 11 rebounds as they reached the state semifinals during his junior year. He committed to Ohio, playing in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) of the NCAA Division I, prior to his senior year. In 2017, Brandon was inducted into the Withrow Athletic Hall of Fame with Xavier product and NBA standout Tyrone Hill, Horace Pumphrey (football), Joe Brefeld (baseball, basketball, football) and Skyler Willis (volleyball, track).

Playing more than nearly 33 minutes per game (first for the team) during his sophomore year, he finished in the conference top five for scoring (18.1 ppg) and rebounding (9.4 rpg, 23rd in nation). Good performances in the MAC tournament, including a record 32 free throw attempts in three games, led to a selection to the All-Tournament Team, also making the 2001 All-MAC First Team. His junior season provided similar numbers, again leading the team in minutes, scoring (17.3 ppg) and rebounding (9.1 rpg, 41st in nation), with a successive All-MAC First Team selection.

Hunter added 21.5 points, 2.6 assists, 1.2 blocks and 0.8 steals on average, also leading the nation in doubles-doubles (24).
