Ainaži Lighthouse (Latvian: Ainažu bāka) is a lighthouse located in Ainaži on the Bay of Riga - of the Baltic Sea. The Ainahi lighthouse was built in 1930, originally serving as a guide for the nearby Ainaži port and harbour. During World War II, the harbour was bombarded by German bombers; causing the village to lose its processing factory and fishing importance - therefore making the lighthouse insignificant. The village, port and harbour were rebuilt under Soviet control - bringing back the importance of the lighthouse. The lighthouse was reconstructed and furthermore renovated in the 1990s. Currently the lighthouse is a key landmark for the nearby villages. List of lighthouses in Latvia "Tourism in the North-Central Regions". Latvia Travel (Official).
