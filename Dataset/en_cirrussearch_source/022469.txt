Hermippe /hɜːrˈmɪpiː/, or Jupiter XXX, is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered concurrently with Eurydome by a team of astronomers from the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Hawaii led by David Jewitt and Scott S. Sheppard and Jan Kleyna in 2001, and given the temporary designation S/2001 J 3. Hermippe is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 21,500,000 kilometers in about 630 days, at an inclination of 151° to the ecliptic (149° to Jupiter's equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.2290. It was named in August 2003 by the IAU, after Hermippe, a lover of Zeus (Jupiter). Hermippe belongs to the Ananke group, retrograde irregular moons which orbit Jupiter between 19.3 and 22.7 gigametres (0.152 astronomical units), at inclinations of roughly 150°.
