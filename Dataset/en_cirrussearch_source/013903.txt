Altentreptow (German pronunciation: [altənˈtʁeːpto] ) is a town in the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte district, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. It is situated on the river Tollense in Western Pomerania, 15 km north of Neubrandenburg. Until 1939 the city's name was Treptow an der Tollense. The origins of the town go back to a Slavic settlement that grew up around a fortress located on a small hill, where the town church lies today. The name Treptow is mentioned for the first time in 1175, in reference to the establishment of a monastery on the site, which however later moved to Verchen. The present town was most probably founded in the early 13th century, and is referred to as a "civitas", i.e. Latin for "city", in 1245. In 1282, a document confirms that the town was ruled by Lübeck law. The medieval town had three churches, of which only one survives, as well as a medieval hospital and a system of double defensive walls built before 1360. The town has suffered much destruction through fire and war during the centuries, and in 1743 the town walls were almost completely removed. Two city gates from c. 1450 still survive; the Brandenburger Torturm and the Deminner Torturm. Of the latter, only the ground floor remains, with additions and alterations made in the 19th century.
