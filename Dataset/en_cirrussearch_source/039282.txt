The 2017 Prudential RideLondon–Surrey Classic was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 30 July in London, England. It was the sixth edition of the London–Surrey Classic and was the twenty-eighth event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. It was the race's first appearance on the World Tour calendar. The race was won in a sprint finish by Norway's Alexander Kristoff, riding for Team Katusha–Alpecin. As a new event to the UCI World Tour, all UCI WorldTeams were invited to the race, but not obligated to compete in the race. As such, fourteen of the eighteen WorldTeams elected to compete. Eight UCI Professional Continental teams competed, and thus completed the 22-team peloton.
