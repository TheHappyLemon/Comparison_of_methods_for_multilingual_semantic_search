Guyana is divided into 10 regions: Each Region is administered by a Regional Democratic Council (RDC) which is headed by a Chairman. The Regions are divided into neighbourhood councils, known as Neighbourhood Democratic Councils (NDCs). The current regional structure was established by the Local Democratic Organs Act in 1980. The hyphenated names indicate the name of the rivers that define their border.
