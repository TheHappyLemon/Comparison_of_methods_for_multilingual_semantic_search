Linden Vey (born July 17, 1991) is a Canadian professional ice hockey right winger currently playing for Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). Vey previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Calgary Flames, Vancouver Canucks and the Los Angeles Kings, the latter of which drafted him in the fourth round, 96th overall, in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. On June 28, 2014, Vey was traded by the Los Angeles Kings to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for a second-round pick at the 2014 NHL Entry Draft (ultimately used to select Roland McKeown). He scored his first NHL goal on October 11, 2014, against Viktor Fasth of the Edmonton Oilers. On October 5, 2015, Vey was placed on waivers by the Canucks. He cleared waivers the following day and was assigned to the Utica Comets of the American Hockey League (AHL). On July 5, 2016, Vey signed a one-year, two-way deal as a free agent with the Calgary Flames. Vey was assigned to Calgary's AHL affiliate, the Stockton Heat, to begin the 2016–17 season. As the team's top scorer, he scored 55 points in 61 games but was limited to just four scoreless games in his recall to the Flames. On July 2, 2017, Vey signed a contract abroad, agreeing to a one-year deal with Kazakh-based club Barys Astana of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Despite scoring 52 points in 50 games, Barys Astana missed the playoffs. As a result, Vey was granted his release and signed with ZSC Lions of the Swiss National League (NL) on January 18, 2018. He played out the remainder of the season with the Lions, helping retain the Swiss championship. On May 3, 2018, Vey opted to return to the KHL, signing a two-year contract as a free agent with CSKA Moscow. In his first season with CSKA, Vey contributed with 31 assists and 43 points in 56 regular season games. He compiled 10 points in 18 playoff games to help CSKA claim the Gagarin Cup. At the conclusion of his contract with CSKA, Vey signed as a free agent to a two-year contract with SKA Saint Petersburg, on May 16, 2020. On May 5, 2023, Vey left Astana and the KHL at the conclusion of his contract and signed a one-year contract with German club, Adler Mannheim of the DEL. During the 2017–18 season, Vey was selected to represent Canada at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Used in a depth role, Vey contributed with one assist in six games to help Canada claim the bronze medal. On June 5, 2016, Vey's father, Curtis and his mistress, Angela Nicholson, were convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. The targets of the plot were Vey's mother, Brigitte, as well as Nicholson's husband. They were acquitted after a retrial in May 2019. "Linden Vey acquired by Canucks". CBC Sports. June 28, 2014.
