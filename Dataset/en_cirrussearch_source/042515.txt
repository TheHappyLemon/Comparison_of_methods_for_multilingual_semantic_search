Wagner is derived from the Germanic surname Waganari, meaning 'wagonmaker' or 'wagon driver'. The Wagner surname is German. The name is also well-established in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, eastern Europe, and elsewhere as well as in all German-speaking countries, and among Ashkenazi Jews. The Wagner surname was first found in Saxony, where the family became a prominent contributor to the development of the area from ancient times. The alternatively spelled surname Wegner has its origin in Silesia. This common occupational surname was often given to one who transported produce or other goods via high-sided wagons or carts. Among some German populations, especially the Pennsylvania Germans, Wagner also denoted a wagon-maker, wainwright, or cartwright.
