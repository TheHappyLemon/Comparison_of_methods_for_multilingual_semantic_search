Acer Inc. (/ˈeɪsər/; AY-sər) is a Taiwanese multinational company that produces computer hardware and electronics, headquartered in Xizhi, New Taipei City. Its products include desktop PCs, laptop PCs (clamshells, 2-in-1s, convertibles and Chromebooks), tablets, servers, storage devices, virtual reality devices, displays, smartphones and peripherals, as well as gaming PCs and accessories under its Predator brand. As of 2024,[update] Acer is the world's sixth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales. In the early 2000s, Acer implemented a new business model, shifting from a manufacturer to a designer, marketer, and distributor of products, while performing production processes via contract manufacturers. Currently, in addition to its core IT products business, Acer also has a new business entity that focuses on the integration of cloud services and platforms, and the development of smartphones and wearable devices with value-added IoT applications. Acer was founded in 1976 by Stan Shih (Chinese: 施振榮), his wife Carolyn Yeh, and five others as Multitech in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. The company began with eleven employees and US$25,000 in capital. Initially, it was primarily a distributor of electronic parts and a consultant in the use of microprocessor technologies. It produced the Micro-Professor MPF-I training kit, then two Apple II clones–the Microprofessor II and III–before joining the emerging IBM PC compatible market and becoming a significant PC manufacturer. The company was renamed Acer in 1987. In 1998, Acer reorganized into five groups: Acer International Service Group, Acer Sertek Service Group, Acer Semiconductor Group, Acer Information Products Group, and Acer Peripherals Group. To dispel complaints from clients that Acer competed with its own products and to alleviate the competitive nature of the branded sales versus contract manufacturing businesses, the company spun off the contract business in 2000, renaming it Wistron Corporation. The restructuring resulted in two primary units: brand name sales and contract manufacturing. In 2001, the company sold its manufacturing units BenQ and Wistron in order to focus resources on design and sales. Acer increased worldwide sales while simultaneously reducing its labor force by identifying and using marketing strategies that best utilized their existing distribution channels. In January 2005 Gianfranco Lanci [zh] became the president. By 2005, Acer employed a scant 7,800 people worldwide. Revenues rose from US$4.9 billion in 2003 to US$11.31 billion in 2006. Acer's North American market shares slipped in the early 2000s, while its European market shares rose. In the mid-2000s, consumer notebooks were almost the sole growth drivers for the PC industry, and Acer's exceptionally low overheads and dedication to the channel made it one of the main beneficiaries of this trend. Acer grew quickly in Europe in part by embracing the use of more traditional distribution channels targeting retail consumers when some rivals were pursuing online sales and business customers. In 2007, Acer bought Gateway in the United States and Packard Bell in Europe, and became the third-largest provider of computers and the second largest for notebooks, achieving significant improvement in profitability. Acer has strived to become the world's largest PC vendor in the belief that the goal can help it achieve economy of scale and garner higher margin. However, such a reliance on the high-volume, low-value PC market made Acer exposed when buying habits changed. In September 2018, Acer spun-off its smart gadget unit GadgeTek Inc., which produces Leap Beads, smart prayer beads that track mantras and footsteps. In 2019, Acer announced the esports social platform PLANET9.gg, which aims to provide game analytics, community-organized competitions, and social experiences. In November 2013, chairman and CEO J.T. Wang and president Jim Wong both resigned due to the company's poor financial performance. Wang had been reportedly due to leave Acer at the end of the year and was supposed to have been succeeded by Wong. Acer co-founder Stan Shih took over as board chairman and interim president after the departure of Wang and Wong and began to search for new candidates to assume the roles of CEO and president. On 23 December, Acer named Jason Chen, then the vice president of worldwide sales and marketing at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, as its new president and CEO, effective 1 January. In 1988, Acer acquired Counterpoint Computers. In 1990, Acer acquired Altos Computer Corporation. In 1993, Acer acquired the PC division of Commodore International. In 1997, Acer acquired Texas Instruments notebook computer business. On 27 August 2007, Acer announced plans to acquire its US-based rival Gateway, Inc. for US$710 million. Acer's former chairman, J.T. Wang, stated that the acquisition completed Acer's "global footprint, by strengthening [its] United States presence". Included in this acquisition was the eMachines brand. In January 2008, Acer announced that it had acquired a controlling interest of 75% of Packard Bell. In March 2008, Acer acquired Taiwanese electronics manufacturing company E-TEN. In 2009, Acer acquired 29.9% of Italian computer system manufacturer Olidata. In August 2010, Acer and Founder Technology signed a memorandum of mutual understanding to strengthen their long-term PC business cooperation. In July 2011, Acer bought iGware Inc. (formally BroadOn) for US$320 million. The aim is to create Acer Cloud to enter cloud computing market. iGware had developed cloud software and infrastructure tools for devices.

In 2016, Acer acquired wireless pet camera maker Pawbo. In 2017, Acer became the largest corporate shareholder of AOPEN Inc. In October 2017, Acer purchased a 66.7% majority stake in StarVR from Starbreeze. In 2019, Acer and Ubisoft teamed up for the Rainbow Six Pro League and other major esports events with the Predator brand as the PC and monitor sponsor. As of September 2022, Acer has over 7,713 employees worldwide, operating in 40 countries/territories. Acer Computer Australia (ACA) was established in 1990, and is currently Australia's third-largest personal computer vendor, behind Hewlett-Packard Australia and Dell Australia and New Zealand.

Aazar eMachines ProPack Gateway Packard Bell Pawbo Predator Xplova Nitro In 2005, Acer published its first environmental report, for which the company used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines. All of Acer's tier-one suppliers have acquired ISO 14001 certification. In November 2012, Acer was ranked 4th place out of 15 in Greenpeace's re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics, with a score of 5.1 points out of 10. The Guide ranks electronics makers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable. Greenpeace criticized the company for not setting out targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as intended in 2010 and for not providing external verification for the GHG emissions it reports for its operations and business travel. It also scored badly on the products criteria receiving no points on product lifecycle while Greenpeace noted that a higher percentage of its products need to meet or exceed Energy Star standards in order for it to score more points. It received some praise for launching new products which are free from Polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and the company informed Greenpeace that the majority of its products will be PVC/BFR free in the near future. Acer also scored well on chemical management for lobbying for restrictions on organo-halogens and was commended for reporting on GHG emissions from its first-tier suppliers and investigating its second tier. In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Acer the seventh highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Acer refused to join the international community and withdraw from the Russian market. Research from Yale University from March 28, 2022, identifying how companies were reacting to Russia's aggression identified Acer in the worst category "Digging in" meaning Defying Demands for Exit: companies defying demands for exit/reduction of activities. Acer subsequently reversed its decision and suspended business in Russia. Despite stating that it would suspend business in Russia, a Reuters investigation of customs data found that Acer supplied at least $70.4 million worth of computer hardware to Russia between April 8, 2022 and March 31, 2023, and it was supplied to Russia both through Acer's wholly-owned Swiss registered subsidiary. Since the shipments occurred outside Taiwan, they did not violate Taiwanese sanctions against Russia.
