Thomas Zebrowski (Lithuanian: Tomas Žebrauskas, Polish: Tomasz Żebrowski; November 24, 1714 in Samogitia – March 18, 1758 in Vilnius) was a Jesuit architect, mathematician, and astronomer. He was instrumental in establishing and funding the Observatory of Vilnius University. Marcin Odlanicki Poczobutt was among his students. Zebrowski studied philosophy and theology at Vilnius University. He briefly taught at Jesuit schools in Kražiai, Ilūkste, and Babruysk and prepared construction projects for churches in these towns. They displayed features of Baroque churches in Vilnius. He also designed the Jesuit school in Zhodishki [be], houses for nobles, and other buildings. Though documentary evidence is lacking, it is suspected that Zebrowski was also involved in construction of churches in Minsk and Płock, as well as the Oginski residence in Ručyca [be] (Hanuta) village. After studying at Charles University in Prague under Joseph Stepling in 1750–52, Zebrowski returned to Vilnius, becoming a popular lecturer of physics and astronomy at Vilnius University. He was also interested in geodesy, horology, mineralogy, geography. However, his major passion was astronomy and he pursued funding for an observatory. The construction was funded by Elżbieta Ogińska-Puzynina, while Mikolaj Radziwill and bishop Józef Sapieha donated 13.5-centimetre (5.3 in) and 10-centimetre (3.9 in) diameter reflector telescopes manufactured in Germany. Zebrowski designed the observatory; its construction began in 1753. Zubovas, Vladimiras (1985–1988). "Žebrauskas, Tomas". In Zinkus, Jonas; et al. (eds.).
