According to Belarusian toponymist Vadzim Žučkievič name "Hantsavichy" comes from surname Hantsavich. Before World War II, 60% of the population was Jewish. In the 1920s and 1930s there were four synagogues, a Jewish library, an orphanage, a Tarbut school and school in Yiddish. Under Polish administration, in 1939, the town was retaken by the Soviets and annexed to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. The German army arrived on June 29, 1941. German occupation of Hantsavichy lasted until 7 July 1944. From June 30 to July 1, 1941, a pogrom occurred in which 16 Jews were murdered.
