The University of Dhaka (Bengali: ঢাকা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়; also known as Dhaka University or DU) is a public research university located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It was established in 1921 as University of Dacca and it is the oldest active university in Bangladesh. The university was founded in 1921 under the Dacca University Act 1920 of the Indian Legislative Council. Nawab Bahadur Sir Khwaja Salimullah, who pioneered the university in Dhaka, donated 600 acres of land from his estate for this purpose. It is modeled after British Universities. Currently it is the largest public research university in Bangladesh, with a student body of 46,150 and a faculty of 1,992. It has made significant contributions to the modern history of Bangladesh. After the Partition of India, it became the focal point of progressive and democratic movements in Pakistan. Its students and teachers played a central role in the rise of Bengali nationalism and the independence of Bangladesh in 1971.[citation needed] Notable alumni include Satyendra Nath Bose, known for Bose–Einstein statistics and the theory of Bose–Einstein condensate, Muhammad Yunus (winner 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, pioneer of microcredit), Muhammad Shahidullah, Natyaguru Nurul Momen Pioneer of Cultural & theatric activities of Dhaka University (He was both a student of DU & later a teacher), Serajul Islam Choudhury (the country's leading public intellectual and writer), Mohammad Ataul Karim (physicist), Buddhadeb Bose (20th-century Bengali poet) and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (the founding father of Bangladesh but he never got any degree from DU).[citation needed] Before Dhaka University was established, near its grounds were the former buildings of Dhaka College affiliated to the University of Calcutta. In 1873 the college was relocated to Bahadur Shah Park. Later it shifted to Curzon Hall, which would become the first institute of the university. The establishment of the university was compensation for the annulment of the 1905 Partition of Bengal. The partition had established the Muslim majority Eastern Bengal and Assam as a separate province, with Dhaka as its capital. All India Muslim League, newly formed in Dhaka, wholeheartedly supported the move. However, the partition was abolished in 1911 due to severe opposition from Indian National Congress and Bengali Hindus. Deeply hurt by the decision of annulment of Bengal partition, a Muslim delegation led by Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur, the then Nawab of Dhaka demanded a university be set up in Dhaka. To appease the majority Muslim masses of East Bengal, Lord Curzon agreed and declared that a university as a center of excellence would be established in Dhaka. Nawab Sir Salimullah, who pioneered the university in Dhaka, donated 600 acres of land from his estate for this purpose. In 1913, public opinion was invented before the university scheme was given its final shape. The secretary of state approved it in December 1913. The first vice-chancellor of the university, Philip Joseph Hartog, formerly academic registrar of the University of London for 17 years was appointed. Established in 1921 under the Dacca University Act 1920 of the Indian Legislative Council, it is modeled after British universities.[citation needed] Lord Ronaldshay, Governor of Bengal between 1917 and 1922, was its first chancellor. He designated Nawaab Syed Shamsul Huda a life member of the university. On Huda's recommendation, Lord Ronaldshay appointed Ahmad Fazlur Rahman as a provost. Academic activities started on 1 July in 1921 with 847 students along with 3 faculties: Arts, Science and Law; 12 departments: Sanskrit and Bengali, English, Education, History, Arabic and Islamic Studies, Persian and Urdu, Philosophy, Economics and Politics, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Law; and 3 dormitories for students: Salimullah Muslim Hall, Dacca Hall and Jagannath Hall. In 1936, the university awarded honorary doctorate degrees to Jagadish Chandra Bose, Jadunath Sarkar, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, Allama Iqbal and Rabindranath Tagore. The university played a significant role in the Bengali Language Movement when Bengalis joined to fight against Urdu being the sole official language in East Pakistan. Dhaka University was the main place where the movement started with the students joining and protesting against the Pakistan Government. Later several students were killed where the Shaheed Minar stands today. After the incident, Bengali was restored as the official language. President's Order No. 11 of 1973 re-constitute and reorganized the University of Dhaka to improve the teaching and research provided and the administration after 1971 Independence war. Throughout this order, the word Dhaka was substituted for the word Dacca by section 2 of the University Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987 (Act No. XXXVI of 1987). There are 23 residence halls for the students and dormitories for the teachers as well as for the officials of the university. The University Library, housed in three separate buildings, is the biggest in Bangladesh. The library holds a collection of more than 617,000 volumes, including bound volumes of periodicals. In addition, it has a collection of over 30,000 manuscripts in other languages and a large number of microfilms, microfiche, and CDs. It subscribes to over 300 foreign journals.
