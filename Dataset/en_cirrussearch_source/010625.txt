This 1928 Summer Olympics medal table comprises two tables of countries ranked by the number of medals won during the 1928 Summer Olympics. The 1928 Summer Olympics were held in and around Amsterdam in the Netherlands from 17 May 1928 to 22 August 1928. A total of 2,883 athletes from 46 countries participated in the sports competition, in 14 sports and 109 events. Additionally, five art competitions were held with 13 events combined. 327 sports medals and 29 arts medals were awarded during the 1928 Summer Olympics. A total of 5,901 souvenir medals were given; 5,139 medals to contestants and officials, and 762 medals to persons that contributed to the Olympics by rendering their services. The souvenir medals are not displayed in the medal tables. The ranking of the sports competition is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee, although the committee does not officially recognize global ranking per country. For the 109 sports events a total of 327 medals were awarded: 110 gold medals, 108 silver medals, and 109 bronze medals. These numbers are unequal, because two gold medals and no silver medals were awarded in the lightweight category of weightlifting, after a first-place tie in the event. The athletes of 33 different countries won one or more medals. The most medals (56) and the most gold medals (22) were won by athletes from the United States. The countries are ranked by the number of gold medals won by the athletes of that country. If countries are tied, first the number of silver medals is taken into consideration and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically.   *   Host nation (Netherlands) Source: www.olympic.org The ranking of the 1928 arts competitions is based on the official report The Ninth Olympiad (1928) of the Dutch National Olympic Committee.

And also in music, no medals were awarded for compositions for song and composition for one instrument. The most medals (8) were won by contestants from Germany, the most gold medals (2) were won by contestants from the Netherlands.
