The FIA World Rallycross Championship (official abbreviation is World RX) is a rallycross series organised by the FIA in conjunction with series promoter Rallycross Promoter GmbH (founded by Red Bull and KW25). From the inaugural season in 2014 to 2020, IMG Motorsport fulfilled the role of promoter. Regular lap vs. Joker lap (2016 World RX of Norway) Cars line up on the grid before a Semi-Final Semi-Final 2 at the 2016 World RX of Portugal The series currently consists of 12 two-day events driven on closed circuits with mixed surface (mostly asphalt and gravel). Each event consists of: 4 Qualifying heats. In each of the 4 series there are smaller races containing 3 to 5 cars, and the driver with the fastest overall race time after 4 laps (including one Joker Lap) is declared the qualifying winner of Q1, Q2, Q3 and/or Q4. Drivers earn 'intermediate points' based on their positions. After the 4 qualifying series, the points are added up and the 12 drivers with the most points in the 'intermediate standings' move into the next round. 2 Semi-Finals. 6 cars race in each of both semi-finals, which are run over 6 laps (incl. one Joker Lap). The top 3 drivers in each semi-final move into the final round. Final. Like the semi-finals, this race is contested by 6 cars over 6 laps (incl. one Joker Lap). The winner of the final is deemed to be the event winner. However, the final winner has not necessarily claimed the most championship points from the whole event. During the first FIA World Rallycross Championship season in 2014, two classes were run, Supercar (later RX1) and the supporting RX Lites series (later RX2). RX Lites teams raced identical cars prepared by OlsbergsMSE. The World RX Championship series was introduced to distinguish it from the FIA European Rallycross Championship, which has been contested since 1976 and was renamed in March 2013. An electric category was planned to be introduced in 2020, but it was announced in August 2018 that the introduction of a fully electric Championship would be delayed until 2021 to allow manufacturers more time to submit an interest to join following the rules change. Instead, the Projekt E class was run in 2020 as a special parallel series using a spec racer. The Projekt E spec electric rallycross car was revealed in September 2019 at the Riga Motor Museum in Latvia. FIA announced in August 2020 that RX2e would be replacing the RX2 category for the 2021 season. The top World Rallycross Championship series switched to electric cars (RX1e) in August 2022, making World RX an all-electric race series. For 2022, there are two World Rallycross Championships and two European Rallycross Championships: FIA World Rallycross Championship, using cars from the RX1e class FIA Euro RX1 Rallycross Championship, using cars from the RX1 class FIA RX2e Rallycross Championship, using cars from the RX2e class FIA Euro RX3 Rallycross Championship, using cars from the RX3 class Notes Formerly Supercar, 2014–20 Exclusively contested in Euro RX Formerly RX Lites, 2014–16 Formerly Super 1600, 2001–10 The top-level RX1 Supercars division use 2.0 L, turbocharged, four-cylinder engines, which produce approximately 570–600 hp (430–450 kW), and between 620–680 lb⋅ft (840–920 N⋅m) of torque, while using a 45 mm (1.8 in) intake restrictor.: 5/41  The engines run 50 psi (3.4 bar) of boost pressure, and completely unrestricted, are capable of making about 1,000 hp (750 kW) and 1,100 lb⋅ft (1,500 N⋅m) of torque. They are four-wheel-drive, and use a Sadev 6-speed sequential gearbox. They use launch control, and are capable of accelerating from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in under 2 seconds; which is faster than a Formula One car. Fully prepared, the cars weigh about 1,300 kg (2,900 lb), including the driver, and with oil and fuel. The second-tier RX2 Supercar Lites division uses a 16-valve, 2.4 L, naturally aspirated, Ford Duratec inline-four engine, making between 310–320 hp (230–240 kW) and 300 N⋅m (220 lbf⋅ft) of torque. They are also four-wheel-drive, and also use a 6-speed sequential gearbox. They have a minimum weight of 1,100 kg (2,400 lb), including the driver. The RX3 (formerly Super 1600) class uses 1.6 L (1600 cc), naturally aspirated, four-cylinder engines; generating between 220–250 hp (160–190 kW) and between 190–200 N⋅m (140–150 lbf⋅ft) of torque. They are only two-wheel-drive (front-wheel-drive), and use either a 5- or 6-speed sequential gearbox. They weigh between 920–1,000 kg (2,030–2,200 lb) including the driver, depending on how many valves per cylinder the engine has. They are capable of a 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) time in just under 4.5 seconds. The top-level all-electric RX1e Supercar division uses two electric motors, each producing 340 hp (250 kW) and 440 N⋅m (320 lbf⋅ft) of torque; for a total of 680 hp (510 kW) and 880 N⋅m (650 lbf⋅ft) of instant torque. They are four-wheel-drive, weigh between 1,300–1,330 kg (2,870–2,930 lb), and can accelerate from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 1.8 seconds. The second-tier all-electric RX2e division uses two electric motors, each producing 167.5 hp (124.9 kW) and 255 N⋅m (188 lbf⋅ft) of torque; for a total of 335 hp (250 kW) and 510 N⋅m (380 lbf⋅ft) of torque. They are also four-wheel-drive, and weigh 1,290 kg (2,840 lb). Projekt E used electric powertrain kits supplied by STARD. The first car used a Ford Fiesta bodyshell; the STARD ElectRX was a three-motor, all-wheel drive car with 450 kW (600 hp) combined output.
