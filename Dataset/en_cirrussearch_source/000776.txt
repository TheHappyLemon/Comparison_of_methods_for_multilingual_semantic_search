Mu (/Ààm(j)uÀê/; uppercase Œú, lowercase Œº; Ancient Greek Œº·ø¶ [m≈∑Àê], Greek: ŒºŒπ or ŒºœÖ‚Äîboth [mi]) is the twelfth letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiced bilabial nasal IPA: [m]. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 40. Mu was derived from the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol for water, which had been simplified by the Phoenicians and named after their word for water, to become ê§åimg (mem). Letters that derive from mu include the Roman M and the Cyrillic –ú, though the lowercase resembles a small Latin U (u). In Greek, the name of the letter was written Œº·ø¶ and pronounced [m≈∑Àê]. In Modern Greek, the letter is spelled ŒºŒπ and pronounced [mi]. In polytonic orthography, it is written with an acute accent:¬†ŒºŒØ. The lowercase letter mu (Œº) is used as a special symbol in many academic fields. Uppercase mu is not used, because it appears identical to Latin M. "Œº" is used as a unit prefix denoting a factor of 10‚àí6 (one millionth), in this context, the symbol's name is "micro". Metric prefix International System of Units prefix, also known as "SI prefix" The micrometre with a symbol of "Œºm" can also be referred to as the non-SI term "micron". "Œº" is conventionally used to denote certain things; however, any Greek letter or other symbol may be used freely as a variable name. a measure in measure theory minimalization in computability theory and Recursion theory the integrating factor in ordinary differential equations the degree of membership in a fuzzy set the M√∂bius function in number theory the population mean or expected value in probability and statistics the Ramanujan‚ÄìSoldner constant In classical physics and engineering: the coefficient of friction (also used in aviation as braking coefficient (see Braking action)) reduced mass in the two-body problem Standard gravitational parameter in celestial mechanics linear density, or mass per unit length, in strings and other one-dimensional objects permeability in electromagnetism the magnetic dipole moment of a current-carrying coil dynamic viscosity in fluid mechanics the amplification factor or voltage gain of a triode vacuum tube the electrical mobility of a charged particle the rotor advance ratio, the ratio of aircraft airspeed to rotor-tip speed in rotorcraft the pore water pressure in saturated soil In particle physics: the elementary particles called the muon and antimuon the proton-to-electron mass ratio In thermodynamics: the chemical potential of a system or component of a system In evolutionary algorithms: Œº, population size from which in each generation Œª offspring will generate (the terms Œº and Œª originate from evolution strategy notation) In type theory: Used to introduce a recursive data type. For example, list(œÑ)=ŒºŒ±.1+œÑŒ±{\displaystyle {\text{list}}(\tau )=\mu {}\alpha {}.1+\tau {}\alpha } is the type of lists with elements of type œÑ{\displaystyle \tau } (a type variable): a sum of unit, representing nil, with a pair of a œÑ{\displaystyle \tau } and another list(œÑ){\displaystyle {\text{list}}(\tau )} (represented by Œ±{\displaystyle \alpha }). In this notation, Œº{\displaystyle \mu } is a binding form, where the variable (Œ±{\displaystyle \alpha }) introduced by Œº{\displaystyle \mu } is bound within the following term (1+œÑŒ±{\displaystyle 1+\tau {}\alpha }) to the term itself. Via substitution and arithmetic, the type expands to 1+œÑ+œÑ2+œÑ3+‚ãØ{\displaystyle 1+\tau +\tau ^{2}+\tau ^{3}+\cdots }, an infinite sum of ever-increasing products of œÑ{\displaystyle \tau } (that is, a œÑ¬†list{\displaystyle \tau {}{\text{ list}}} is any k{\displaystyle k}-tuple of values of type œÑ{\displaystyle \tau } for any k‚â•0{\displaystyle k\geq 0}). Another way to express the same type is list(œÑ)=1+œÑlist(œÑ){\displaystyle {\text{list}}(\tau )=1+\tau {}{\text{list}}(\tau )}.

The value of Œº is calculated by dividing the mass of the candidate body by the total mass of the other objects that share its orbital zone. Mu chord Electronic musician Mike Paradinas runs the label Planet Mu which utilizes the letter as its logo, and releases music under the pseudonym Œº-Ziq, pronounced "music" Used as the name of the school idol group Œº's, pronounced "muse", consisting of nine singing idols in the anime Love Live! School Idol Project Official fandom name of Kpop group f(x), appearing as either MeU or 'Œº' Hip-hop artist Muonboy has taken inspiration from the particle for his stage name and his first EP named Mu uses the letter as its title.
