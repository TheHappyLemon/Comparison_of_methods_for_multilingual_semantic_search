Herreys (Swedish pronunciation: [hɛˈrɛjs]), sometimes Herrey's or Herrey, is a Swedish pop group, consisting of the three brothers Per Herrey (born 9 August 1958), Richard Herrey (born 19 August 1964), and Louis Herrey (born 3 November 1966). They won the Eurovision Song Contest 1984 with the song "Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley". Richard and Louis Herrey became the first teenage males to win Eurovision and remain the youngest-ever male winners, being 19 years and 260 days and 17 years and 184 days of age, respectively. In 1985, they won the Sopot International Song Festival with "Sommarparty". At the time of their Eurovision win, the brothers were living and working as singers in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. Herreys continued to record and tour for a few years, but had no hits of the same magnitude as the Eurovision winner. They were the first European boyband preceding the international boom a few years later. Herreys was the bestselling pop group in Sweden in the 1980s, and enjoyed enormous success touring and performing in excess of 300 live shows. Herreys was also the first Western band to be invited to tour behind the Iron Curtain in the Soviet Union, and also did shows with the big Russian star Alla Pugacheva. The three brothers reunited to perform "Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley" in the intermission of one of the Swedish Melodifestivalen semifinals of 2002. Richard Herrey made an appearance at Congratulations, a 50th anniversary concert, held in Copenhagen, Denmark in October 2005. In February 2006, Richard Herrey released his first solo album, Jag e Kung. They performed at Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits, the 60th anniversary show in 2015. 1984: Diggi Loo, Diggi Ley 1985: Crazy People 1985: Not Funny 1986: Different I's 1987: Live in Tivoli 1994: Där vindarna möts 1995: Herreys Story 2002: Gyllene Hits 2010: The Greatest Hits "Crazy people" / "I'm so sorry" "You" / "I see the love" "Kall som is" / "Mirror mirror" (#18 in Sweden) (1984) "Diggi-Loo-Diggi-Ley" (1984) (#2 in Sweden, #5 in Norway, #10 in Switzerland, #11 in Germany, #18 in Denmark, #46 in UK) "People say it's in the air" / "I'm so sorry" "Varje liten droppe regn" (EP) (#11 in Sweden) "People from Ibiza" / "Sommarparty" (#20 in Sweden) "Din telefon" / "Why Why" "Chinese Temptation" / "Sweet Love" "Freedom" / "Little Pretty Girl" "Min ensamma vrå" / "Livet i dig" "Öppna dina ögon" / "Hanna" "Här vill jag leva" / "Hon ger dig allt" "Herrey's* - Diggi Loo, Diggi Ley Images", discogs.com.
