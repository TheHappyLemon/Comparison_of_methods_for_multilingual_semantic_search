The Lebanon men's national basketball team (Arabic: منتخب لبنان لكرة السلة; French: Équipe du Liban de basket-ball), controlled by the Lebanese Basketball Federation (FLB), has represented Lebanon in basketball since its inception in 1947. The squad is governed by FIBA, and is part of the FIBA Asia zone. Throughout its history, Lebanon has achieved success, finishing as runners-up in the FIBA Asia Cup on four occasions: 2001, 2005, 2007, and most recently in 2022. The team has also made appearances in the FIBA World Championship on four occasions (2002, 2006, 2010, and 2023) but haven't progressed beyond the preliminary round. Basketball arrived in Lebanon in the mid-1920s, initially introduced at the American University of Beirut. The official organization of basketball in the country began in 1949 with the establishment of the Lebanese Basketball Federation (French: Fédération Libanaise de Basketball). This period also saw the founding of the Lebanese Volleyball Federation, marking a key moment for Lebanese sports development. The early years of international competition for Lebanon involved a unique approach. The Soviet Union's refusal to host Eurobasket 1949 and FIBA Europe's decision not to ask Czechoslovakia to host consecutive tournaments led to Egypt, the Eurobasket 1947 bronze medalist, hosting the competition. Due to travel challenges and concerns, few European teams participated. In an unconventional move, Lebanon and Syria, both Asian countries, were invited to participate in this European championship. Making their Eurobasket 1949 debut, Lebanon finished in seventh place after losing all six games in the seven-team round-robin format. The team's second attempt at the European competition came at the Eurobasket 1953 in Moscow. During the preliminary rounds, Lebanon lost all four games, including one by forfeit due to their decision not to play against Israel. Their first victory in the tournament came against Sweden in the classification round, marking a significant milestone as Lebanon's first win in Eurobasket history. Placing fourth in their five-team group, Lebanon advanced to the 13–16 classification games. While they narrowly lost to West Germany (58–56), they secured a victory over Denmark (74–40), ultimately finishing 15th out of the 17 participating teams. Lebanon achieved notable results in the early 2000s, solidifying their presence in the Asian basketball landscape. They finished second at the 2001 ABC Championship after a 63–97 loss to China in the final. The tournament showcased the skills of Lebanon's guard, Walid Doumiati, who was awarded the tournament's Best Playmaker. Alongside him, forward Fadi El Khatib also earned a spot on the All-Star Five lineup. This silver medal secured Lebanon's participation in the 2002 FIBA World Championship, though their journey ended in the first round of the tournament. Lebanon repeated their performance by reaching the finals again at the 2005 FIBA Asia Championship. However, their attempt to win the championship was unsuccessful against China, with Lebanon losing 61–77. Fadi El Khatib's performance earned him recognition as the tournament's Best Forward. Additionally, center Joe Vogel also secured a spot in the All-Star Five lineup. Finishing as runners-up granted Lebanon a ticket to the 2006 FIBA World Championship. Although the team secured victories against Venezuela (82–72) and France (74–73), they narrowly missed qualifying for the round of 16 in the World Championship. The following year, Lebanon achieved second place for the third time at the 2007 FIBA Asia Championship, facing a 74–69 loss to Iran in the final. This loss prevented Lebanon from qualifying for the 2008 Summer Olympics. At the 2009 FIBA Asia Championship, Lebanon's reached the semifinals. Although they fell short of automatic qualification for the 2010 FIBA World Championship after losses to China and Jordan, Lebanon received a wildcard entry, securing their third consecutive World Cup appearance. Despite a victory against Canada (81–71), Lebanon couldn't progress beyond the group stage in the 2010 FIBA World Championship. Lebanon encountered a difficult period in July 2013 when the International Basketball Federation FIBA imposed an indefinite suspension. This suspension resulted from unresolved internal conflicts within the Lebanese Basketball Federation. Consequently, FIBA Asia suspended Lebanon from participating in all sanctioned events, effectively barring the country from international competitions until further notice. The suspension had significant consequences, particularly impacting Lebanon's participation in the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship. This tournament served as a qualifying event for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. Despite securing a spot in the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship based on their second-place finish in the 2013 West Asian Basketball Championship, the national federation's suspension led to their exclusion from the tournament. Following discussions and appeals, FIBA lifted the ban in May 2014, allowing Lebanon's national team to return to international basketball competitions. Lebanon displayed a significant resurgence in international basketball, culminating in a noteworthy performance at the 2022 FIBA Asia Cup, marking their return to the finals in over a decade. Despite a close contest, Lebanon finished in second place after a narrow 73–75 defeat to Australia. This marked Lebanon's fourth silver medal at the FIBA Asia Cup, adding to their previous runner-up finishes in 2001, 2005, and 2007. The tournament also highlighted the performance of Lebanon's point guard, Wael Arakji, who earned the tournament MVP title, best guard, and a spot on the All-Star Five. Building on this success, Lebanon continued their journey by securing qualification for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. Despite facing a challenging first round with three losses, Lebanon demonstrated determination, closing their World Cup campaign with consecutive victories. They secured wins against Ivory Coast (94–84) and Iran (81–73), during the classification round, concluding their World Cup appearance on a high note. Lebanon finished 23rd in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, qualifying them for the 2024 FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments. These tournaments will involve twenty-four teams competing for the final four spots at the 2024 Summer Olympics basketball tournament. The FIBA Asia Challenge, a basketball tournament held every two years for Asian national teams, was previously known as the FIBA Asia Stanković Cup (2004-2010) and FIBA Asia Cup (2012-2014). Lebanon participated in the tournament twice (2010 and 2012) and emerged victorious in 2010. This championship win granted them automatic qualification for the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship.
