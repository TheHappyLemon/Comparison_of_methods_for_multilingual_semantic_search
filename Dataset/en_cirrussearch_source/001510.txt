They were later joined by a fifth member, Daana Ots. The group won the pre-selection competition, Eurolaul, with their song "Let's Get Loud", which received 10,583 votes and went on to represent Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. Estonia performed in twelfth position in the semi-final of the 2005 Contest which was held in Kyiv, Ukraine on 19 May 2005, but failed to qualify for the grand final after finishing in 20th place.
