Levadiakos Football Club (officially romanized: Levadeiakos Greek: ΠΑΕ Λεβαδειακός) is a Greek professional football club that plays in the Super League Greece. Based in Livadeia, Greece, the club was promoted to the Alpha Ethniki, forerunner of the Super League, after ten seasons in minor divisions in the 2005–06 season, as runner-up of the Football League in 2004–05. It was then relegated to the Beta Ethniki again in 2006–07 and returned to the top tier in 2007–08. The club finished one level above relegation that year but was relegated back to the second division by finishing 14th in 2009–10. The club most recently won promotion back into the Super League Greece after winning the Super League Greece 2 in 2021–22. Levadiakos started in 1961, when local clubs Trofonios and Pallevadiaki merged into a greater club. Straight after, Levadiakos played in the second division being close to relegation in almost every season. In the 1980s, the team was upgraded and in May 1987, players and supporters of the club celebrated the team's first ever promotion to Alpha Ethniki following a career great season by Konstantinos "Prince" Litinas. Levadiakos stayed there only for four seasons, returning again only in 1994 and 1995. After their second relegation, Levadiakos declined and went very lower, even struggling to clinch promotion to the 3rd division of Greece. But once more, everything changed suddenly and the team reached again the Greek Super League after ten years, in 2005, but was immediately relegated. In the next summer, Levadiakos bought many expensive players and appointed Georgi Vasilev as manager. Vasiliev achieved to get the team to the Super League once again, and in the 2007–08 season he struggled, but managed to avoid going down again. Nevertheless, he resigned from the club and he was succeeded by Momčilo Vukotić. The club's crest has blue and green vertical stripes inspired by the great Konstantinos "Prince" Litinas. It comes from the colours of Pallevadiaki (green) and Trofonio (blue), the clubs that joined in order to establish Levadiakos. The colour common to both teams was white, which was also the basic colour of the group in the early years of its foundation. Levadiakos' stadium was built in 1952. The stadium is located in Livadeia, about 130 km north-west of Athens. The stadium itself is located on the south side of Livadeia. Best position in bold.
