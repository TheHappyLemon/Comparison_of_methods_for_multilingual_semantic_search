Yeti Airlines Pvt. Ltd. (Nepali: यती एअरलाइन्स) is an airline based in Kathmandu, Nepal. The airline was established in May 1998 and received its air operator's certificate on 17 August 1998. Since 2019, Yeti Airlines is the first carbon neutral airline in Nepal and South Asia. It is the parent company of Tara Air. As of 2022, Yeti Airlines was the second-largest domestic carrier in Nepal, after Buddha Air. Yeti Airlines was established by Ang Tshering Sherpa in May 1998 and received its Air Operators Certificate on 17 August 1998. It started operations with two de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. In 2009, Yeti Airlines established the subsidiary Tara Air to which it outsourced its STOL operations to airports in the rural and mountainous airports in Nepal and transferred its respective aircraft, DHC-6 Twin Otters and Dornier 228s to Tara Air. In late 2023, it was reported that Asian Life Insurance would take over a 49% stake of Yeti Airlines and that the company would issue an IPO. In 2007, Yeti Airlines launched Fly Yeti as a joint venture with Air Arabia. Due to political uncertainty, the airline ceased its operations in 2008. In 2013, the European Commission banned all Nepalese airlines from entering the European airspace. This restriction is still in place as of June 2021 and specifically also names Yeti Airlines. In 2014, Yeti Airlines launched Himalaya Airlines, another international joint venture, this time with Chinese Tibet Airlines. The parent company of Yeti Airlines, Yeti World, also encompasses other touristic ventures, including hotels and resorts and further airline companies, namely Air Dynasty and Altitude Air. In December 2019, Yeti World made headlines, as it was involved in a corruption case around Prime Minister K.P. Oli. Yeti Airlines offers scheduled flights to the following destinations (as of July 2023): Yeti Airlines also operates the one-hour-long Everest Express scheduled mountain sightseeing flights from Kathmandu to Mount Everest and Annapurna Express mountain sightseeing flights from Pokhara to Annapurna Massif.
