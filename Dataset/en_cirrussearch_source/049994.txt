Peg + Cat is an animated children's television series based on the children's picture book "The Chicken Problem", which was published in 2012. The series, which featured the voice acting of Hayley Faith Negrin and Dwayne Hill, was created by Billy Aronson and Jennifer Oxley and produced by Fred Rogers Productions and 9 Story Media Group. It debuted on most PBS stations on October 7, 2013, as part of the revamped PBS Kids brand, and aired 63 episodes through April 23, 2018. In Canada the show is broadcast on Treehouse TV. The show is targeted to children 3 to 5 years old. The goal is to "inspire preschoolers’ natural curiosity about math and help them develop new skills and strategies for solving problems creatively in their daily lives". In keeping with the math theme, the animation is presented as if it were drawn on graph paper. On March 3, 2015, PBS Kids renewed Peg + Cat for a second season, which started on April 4, 2016. On March 28, 2016, a one-hour two-part film aired on PBS Kids. A new film, titled Peg + Cat Save the World, focused on the duo being called upon by the President of the United States (voiced by Sandra Oh), to prevent a global disaster. On March 14, 2016, PBS Kids released the first part of the film on its YouTube channel. Peg – The main character, together with her talking cat, Cat.
