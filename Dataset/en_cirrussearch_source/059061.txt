The 1984–85 season of the European Cup club football tournament was overshadowed by the Heysel Stadium disaster that happened prior to the final match. That edition was won for the first time by Juventus in a 1–0 win against defending champions Liverpool. At sporting level, with this result they became the first club to have won all three major European trophies (European Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, and the Cup Winners' Cup), as well a posteriori as the one that needed the shortest amount of time to complete this (8 years). Following the disaster, English clubs received a five-year ban from entering any European competition, thus ending a period of great success for English clubs in the European Cup which had seen three clubs winning seven finals since 1977, including six successive finals up to 1982. Liverpool, English champions in 1989–90, were given an extra year's ban. There would be no English club to win the trophy until 1999, when Manchester United beat Bayern Munich 2–1. 19 September 1984 14:00 Hüseyin Avni Aker Stadyumu, Trabzon Attendance: 9,800 Referee: Dušan Krchňák (Czechoslovakia) 19 September 1984 16:00 Stadionul Dinamo, Bucharest Attendance: 17,000 Referee: Stojan Ilievski (Yugoslavia) 19 September 1984 16:00 Stadion Miejski w Poznaniu, Poznań Attendance: 29,000 Referee: Kjell Johansson (Sweden) 19 September 1984 16:15 Stadiumi Ruzhdi Bizhuta, Elbasan Attendance: 15,000 Referee: Lajos Németh (Hungary) 19 September 1984 17:30 Bislett stadion, Oslo Attendance: 2,489 Referee: Þorvarður Björnsson (Iceland) 19 September 1984 17:30 Marakana, Belgrade Attendance: 63,542 Referee: André Daina (Switzerland) 19 September 1984 18:00 Ratina Stadium, Tampere Attendance: 24,073 Referee: Hans Harrysson (Sweden) 19 September 1984 18:00 Stadion Georgi Asparuhov, Sofia Attendance: 23,000 Referee: Keith Hackett (England) 19 September 1984 19:00 Laugardalsvöllur, Reykjavík Attendance: 2,889 Referee: Jack Poucher (Northern Ireland) 19 September 1984 19:30 Franz-Horr-Stadion, Vienna Attendance: 6,200 Referee: Jean Koster (Luxembourg) 19 September 1984 19:30 Stade de Beggen, Luxembourg City Attendance: 702 Referee: Henning Lund-Sørensen (Denmark) 19 September 1984 20:00 Hardturm, Zürich Attendance: 4,467 Referee: José Pes Pérez (Spain) 19 September 1984 20:00 De Kuip, Rotterdam Attendance: 38,542 Referee: Neil Midgley (England) 19 September 1984 20:30 Stade du Parc Lescure, Bordeaux Attendance: 23,989 Referee: Paolo Casarin (Italy) 19 September 1984 20:30 Pittodrie Stadium, Aberdeen Attendance: 19,769 Referee: Marcel Van Langenhove (Belgium) 19 September 1984 21:00 Windsor Park, Belfast Attendance: 4,907 Referee: David Syme (Scotland) 3 October 1984 14:00 Szent Imre herceg útjai Stadion, Budapest Attendance: 6,483 Referee: Franz Wöhrer (Austria) Grasshopper won 4–3 on aggregate. 3 October 1984 15:00 Ta' Qali National Stadium, Ta' Qali Attendance: 1,509 Referee: Franz Gächter (Switzerland) Austria Wien won 8–0 on aggregate. 3 October 1984 15:30 Glenmalure Park, Dublin Attendance: 2,200 Referee: Howard King (Wales) 1–1 on aggregate;
