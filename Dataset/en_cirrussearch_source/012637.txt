On January 3, 2014, Anderson suffered a neck injury colliding with Gerald Wallace in the Pelicans' 95–92 win over the Boston Celtics. Anderson, who had to be removed from the court on a stretcher, required neck surgery and was ruled out for the rest of the season in late March. He managed just 22 games in 2013–14, averaging 19.8 points and 6.5 rebounds per game.
