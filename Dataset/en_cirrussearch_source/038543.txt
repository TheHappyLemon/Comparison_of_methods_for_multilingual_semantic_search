In May 2021, UEFA announced that Gazprom would be a partner to EURO 2020 and EURO 2024. According to the partnership terms, the company would present the UEFA EURO 2020 best goal prize for the first time ever made in the NFT format. The physical prototype of the prize was created by the Russian caligraffiti artist Pokras Lampas at the Gazprom booth in the fan zone at Konyushennaya Square, St. Petersburg, as an installation artwork featuring 432 footballs ornamented with calligraphic patterns. The digital trophy contained the encrypted names of the 2020 UEFA EURO Championship, Football for Friendship International Children's Social Program and the Nine Core Values it promoted – friendship, equality, fairness, health, peace, devotion, victory, traditions, and honor. On 27 June, the installation ceased to exist as a physical object and was reborn as a digital artwork in the NFT format. All the footballs were distributed across 11 cities that hosted the UEFA EURO 2020. At the official award ceremony on 15 October, the digital trophy was presented to Patrik Schick, the best goal scorer of the 2020 UEFA EURO Championship, and its hologram was handed over as an exhibit to the head offices of the UEFA (Nyon, Switzerland) and Gazprom (St. Petersburg, Russia). In 2019, the forum transformed into a platform for knowledge exchange between sports and education experts. In 2020, the forum established the Football for Friendship International Award. The Football for Friendship International Award is meant to identify and globally promote the best ideas for sports coaching, training of young football players, and cooperation in children's football. The goal of the award is to draw public attention to promotion of children's football in the conditions of global digitalization, and form a community of like-minded people developing these areas. The International Football for Friendship Coaches Academy is an online and free educational platform available in multiple languages. It features a series of practical upskilling sessions for coaches of children's football teams and physical education teachers. The academy's course is based on knowledge, advice and recommendations on how to organize a training process, promote active and healthy lifestyle, and foster respect for different cultures and ethnicities among young players. The course was developed by the educational process managers and coaches of FC Barcelona Academy and FIFA humanitarian program experts. The International Friendship Camp is an educational program whereby the F4F participants undergo training and team building sessions under the guidance of professional coaches. It helps children to get on well with each other both on a football pitch and in everyday life, choose the right tactics, and develop a team spirit. As part of the camp, the young participants are trained at the Nine Values School where they learn about the program's values and how to use them during a game and in ordinary life. Ecological Initiative is an annual event held since 2016 as part of the Football for Friendship program. Its young participants created the Friendship Garden in the Parco di Trenno, Milan, where each of the 32 international teams planted a tree. The 33rd tree was planted by disabled kids fostered by the Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation. In 2018, the young ambassadors of the program drew public attention to animal species threatened with extinction. Every year since then, the international football teams are named after extinct and rare species. That year, eco-friendly buses running on natural gas were used for transportation of the young participants during the final events in Moscow. In 2020, the young participants of the program held the F4F Speaks for Nature dedicated to environmental protection as part of the World Environment Day established by the UN. In 2021, the young participants shared their views on how everyone could help the planet and launched the online challenge Small Steps to Save the Planet. This digital platform specially developed for the Football for Friendship program brought together players of all ages from over 211 countries and regions and gave rise to an international tournament. Additionally it has become a gaming platform where everyone can train, form international teams and play their favorite game in the F4F format without leaving home.
