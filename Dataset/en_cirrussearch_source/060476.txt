Maxime Comtois (born January 8, 1999) is a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger for the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously played with the Anaheim Ducks. Comtois was drafted by the Victoriaville Tigres third overall in the 2015 QMJHL Entry Draft. On June 24, 2017, Comtois was selected in the second round, 50th overall by the Anaheim Ducks in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. He signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Ducks on March 3, 2018. Comtois made the Ducks' 2018 opening night roster out of training camp. On October 3, 2018, he made his professional debut in the Ducks' 2018–19 season opener in San Jose and scored his first professional goal in the first minute of the game, on his first shot attempt at goaltender Martin Jones. The Ducks went on to win the game 5–2. Comtois contributed to be amongst the Ducks scoring leaders to start the season, scoring 7 points in his first 10 games before suffering an injury. On his return he was assigned to AHL affiliate, the San Diego Gulls, before he was returned to his junior club, the Drummondville Voltigeurs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) on November 24, 2018. Following his fifth season within the Ducks organization, as a pending restricted free agent Comtois was not tendered a qualifying offer by the Ducks and was released as a free agent on July 1, 2023. Several months later, on September 12, Comtois signed a professional tryout agreement with the Vegas Golden Knights; he was subsequently released on October 9, after the conclusion of the preseason. On October 16, 2023, without a NHL contract to begin the 2023–24 season, Comtois opted to continue his career in the AHL by signing a one-year contract with independent club, the Chicago Wolves. Contributing offensively with the Wolves, Comtois was signed to a one-year, two-way contract with the Carolina Hurricanes for the remainder of the season on March 4, 2024. On December 25, 2018, Comtois was named captain for Canada national junior team while they competed at the 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He is the only player to return from the 2018 gold medal-winning team. On December 26, Comtois scored four goals in a 14–0 win over Denmark national junior team in the first game of the tournament. Comtois became the fifth player from Team Canada to score four goals in a World Juniors game, with the last being Taylor Raddysh in 2017. After Canada was eliminated from the tournament, Comtois revealed he had been playing with a separated shoulder. "Le plus beau jour de ma vie!". tigresvictoriaville.com (in French). June 10, 2015.
