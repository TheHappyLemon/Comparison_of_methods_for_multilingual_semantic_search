In September 2017, Thorne revealed that she had lived in a suburban area, spoke Spanish as her first language, and that she was bullied while growing up because she was dyslexic. She was diagnosed with dyslexia while in first grade. She was home-schooled after previously attending a public school, where she had been bullied.

In April 2010, she said she had overcome dyslexia by rigorously reading everything she could find, including cereal box labels. In January 2018, Thorne wrote on Instagram that she had been physically and sexually abused as a child, "from the day I can remember till I was 14". In 2019, she told ABC News' Juju Chang that the abuse began when she was six years old. She did not name her alleged abuser, but said that he was "someone I was raised with". Thorne's first film appearance was an uncredited role as a sidelines fan in the 2003 film Stuck on You. She has since appeared in film and television projects including Entourage and The O.C. as a younger version of Taylor Townsend. In 2007, she joined the recurring cast of Dirty Sexy Money's second season as Margaux Darling. This is her first major television role. The series revolves around lawyer and family man Nick George when Nick's father mysteriously dies in a plane crash, he agrees to take his position as the Darling family's lawyer, while trying to discover who committed the murder. In 2008, Thorne starred alongside Christian Slater and Taylor Lautner in the short-lived drama series My Own Worst Enemy, for which she won a Young Artist Award for her portrayal of the character Ruthy Spivey; Thorne described her Enemy casting as a major breakthrough as this was the first recurring role in her career.

Her older brother Remy also guest-starred in the same episode as a younger Eddie Latekka.[citation needed] In 2009, she starred in the web series Little Monk, which depicted characters from the series Monk, as Wendy, one of Adrian Monk's classmates.

On July 25, 2013, the Disney Channel confirmed that Shake It Up would be canceled after the end of the third season. On April 23, 2013, Thorne announced her debut album with eleven songs. Thorne spoke about the album, saying "What fans can expect is [for it] just to be very different from anyone because I don't like to be one of those artists where you can be like: 'Oh yeah, I know them from that song.' All my songs are very different from each other. So I don't want to be known as only one genre." Thorne cited Britney Spears, Kesha, and Destiny's Child as influences for the album. In 2013, it was reported that Thorne had signed a new deal to write a series of books, beginning with her first novel, Autumn Falls.

Thorne has signed on as one of the leads in Manis Film's thriller Big Sky; Thorne plays Hazel. In 2014, Thorne was cast in the MTV series Scream, which is a television adaptation based on the original slasher film series Scream. Thorne was offered the lead role of the series but felt that the role of the "mean, terrible Nina" would be more iconic. In 2015, Thorne was cast in the animated U.S. dub of the film The Frog Kingdom, portraying the role of Frog Princess. The film was scheduled to be released on video on demand and on DVD beginning on June 30, 2015, by Lionsgate Home Entertainment. On June 1, 2015, it was announced that Thorne would star in the AwesomenessTV film Shovel Buddies, playing the role of Kate. The movie was released on iTunes on October 11, 2016.

She also starred alongside Jake Manley in the heist-thriller Infamous which was released on June 12, 2020. She received praise for her performance, with critic Nick Allen states that she had "the classically great presence of someone like Sandra Bullock, but with her own scraggly edge ... Thorne dominates numerous scenes that catapult her character from clout-hungry wannabe to gun-selfie superstar." In August 2020, Thorne joined OnlyFans and became the first person to earn $1 million in the first 24 hours of joining the platform. She earned $2 million in less than a week. Her activities on OnlyFans sparked controversy after she offered $200 pay-per-view photos she claimed were "naked", but the photos were actually of her wearing lingerie, leading to a slew of chargebacks and new restrictions that limited the amount that sex workers on the platform could charge and reduced payouts to creators to monthly rather than weekly. However, OnlyFans denied the changes were related to Thorne. Thorne claimed she created an account as research for a role in an upcoming film with Sean Baker, which Baker denied. She also claimed that money made through the page would be used to fund her production company and distributed to worthy charitable causes. In 2021, she was the second highest earning content creator on the platform, earning 11 million dollars a month. In November 2020, Thorne starred in the thriller Girl, directed by Chad Faust. The movie itself received mixed reviews but critics entitled this to be Thorne's best performance to date. In the same month she also starred in the action comedy film Chich Fight alongside Malin Akerman and directed by Paul Leyden, In 2021, Thorne played Lily in season 1 of Amazon Prime Video's Paradise City. She also starred in other projects, such as Masquerade and Time Is Up. In the same year, Thorne starred and served as an executive producer on the film Habit, which is directed by Janell Shirtcliff, Leave Not One Alive opposite Melissa Leo, directed by Jordan Galland, and The Trainer directed by Tony Kaye. In addition to her acting and singing careers, Thorne is also a published writer. In 2014, she wrote Autumn Falls, the first in a series of three young adult novels - the other two being Autumn's Kiss (2015) and Autumn's Wish (2016) - about a teenage girl who navigates through the pitfalls of adolescence with help from her diary, which may have links to the supernatural. In July 2019, Rare Bird Books published The Life of a Wannabe Mogul: Mental Disarray Vol. 1, a book of Thorne's autobiographical poetry. Thorne is recognized for holding a controversial public image. While working on Disney, she stated that she felt restricted, and that "I wish I would have been true to myself," and that "After Disney, I had the opportunity to find my true self and that is reflected in all my work from acting, producing, directing, and writing. I have more artistic freedom to continue to express myself." Thorne has appeared in over 30 commercials, including Neutrogena and Texas Instruments. Her advertising campaigns include Guess Jeans, Tommy Hilfiger, J.Lo Girls, Candie's, Ralph Lauren, Gap and Diesel.

From April 2019 to June 2022, she was in a relationship with Italian singer Benjamin Mascolo and they announced their engagement in March 2021. However, in June 2022, the couple officially announced their split. In May 2023, Thorne announced her engagement to entrepreneur and Bad Vegan producer Mark Emms.

Later that year, she addressed the issue of pornographic deepfakes. In a 2021 interview with Bloody Disgusting, Thorne stated that she has been a life-long fan of the horror genre.
