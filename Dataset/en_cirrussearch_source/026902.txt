In 2015, the maiden spaceflights of the Chinese Long March 6 and Long March 11 launch vehicles took place. A total of 87 orbital launches were attempted in 2015, of which 82 were successful, one was partially successful and four were failures. The year also saw seven EVAs by ISS astronauts. The majority of the year's orbital launches were conducted by Russia, the United States and China, with 27, 20 and 19 launches respectively. In February 2015, the European Space Agency's experimental lifting body spacecraft, the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle, successfully conducted its first test flight. In March 2015, Ceres became the first dwarf planet to be visited by a spacecraft when Dawn entered orbit. In July 2015, New Horizons visited the Pluto-Charon system after a 9-year voyage, returning a trove of pictures and information about the former "ninth planet" (now classified as a dwarf planet). Meanwhile, the MESSENGER probe was deliberately crashed into Mercury after 4 years of in-orbit observations. On 23 November 2015, the Blue Origin New Shepard suborbital rocket achieved its first powered soft landing near the launch site, paving the way for full reuse of its propulsion stage. On 21 December, the maiden flight of the SpaceX Falcon 9 Full Thrust took place, ending with a successful landing of its first stage. Two old weather satellites, NOAA-16 and DMSP 5D-2/F13, broke up in 2015, creating several hundred pieces of space debris. In both cases, a battery explosion is suspected as the root cause. For the purposes of this section, the yearly tally of orbital launches by country assigns each flight to the country of origin of the rocket, not to the launch services provider or the spaceport. For example, Soyuz launches by Arianespace in Kourou are counted under Russia because Soyuz-2 is a Russian rocket. 5 10 15 20 Ariane Atlas Delta Falcon H-II Long March PSLV R-7 UR Vega Others   Ariane 5   Atlas V   Delta II   Delta IV   Delta IV Heavy   Falcon 9   H-IIA   H-IIB   Long March 2   Long March 3   Long March 4   Long March 6   Long March 11   PSLV   Soyuz-U   Soyuz-FG   Soyuz-2 (Russia)   Soyuz-ST (Europe)   Proton-M   Rokot   Vega   Others 5 10 15 20 China France India Iran Japan Kazakhstan Russia United States   Jiuquan   Taiyuan   Xichang   Kourou   Satish Dhawan   Semnan   Tanegashima   Uchinoura   Baikonur   Dombarovsky   Plesetsk   Barking Sands   Cape Canaveral   Kennedy   MARS   Vandenberg 10 20 30 40 50 Transatmospheric Low Earth Geosynchronous / transfer Medium Earth High Earth Heliocentric orbit   Transatmospheric   Low Earth   Low Earth (ISS)   Low Earth (SSO)   Low Earth (retrograde)   Geosychronous (transfer)   Medium Earth   High Earth   Heliocentric Soyuz TMA-16M launches carrying ISS year long mission crew members Scott Kelly and Mikhail Korniyenko and Soyuz commander Gennady Padalka.

The vehicle landed at Cape Canaveral LZ-1. A close-up view of one of many high albedo regions on the dwarf planet Ceres spotted by the Dawn spacecraft upon its arrival in March. Ceres was the second world to be visited by Dawn after the main belt asteroid 4 Vesta. Commander Scott Kelly is pulled from the Soyuz TMA-M Eridan following its landing in Kazakhstan in March. The landing signalled the conclusion of Kelly's and Mikhail Kornienko's year in space. A true colour view of Pluto, photographed by the New Horizons spacecraft during its historic flyby in July. Launched in 2006, the spacecraft traversed a distance of nearly 5 billion kilometres (3.1 billion miles) before performing the first ever reconnaissance of a Kuiper belt object (KBO). The European experimental spaceplane IXV was briefly in orbit but did not receive a COSPAR catalog number. @elonmusk (10 January 2015). "Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard.
