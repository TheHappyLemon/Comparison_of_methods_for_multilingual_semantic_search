Milly, V. Hložník. In 1956 Lehen won first place in the Czechoslovak national competition for realist productions and a year later won second place in a graphics art competition,[clarification needed]. Near the conclusion of the 1950s his works toured Belgium, China and the Soviet Union. Ultimately, he was charged in a show trial typical of communist Czechoslovakia, and from 1962 he spent 6 years behind bars at Leopoldov Prison. During the reforms of the Prague Spring of 1968 he was found innocent and released, and after his release Lehen started painting and become very solitary. Some of his works are now on permanent display at the Slovak National Gallery in Bratislava. He composed chess problems since 1977. He has gained distinctions including the first prizes in many chess composition tourneys, often in coauthorship with IM Juraj Brabec.
