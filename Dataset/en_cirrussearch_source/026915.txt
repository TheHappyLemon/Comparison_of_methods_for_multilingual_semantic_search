65 (sixty-five) is the natural number following 64 and preceding 66. 65 is the nineteenth distinct semiprime, (5.13); and the third of the form (5.q), where q is a higher prime. 65 has a prime aliquot sum of 19 within an aliquot sequence of one composite numbers (65,19,1,0) to the prime; as the first member' of the 19-aliquot tree. It is an octagonal number. It is also a Cullen number. Given 65, the Mertens function returns 0. This number is the magic constant of a 5x5 normal magic square: [17241815235714164613202210121921311182529].{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}17&24&1&8&15\\23&5&7&14&16\\4&6&13&20&22\\10&12&19&21&3\\11&18&25&2&9\end{bmatrix}}.} This number is also the magic constant of n-Queens Problem for n = 5. 65 is the smallest integer that can be expressed as a sum of two distinct positive squares in two (or more) ways, 65 = 82 + 12 = 72 + 42.
