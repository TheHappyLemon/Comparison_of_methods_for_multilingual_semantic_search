The 2019 Critérium du Dauphiné was the 71st edition of the Critérium du Dauphiné, a road cycling stage race. The race took place between 9 and 16 June 2019, in France and Switzerland.[citation needed] On 25 March 2019, the race organisers, the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the route at a presentation in Lyon. The eighteen UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited to participate. In addition, four UCI Professional Continental teams received wildcard invitations: Cofidis, Arkéa–Samsic, Vital Concept–B&B Hotels and Wanty–Gobert. In total, twenty-two teams started the race, with seven riders per team: UCI WorldTeams AG2R La Mondiale Astana Bahrain–Merida Bora–Hansgrohe CCC Team Deceuninck–Quick-Step EF Education First Groupama–FDJ Team Katusha–Alpecin Lotto–Soudal Mitchelton–Scott Movistar Team Team Dimension Data Team Jumbo–Visma Team Sunweb Trek–Segafredo UAE Team Emirates Team Ineos UCI Professional Continental teams Cofidis Arkéa–Samsic Vital Concept–B&B Hotels Wanty–Gobert Chris Froome (Team Ineos) was the favourite for the race, having won three previous editions.

In the Critérium du Dauphiné, four different jerseys were awarded. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on all stages except for the individual time trial: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. The rider with the least accumulated time is the race leader, identified by a yellow jersey with a blue bar; the winner of this classification was considered the winner of the race. Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 10 in a stage. More points were awarded on the flatter stages in the opening half of the race. There was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a blue jersey with white polka dots. In the mountains classification, points towards the classification were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either hors, first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. Hors-category climbs awarded the most points; the first ten riders were able to accrue points, compared with the first six on first-category climbs, the first four on second-category, the first two on third-category and only the first for fourth-category. The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born on or after 1 January 1993 were eligible to be ranked in the classification. There was also a team classification, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time.
