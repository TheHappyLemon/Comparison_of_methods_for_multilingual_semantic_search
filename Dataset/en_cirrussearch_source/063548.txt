Noussair Mazraoui (Arabic: نُصَيْر مَزرَاوِيّ; born 14 November 1997) is a professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich and the Morocco national team. He can also play as a left-back, midfielder or winger. Mazraoui grew up in Alphen aan de Rijn and started playing for local club AVV Alphen at age 4. He moved to Alphense Boys three years later, where he only played for a year before being invited to play in the youth academy of Ajax. He made his professional debut with Jong Ajax on 12 August 2016 in an Eerste Divisie game against Almere City, replacing Richairo Živković after 86 minutes. On 4 February 2018, he made his Eredivisie debut, coming off the bench to substitute David Neres, in a 3–1 victory over NAC Breda. In the following season, on 2 October 2018, he scored his first Champions League goal in a 1–1 away draw against Bayern Munich, followed by the only goal in the 92nd minute of stoppage time in a 1–0 victory over Benfica on 23 October. On 16 December 2018, he netted his first Eredivisie goal in an 8–0 thrashing of De Graafschap. During his breakthrough season, he was named Ajax Talent of the Year, in which he won the domestic double with the club, played in the Champions Legaue semi-finals, and scored four goals in a total of 48 matches. On 25 October 2020, Mazraoui scored his third Champions League goal in a 3–1 victory against FC Midtjylland, in which Ajax eventually managed to win another domestic double in the 2020–21 season. In the 2021–22 Champions League, he was part of the team which won all their six matches in the group stage. In his last season at Ajax, he managed to score five goals, all in the league, and provide four assists in 35 matches in all competitions. On 24 May 2022, Mazraoui signed a four-year deal with Bayern Munich, starting from 1 July. In January 2023, he had an inflammation in his pericardium after suffering from Covid-19, which would rule him out for six to eight weeks. On 13 May 2023, Mazraoui scored his first goal for the club in a 6–0 home win against FC Schalke 04 at the Allianz Arena. Mazraoui was a youth international for Morocco. He first played for the Moroccan national team in 2018. On 10 November 2021, Mazraoui revealed that the relations between him and Moroccan national team coach Vahid Halilhodžić fell. On 13 March 2022, Mazraoui and his Moroccan teammate, Hakim Ziyech, both rejected Halilhodžić's invitation to represent Morocco in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – CAF third round against DR Congo. He later accepted to join the national team and represented Morocco in the 2022 FIFA World Cup after Halilhodžić was replaced by Walid Regragui. On 10 November 2022, he was named in Morocco's 26-man squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. He played a role in Morocco's charge to the semi-finals, helping them become the first African side to reach the final 4 stage at the World Cup. On 28 December 2023, Mazraoui was amongst the 27 players selected by coach Walid Regragui to represent Morocco in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations. In May 2023, Mazraoui supported his compatriot Zakaria Aboukhlal, who had refused to wear a T-shirt in support of the LGBT community, with an Instagram comment.[citation needed] At the following home game between FC Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig, fans then showed several banners asking Mazraoui to respect FC Bayern's values. In October 2023, during the Israel-Hamas war, Mazraoui shared a Pro-Palestinian video via Instagram wishing "victory to our oppressed brothers in Palestine", which was met with criticism from German Bundestag member Johannes Steiniger who demanded his extradition from the country. Due to that on top of a colossal backlash within the Bundesliga and Germany MPs, Mazraoui then emphasized that he was against all types of terrorism, hatred and violence. A few days after Mazraoui's public apology, as well as a personal conversation of him with the club management; FC Bayern Munich announced that there would be no consequences. Following a Champions League match against Galatasaray in Istanbul, the club officials held talks with both Mazraoui and his FC Bayern Munchen Israeli teammate Daniel Peretz; in addition, the former expressed willingness to meet members of Makkabi Deutschland. A week later, Mazraoui met with representatives of the Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria including their President Charlotte Knobloch.
