Krāslava District (Latvian: Krāslavas rajons) was an administrative division of Latvia, located in Latgale region, in the country's east. It was organized into two cities and twenty three parishes, each with a local government authority. The main city in the district was Krāslava. The district was eliminated during the administrative-territorial reform in 2009, most of its part being divided between Dagda and Krāslava municipalities and three parishes in north-west joining Aglona Municipality.
