The 2024 Winter Youth Olympics (Korean: 2024년 동계 청소년 올림픽, romanized: 2024nyeon Donggye Cheongsonyeon Ollimpik), officially known as the IV Winter Youth Olympic Games and commonly known as Gangwon 2024 (Korean: 강원 2024), were a winter multi-sport event, cultural festival, and fourth edition of the Winter Youth Olympics held between 19 January and 1 February 2024 in Gangwon Province, South Korea. That was the third time South Korea hosted the Olympic Games, after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, and the second time the country hosted the Winter games, after the 2018 Olympics. It was also the first Winter Youth Olympics held in Asia, as well as the third overall Youth Olympic Games in the continent, after the 2010 Olympics in Singapore and the 2014 Olympics in Nanjing, China (all Summer Games). The IOC's Future Host Commission named Gangwon as its preferred candidate for the Games and entered into targeted dialogue with the region under the new Olympic bid process. Brașov, Romania; Granada, Spain; and Sofia, Bulgaria were the other interested parties. They took part in the continuous dialogue with the IOC and the Future Host Commission. Gangwon was officially awarded the Games at the 135th IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 10 January 2020; all of the requirements were fulfilled to the satisfaction of the commission and the executive board. The events will be shared between Gangneung city and Pyeongchang County, which previously hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics. They were the first Winter Youth Olympics held outside of Europe. Much of the venues of the 2018 Winter Olympics were used again ; the snow events were held in the county of Pyeongchang, while the ice events were held in Gangneung. If the circumstances were allowed (but they weren't), the city of Wonsan, North Korea would have been involved, and could have been the host of some alpine events. The Alpensia Sports Park in Daegwallyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang, was the main focus of the games, like in 2018. Yongpyong Dome – opening ceremony Alpensia Ski Jumping Centre – ski jumping, Nordic combined Alpensia Biathlon Centre – biathlon, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined Alpensia Sliding Centre – luge, bobsleigh, skeleton  Additionally, a stand-alone venue was located in Hoengseong: Welli Hilli Park – freestyle skiing (slopestyle, halfpipe, Big Air, skicross), snowboarding Another stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in neighboring Jeongseon County: High1 Resort – alpine skiing, freestyle skiing (moguls), Youth Olympic Village The Gangneung Olympic Park, in the neighborhood of Gyo-dong in Gangneung hosted the four indoor sports venues and the closing ceremony.

This means that the same number of events in the Olympic program were the same for men and women (34). The program for this edition featured 7 sports and 15 disciplines in a total of 81 events. The International Olympic Committee had decided in 2021, that for the first time, there would be no mixed NOCs events. The sporting program also received changes as mixed-gender relays were added in cross-country skiing and Nordic combined. Two 1,500m individual events in short-track speed skating were held for the first time. However, the number of events at the cross-country skiing were dropped from 7 to 5.

The mascot is in shape of a snowball that was born from a snow fight between Soohorang and Bandabi, the mascots of the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics.
