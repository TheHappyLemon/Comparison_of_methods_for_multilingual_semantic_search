Early Olympic Games allowed for individuals in a team to be from different nations. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) now groups their results together under the mixed team designation (IOC code ZZX). During the 1900 Summer Olympics, several teams comprising international members won 19 medals in 12 different events. Six medalists of mixed teams won two medals as part of mixed teams in the 1900 Summer Olympics. Three of them were rugby players who also won medals in tug of war. Three were sailors who won both races in an event staged twice. IOC. "Paris 1900 5000m team men Results - Olympic athletics". Olympics.com. Retrieved 2021-08-09. IOC.
