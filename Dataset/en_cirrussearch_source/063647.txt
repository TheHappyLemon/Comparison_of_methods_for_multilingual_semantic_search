10,000 BC is a 2008 American action-adventure film co-written, co-produced and directed by Roland Emmerich, co-written, co-scored, and executive produced by Harald Kloser, and starring Steven Strait and Camilla Belle. The film depicts the journeys of a prehistoric tribe of mammoth hunters. The film was a box office hit, but was consistently regarded by professional critics as Emmerich's worst film, as well as one of the worst films of 2008. In 10,000 BC, a hunter-gatherer tribe called the Yagahl lived in the Ural Mountains and survived by hunting woolly mammoths, but the woolly mammoths have become more scarce due to the rapidly dwindling population. A hunter who has killed a manak single-handedly and earned the White Spear venerates Old Mother, an elderly Neanderthal with shamanistic powers. The village chief finds a young girl named Evolet, who had survived a massacre of her village perpetrated by what Old Mother calls "four-legged demons," who will come when "the Yagahl go on their last hunt." The tribe believes the demons are the mammoths and sets out to hunt the herd leader; however, the current chief does not trust the prophecy and leaves to find another way to save his people faster. He entrusts the White Spear, his young son D'Leh, and the true purpose of his quest to his friend Tic'Tic. The tribe's children ridicule D'Leh for his father's cowardice, and he seeks comfort from Evolet, and the two begin to fall in love. Years later, when the mammoths finally return, the adult D'Leh hunts them with his tribe's men under Tic'Tic's leadership and kills one by accident, inadvertently winning the White Spear and Evolet. The next day, horse-mounted riders attack the camp. The warlord, taken by Evolet’s beauty, kidnaps her, enslaves the able-bodied, and kills those who fight back, leaving very few survivors. D'Leh, Tic'Tic, Ka'Ren, and a young boy, Baku, set out to rescue their fellow Yagahl as Old Mother follows their journey in spirit. During an attack on the slavers by terror birds, Evolet is recaptured along with Ka'Ren and Baku, and Tic'Tic is wounded. While hunting, D'Leh falls into a pit, where he helps free a trapped saber-tooth tiger, asking it not to eat him before escaping. Tic'Tic recovers and finds their way to a sedentary Naku village, also attacked by the riders. The surviving villagers nearly attack them until the saber-tooth tiger comes to save D'Leh from the initially hostile Naku. They also learn that D'Leh's father was a guest of the Naku before the riders captured him. Several tribes arrive to form a coalition to defeat the slavers, with D'Leh as their leader. They find the ships holding Evolet and their loved ones but fail to reach them before they cast off. They set out to follow on foot, and D'Leh learns to use the North Star to navigate the journey. D'Leh and the tribes discover an advanced Egyptian civilization ruled by the "Almighty", an untouchable god-king, who is using the kidnapped tribesmen along with some mammoths to build pyramids. D'Leh and Tic’Tic sneak into the slave cages, and D’Leh learns that his father was killed trying to defend a slave. The party is spotted by the guards, who Tic'Tic kills before he succumbs to his wound. D'Leh and the tribesman infiltrate the civilization, and D'Leh starts a rebellion among the slaves, killing many of the Almighty's forces. However, Ka'Ren sacrifices himself as D'Leh eventually starts a stampede. The Almighty threatens to kill Evolet if they do not abandon their rebellion. D'Leh feigns acceptance but easily kills the Almighty with the White Spear, breaking his illusion of godhood. During the ensuing battle, the warlord kills Evolet, who is then killed by D'Leh. Devastated, he holds Evolet in his arms as she dies, but her life is restored in exchange for Old Mother’s, who dies having fulfilled her final duty. With the Almighty dead and his civilization destroyed, the Yagahl bid farewell to the other tribes and returned home with seeds collected by D’Leh’s father, given to them by the Naku to start a new life.

Emmerich opened casting sessions in late October 2005. In February 2006, Camilla Belle and Steven Strait were announced to star in the film, with Strait as the mammoth hunter and Belle as his love. Emmerich decided that casting well known actors would distract from the realistic feel of the prehistoric setting. "If like, Jake Gyllenhaal turned up in a movie like this, everybody would be, 'What's that?'", he explained. The casting of unknown actors also helped keep the film's budget down. At the 2008 Wondercon, Emmerich mentioned the fiction of Robert E. Howard as a primary influence for the film's setting, as well as his love for the film Quest for Fire and the book Fingerprints of the Gods. He invited composer Harald Kloser to help write the screenplay after he liked his story suggestions to The Day After Tomorrow. When the project received the greenlight from Columbia Pictures, screenwriter John Orloff began work on a new draft of the original script. Columbia Pictures, under Sony Pictures Entertainment, dropped the project due to a busy release calendar, and Warner Bros. picked up the project in Sony's absence. The script went through a second revision with Matthew Sand and a final revision with Robert Rodat. Production began in early 2006 in South Africa and Namibia. Location filming also took place in southern New Zealand and Thailand. Emmerich wanted to shoot the entire film in Africa but was barred from shooting a certain helicopter scene which led to them going to New Zealand for those shots. Before shooting began, the production had spent eighteen months on research and development for the computer-generated imagery. Two companies recreated prehistoric animals. To cut time (it was taking sixteen hours to render a single frame) 50% of the CGI models' fur was removed, as "it turned out half the fur looked the same" to the director. Filming took place for a total of 102 days, 20 days longer than planned. Emmerich rejected making the film in an ancient language (similar to The Passion of the Christ or Apocalypto), deciding that it would not be as emotionally engaging. Dialect coach Brendan Gunn was hired by Emmerich and Kloser to create "a half dozen" languages for the film. Gunn has stated that he collaborated informally with film lead Steven Strait to improvise what the languages would sound like. He also used some local African languages and their dialects, including the Oshiwambo language native to Namibia, which can be heard faintly, spoken by the wise blind man. In an alternative ending, the scene shifts forward many years into the future, showing Baku's retelling of the story by the camp fire. It ends with a child asking what had happened to the "Mountains of the Gods", and Baku responds, "They were taken back by the sands. Lost to time, lost to man". The woolly mammoths in the movie were based on elephants and fossils of mammoths, while the saber-toothed cat was based on tigers and ligers (a lion/tiger hybrid). The sounds made by the saber-toothed cat in the movie are based on the vocalization of tigers and lions. The world premiere was held on February 10, 2008, at Sony Center on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. The film was a moderate success at the box office. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $35.8 million in 3,410 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking No. 1 at the box office, and grossing over $22 million more than the film in second place, College Road Trip. As of 29 April 2008[update], it has grossed approximately $268.6 million worldwide—$94.6 million in the United States and Canada and $174 million in other territories—including $17.2 million in Mexico, $13.1 million in Spain, $11.3 million in the United Kingdom, and $10.8 million in China. This also makes it the first film of 2008 to surpass the $200 million mark. Critics noted that the film is archaeologically inaccurate and contains many factual errors and anachronisms. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 9% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 3.40/10. The website's critics' consensus states: "With attention strictly paid to style instead of substance, or historical accuracy, 10,000 BC is a visually impressive but narratively flimsy epic." Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 34 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "C" on an A+ to F scale. Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote: "Conventional where it should be bold and mild where it should be wild, 10,000 BC reps a missed opportunity to present an imaginative vision of a prehistoric moment." Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote: "Roland Emmerich's great big CGI blockbuster lumbers along like one of the woolly mammoths that roam across the screen." Composer Thomas Wander won a BMI Film Music Award for his work on the film. The film was released on June 17, 2008, in single-disc editions on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United States. Best Buy released a 2-disc limited edition along with the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases. It was released on July 1, 2008, in the United Kingdom. The film grossed $31,341,721 in DVD sales, bringing its total film gross to $300,414,491.
