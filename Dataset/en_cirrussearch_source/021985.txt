Brand-Erbisdorf (German pronunciation: [ˌbʁant ˈɛɐ̯bɪsdɔɐ̯f] ) is a small town in the district of Mittelsachsen, in Saxony, Germany. It is situated 5 km south of Freiberg. As of 2020, the town has a population of 9,145. The town is first mentioned in 1209 as Erlwinesberc, although it is suggested that it was founded earlier, in the middle of the 12th century. The long tradition of silver mining around the town came to an end in the beginning of the 20th century. It was only after 1945 that the mining industry reappeared to a limited extent, before finally closing in 1968. From 1900 onwards, various other industries began to take hold in the town, slowly replacing mining as the primary industry. Of these were most notably the wood industry originating from the Ore Mountains and the "Elite-Werke".
