Leshy (also Leshi; Russian: леший, IPA: [ˈlʲeʂɨj]; literally, "[he] from the forest", Polish: borowy, leśnik, leśniczy, lasowik, leszy) is a tutelary deity of the forests in pagan Slavic mythology. As Leshy rules over the forest and hunting, he may be related to the Slavic god Porewit. There is also a deity, named Svyatibor (Svyatobor, Svyatibog), who is revered by both the Eastern and Western Slavs, heralded as the divine arbiter of woodland realms and the sovereign ruler over other Leshies. His functions were identical to those of the god Veles. Leshy, a masculine entity of humanoid form, possesses the remarkable ability to adopt the guise of any appearance and can change in size and height. In some accounts, Leshy is described as having a wife (Leshachikha, Leszachka, Lesovikha and also, sometimes, the Kikimora of the swamp) and children (leshonki, leszonky). Leshy is reputed for his inclination to misguide wanderers and abduct young ones, a trait he shares with the notorious Chort, "Black One" known as Devil, thus leading certain individuals to perceive him as a malevolent entity. Leshy's attitude towards humans can vary, depending on how they interact with the forest and their overall behavior. Leshy possessed the power to whisk away children afflicted by the malevolent maledictions of their own kin, especially their parents, to the ethereal realm of the forest-dwelling folk. Leshy can be considered as a rather temperamental creature, similar to that of a fairy. Leshy is known by a variety of names and spellings including the following: Main name variations: Borovoi (Russian: Боровой, Polish: Borowy) "[he] of the pine barrens" Gayevoi (Russian: Гаевой, Polish: Gajowy) "[he] of the grove" Leshak (Russian: Лешак, Serbo-Croatian: Lešak, Лешак) Leshy (Russian: Леший, Belarusian: Лешы, Polish: Leszy, Serbo-Croatian: Lešij, Лешиј) [he] of the deciduous forests Lesnik (Russian: Лесник, Polish: Leśnik, Bulgarian: Лесник, Serbo-Croatian: Lesnik, Лесник) Lesovik (Russian: Лесовик, Belarusian: Лесавік, Ukrainian: Лісовик, Serbo-Croatian: Lesovik, Лесовик) Lesovoi (Russian: Лесовой, Serbo-Croatian: Lesovoj, Лесовој) Lesun (Russian: Лесун, Belarusian: Лясун) Mežainis, (Latvian: "forester") Miškinis (Lithuanian: "forest-man") Miško velnias (Lithuanian: "Forest devil") Vir'ava (Erzya: Вирьава) "forest mother" Lauma (Latvian: Lauma; Lithuanian: Laumė; Yotvingian: Łauma), a fairy-like woodland spirit, and guardian spirit of orphans in Eastern Baltic mythology, or Yotvingian mythology Euphemistic titles: He (Russian: он) also used for the devil, based on superstition prohibiting invocation of evil He himself (Russian: он сам) like "he" Les chestnoi (Russian: Лес честной) "honorable one of the forest" Les pravedniy (Russian: Лес праведный) "righteous one of the forest" Lesnoi dedushka/ded or Dedushka-lesovoi (Russian: Лесной дедушка/дед, Дедушка-лесовой, Belarusian: Лясны дзед, Polish: Leśny dziad) "forest grandfather" Lesnoi dukh (Russian: Лесной дух, Polish: Leśny duch) "forest spirit" Lesnoi dyadya (Russian: Лесной дядя) "forest uncle" Lesnoi khozyain (Russian: Лесной хозяин) "forest master" Lesnoi zhitel' (Russian: Лесной житель) "forest dweller" or "woodsman" Lesny muzhik , "forest man" Leshy's appearance in mythological tales serves as a testament to his supernatural essence and deep connection to the forest. As a representation of the forest itself, Leshy can assume various forms that are closely associated with it. This enigmatic creature possesses multiple identities, embodying elements of animals, plants, humans, whirlwinds, and even ethereal spirits. The external appearance of Leshy, much like other mythical beings, is often left undefined in the stories, perhaps to maintain its elusive nature. Additionally, the narrator might intentionally refrain from vividly describing this impure force, perceiving it as potentially dangerous. In ancient tales, Leshy possesses a captivating hybrid form, displaying an intriguing asymmetry in each manifestation. It is often embodied as a majestic flora entity - a revered tree, be it a pine, spruce, birch, oak, or aspen, or even as a humble bush, stump, leaf, or mushroom. Gradually, it assumes human-like characteristics, with its shape resembling that of a person and its branches resembling flowing locks of hair. Conversely, the influence of vegetation can be prominently observed, with its long, untamed green hair mimicking branches of trees or bushes, a beard adorned with lichen, and attire adorned with moss that imitates the color and texture of wood. Its countenance may even bear a resemblance to moss-covered face, its skin as resilient as bark. Yet, at times, these vegetal traits are reduced to mere adornments - a club or batoge held in its hand, a verdant beard, and eyes and garments tinted with the hue of foliage. The association with the forest is further enhanced by Leshy's ability to discipline humans with twigs, creating uproar, and resonating with the harmonic melodies of trees. Occasionally, Leshy personifies the entire forest, encompassing its vast expanse. In the realm of folklore, Leshy assumes a myriad of forms, some of which mirror zooanthropomorphic creatures. These manifestations encompass both untamed beasts that inspire reverence, such as the bear, wolf, owl, demonic hare, frog, crow, and magpie, as well as domesticated animals like the dog, black cat, horse, and black goat. Furthermore, Leshy frequently takes on the visage of a being that is half-human and half-goat, akin to a diabolical figure. This embodiment is characterized by a dense covering of black wool, diminutive and curved horns, hooves, luxuriant hair upon the head, and an extensive beard. Alternatively, Leshy may adopt the form of a person adorned with animal attributes, such as excessive hairiness, garments crafted from animal skins, claws adorning the hands and feet, hooves, a tail, wings, and even horse bridles. It is not uncommon for Leshy to be accompanied by a creature of its own, such as a black dog or a diminutive black goat. The prevailing depiction of Leshy, a mythical creature with human-like characteristics, is a relatively recent creation. However, even when portrayed as a man, Leshy still possesses fantastical qualities. It can appear as either a towering figure or an unassuming individual. With long, unkempt or neatly groomed hair in shades of gray, green, or occasionally red, and a similarly colored beard, Leshy's appearance can vary. Sometimes, it is imagined that Leshy's face is as pale as the bark of a birch tree. Its eyes come in various shades, from green to unnaturally pale, even white, or lead-blue, or dazzling, or lifeless. They may protrude, or the right eye may be fixed and larger than the left, or both eyes may be larger than those of a human, or perpetually unblinking. Leshy may lack eyebrows, eyelashes (though occasionally sporting bushy brows), or even have missing nostrils, a right ear, or one eye, and can even have a limp. Some accounts suggest that Leshy possesses an upward-pointed head. In certain depictions, Leshy is said to possess blue blood, leading to a complexion of the same color. Within various narratives, Leshy exhibits a distinct inclination to conceal their countenance, avoiding direct eye contact with others or presenting an enigmatic face that remains unseen. When seated, Leshy typically crosses their left leg over the right. According to certain Belarusian beliefs, Leshy possesses a peculiar visage characterized by a flattened, jutting rib-like structure, an elongated triangular beard, a solitary eye, and a solitary leg with the heel positioned forward. The portrayal of Leshy as a weathered old man with a gray beard is widely prevalent. Frequently, Leshy manifests in the guise of a familiar figure, be it a relative, neighbor, or acquaintance, and the deceit is often only unveiled upon returning home, when it becomes apparent that the encountered individual was actually in an entirely different location. Furthermore, Leshy has the ability to assume the appearance of a deceased person. When it comes to describing the height of Leshy, there is a wide range of opinions. Some imagine him to be a colossal giant, easily crossing rivers due to his immense stature. Conversely, others see him as a small person, not exceeding the average height of a typical individual. In some beliefs, it is said that the height of Leshy changes based on the surrounding vegetation, being as tall as the trees in the forest and as small as the grass in a clearing. Other perspectives suggest that Leshy appears giant from afar but appears ordinary or small when seen up close, with the ability to change its size at will. In the northern regions of Russia, Leshy was categorized into different species based on their size, including those that acted as guardians of the forest, those that resembled mushrooms, and those that were akin to mosses. Leshy was believed to possess incredible strength, with his weight being so heavy that even a horse would have trouble pulling the cart he sat on. His hand was also rumored to be equally heavy. This supernatural being defied the laws of nature with his immense power and weight, leaving a lasting impact on anyone who encountered him. It is widely believed that Leshy is dressed like an ordinary person. He may wear leather or fur clothing, an armyak, a woolen homemade caftan, a siberka, clothing similar to a balaklava or a cassock with wide sleeves. The headwear is diverse: a wide-brimmed hat, a pointed cap, sometimes made from various patches, a cap, and more. According to other beliefs, Leshy always has an uncovered head. Some versions state that Leshy is always belted, while others claim he is always without a belt. The typical footwear for Leshy is bast shoes, sometimes enormous. He is often caught weaving or digging in them, sitting on a stump under the moonlight. He also wears boots, and sometimes walks barefoot. The left side of Leshy's clothing is fastened on the right (contrary to men's customary practice), with the right side sometimes "tucked in," and his shoes are occasionally worn on the wrong feet. Leshy is often depicted as a forester or a soldier, usually with shiny buttons. In later folk tales, Leshy is dressed in modern clothing: a cap, boots or shoes, etc. Sometimes he wears attire atypical for the forest, such as a black suit. Overall, the color of Leshy's clothing varies: the colors of the forest are green and tawny, the colors of the otherworldly realm are white and black, and their blend is gray, demonic red associated with the color of blood, and blue. In his hands, Leshy usually carries a whip, a lash, a cudgel, or a basket, indicating his connection to the forest and his patronage over animals. Leshy is often seen naked. It was believed that a strong wind accompanies Leshy from both the front and the back, indicating the direction in which it is heading. This wind sweeps away the tracks of Leshy, hence, according to one version, nobody ever saw them (although in other stories, Leshy does leave traces). Leshy itself can take the form of a powerful wind, whirlwind, as well as storms, rain, and fog. In this form, it raises dust on the road, tears off roofs of houses, and topples trees. In some regions, the image of Leshy as a whirlwind was the most common, and in certain places, any kind of bad weather was identified with it. There is a belief that Leshy lacks a shadow. This enigmatic creature can be invisible to humans, disappearing suddenly or gradually. It is said that to catch a glimpse of the true form or the invisible nature of Leshy, one must peer through the right ear of a horse or through a bridle, while sitting between three harrows. Northern Russian folklore claims that Leshy wears an invisible cap, but it can be revealed by using the plant known as Ivan's (or Adam's) Head and stealing the cap from him. In certain tales, the only manifestation of Leshy is an inexplicable and sometimes collective fear that arises unexpectedly in the forest. According to mythological tales, the auditory manifestations of Leshy are both clamorous (often resonating throughout the entire woodland, deafening humans) and diverse (encompassing all sounds that can be heard or imagined in the forest): whistling, laughter, clapping, bellowing cries, singing, the voices of various animals, the howling of the wind, humming, crackling, and rustling. In this way, Leshy asserts its superiority over humans, expressing dissatisfaction, striving to scare, jest, and lead astray with false sounds. In numerous stories, Leshy speaks in human-like manner. Often, it mimics people, much like an echo, which was considered its response in the forest. However, at times it is deliberately silent, and in some places it was even believed that it could not speak. Humans could hear the sounds of Leshy's wedding procession: the hoofbeats of horses, tinkling bells, harmonicas, and songs. In the tales and folklore, encounters with Leshy are described in any part of the forest, as well as in fields and even villages, at any time of the day. According to beliefs, Leshy dwells in old dry trees (such as fir and willow), in hollows, in stumps, in upturned roots, in fallen logs, in woodland huts, in secret caves, and even underground. It is said that a person will inevitably get lost near Leshy's dwelling. According to other beliefs, Leshy resides deep within the forest, protected by dense, impassable thickets and fallen trees, which remain unfrozen even during winter marshes. Animals of the forest and birds live alongside the "master". There are superstitions that forest creatures gather there before their death. Often, Leshy is depicted as a solitary being, with only one Leshy inhabiting each forest (large forests may be divided into sections, each with its own leshy). However, in some mythological tales, leshy creatures can gather together, living in families (Leshy's wife is called a leshachikha or a kidnapped maiden, and their children are either their own offspring or also kidnapped children), and even in villages: Leshy's homes are covered in animal hides, guarded by dogs, and they keep livestock; there are stories of leshy leaders and kings; the head of Leshy is referred to as the forest chief, the woodland king, the forest dweller, Musail-les, the honorable woodsman. Leshy can move along human roads, but in the forest, they have their own invisible paths that do not coincide with those of humans, and it is dangerous for a person to wander onto them - one can easily get lost. There was a belief that not all Leshy creatures are active throughout the day, but only during certain transitional hours: at night (especially at midnight), at dawn, at noon, or at an undefined "evil hour". The perceptions of the nature of Leshy are also contradictory. On one hand, Leshy is often depicted as having a majestic demeanor, yet on the other hand, they enjoy jesting, revelry, drinking, and playing cards. Leshy is attributed to all the phenomena caused by gusts of wind in the forest: howling, the crackling of trees, and the rustling of leaves. The fallen trees and roofs torn off by hurricane winds in some regions are associated with the noisy weddings of Leshy, which they celebrate during the summer. Leshy enjoys hanging and swaying on tree branches, which is why in certain places it has been called the "swinger". It often sits on a tree or stump, weaving bast shoes or crafting wooden trinkets. Leshy can engage in feuds among themselves (tales speak of battles between spirits, using trees and boulders as weapons), as well as with demons, water spirits, field spirits, and house spirits. It was believed that as the master, Leshy takes care of the forest and protects it. Leshy acts as the shepherd of all woodland creatures, depicted as an old man with a staff in his hand. He herds the animals, ensures their nourishment, defends them from hunters, and saves them from fires. Leshy governs the animals under his dominion as his own property, for instance, he may gamble them away in a game of cards to another forest spirit - this served as a mystical explanation for mass animal migrations such as squirrels, hares, and others. However, Leshy is often portrayed as the patron of only one or a few species of wild animals, most commonly bears and particularly wolves (Leshy can manifest as a white wolf - the pack leader). A series of dates in the folk calendar are associated with Leshy. The presence of Leshy was particularly common before Great Lent, Palm Sunday, and on the night of Ivan Kupala on June 24 (July 7). It is believed that Leshy, like other spirits, celebrates the arrival of spring and Easter (the best gift for Leshy on this day being an Easter egg). On George's Day in Spring, April 23 (May 6), or around St. Nicholas' Day, May 9 (May 22), shepherds could make agreements with Leshy. Hunters most often made agreements with Leshy on Easter and on the night of Ivan Kupala. On the night of Agafon the Monk, August 22 (September 4), Leshy would leave the forest and run through the villages, scattering sheaves in the threshing floors and causing mischief in general. Peasants would guard the sheaves from Leshy at night, walking around the sheaves in a circle with a poker, as if enclosing them with a fence. The Feast of the Cross, September 14 (September 27), was also considered a special day for Leshy, when they would drive forest animals into special places to play cards with them. Peasants would avoid going into the forest on this day so as not to stumble upon the gathering of Leshy. On St. Erofey's Day, October 4 (October 17), Leshy would stop wandering through the forest, as they would sink into the ground and only reappear in the spring. Parting ways with the forest for the winter, Leshy would become agitated, dissatisfied, and melancholic, causing winds, breaking trees, digging up the earth, and scattering all the animals to their burrows. It was considered dangerous to go into the forest on this day, as Leshy could lose their mind. Leshy would only reappear in the spring, when the snow began to melt. However, according to equally prevalent beliefs, Leshy would remain in the forest during the winter, causing blizzards. Like other unclean spirits, Leshy could manifest themselves during the Christmas season. The origins of Leshy have been shrouded in ambiguity. Folklore suggests that Leshy are formed from cursed individuals, children traded with dark forces, restless souls, or descendants of unions between demons and witches. In popular Christianity, relatively recent motifs propose that Leshy, like all impure forces, is either a celestial being expelled from the heavens and consigned to the depths of the forest, or a manifestation devised by the Devil himself, endeavoring to replicate God's divine act of shaping humanity, only to be cast down to the earthly realm. Furthermore, Leshies are perceived as an unacknowledged progeny stemming from the lineage of Adam and Eve, or alternatively, as the cursed offspring of various condemned figures, forsaken by the divine. Like the various variations of the Nixie throughout European folklorical traditions the leshy is said to kidnap maidens for a wife. Leshovika may sometimes be meant to denote both the wife and daughters of the leshy. They appear as beautiful women, but are often depicted as completely nude or dressed in white. They could also be ugly old women or appear as a woman as tall as trees (similarly to the leshy) The existence of the Russian peasant was intimately intertwined with the forest, upon which their livelihoods hinged. Within the forest, every aspect of agricultural labor unfolded, with slash-and-burn techniques carefully adhered to. Cattle grazed contentedly amidst the trees, while wood was selectively harvested for both construction and warmth. The pursuit of mushrooms, berries, and fishing opportunities thrived within this woodland realm, alongside the extraction of tar and the burning of charcoal. Crucially, the forest served as a vital thoroughfare for roads, while also playing host to various pagan rituals. However, despite mankind's active engagement with the forest and its proximity to their mastered territory, it remained an enigmatic and perilous domain. It was regarded as an otherworldly realm, teeming with impure forces and beyond the grasp of human control. The perception of Leshy, as a forest guardian, was ambiguous among the people. On one hand, Leshy was considered a hostile and dangerous force, sometimes even mistaken for a demon. On the other hand, it was often contrasted with "real" demons: its negative actions were not intended to harm humans, but rather to punish (even with death) for improper behavior in the forest, and sometimes for breaking societal rules. According to folklore, Leshy didn't intentionally harm people, but rather played tricks and pranks, albeit in a crude and malicious manner: it scared people with laughter and clapping, led them astray, hid their hats and baskets, silently made them sleep on anthills, forced them to climb trees, offered pine cones disguised as a drink, removed wagon wheels, and more. However, Leshy was also seen as a benevolent and just spirit, who wouldn't harm humans without reason. It could help gather mushrooms or berries, show the way if asked, and take care of a lost child. Leshy determined the success of hunting and the prosperous grazing of livestock. Numerous mythological tales depict the struggle between humans and Leshy, in search of a compromise. This ambivalent attitude was also evident in the portrayal of Leshy, sometimes as a powerful and terrifying spirit, against whom only prayers or magic (mainly in folk beliefs) could provide protection, and other times as a simple folk demon, easily outsmarted by a clever peasant (mostly in fairy tales and similar narratives). According to folk etiquette, when going to the forest, one should pray and ask permission to enter it from Leshy as the "master of the forest". It was also necessary to ask for Leshy's consent to any activity in the forest. One should not, when going to the forest, say that you are going for a short time - it is not for a man to decide, but for the forest. It was very dangerous to get a curse from a relative before going to the forest, as Leshy believed that "cursed people" were promised to him. Leshy does not like it when in the forest swear, make noise, sing, and even more so whistle - it is his prerogative, he may take offense and hurry to respond with his destructive whistle. Do not imitate the echo and respond to an unfamiliar voice - it may be Leshy. Protecting the forest, Leshy can prevent a man from cutting trees (hides axes, scatters logs), and even more so to maim them unnecessarily, and hunting (diverts the shot, deprives marksmanship and generally the ability to shoot, lures into impassable places). A person who stays overnight in a forest hut without being asked, Leshy tries to frighten with noise, shouts of animals and birds, opening doors, etc., and expel him, maybe even kill him. It is not allowed to lie down for the night and make a fire on the trail, and especially at the crossroads, as it can run over Leshy moving along it or a whole wedding or funeral procession of Leshy. Leshy likes to warm himself by a human fire, but, when angry, he can scatter or trample it. If a person behaving badly in the forest, Leshy could scare him half to death, frighten him with visions, make him sick, tickle him to death (for the latter he was sometimes called a tickler). If a person fell ill and it was believed that it happened in the forest, Leshy was petitioned to recover. However, sometimes Leshy could harm a person without any apparent reason. The hunters firmly believed that their success in hunting was dependent upon Leshy, who was responsible for distributing the bounties of the forest to humans. To ensure a prosperous hunt, it was customary to make a pact with Leshy (preferably on Easter or the night of Ivan Kupala), by offering a gift such as the cherished 'first god' Easter egg, bread with salt (mixed with one's own hair or nails), or a sacrificial offering of one's own blood (from a finger or the first kill). Alternatively, a blood pact could be written to solidify the agreement on paper or the leaf of a plant. The gift was to be left at the base of an uprooted tree or at the intersection of forest paths, and the person was required to remove their belt (considered an amulet) and make the sign of the cross (an act of renunciation of Christianity). Leshy himself would instruct the hunter on how to finalize the pact. The individual would then promise to fulfill certain conditions, such as not taking more prey than agreed upon, or refraining from hunting on specific days. This pact with Leshy had to be kept secret. Additionally, to ensure good luck in hunting, spells and incantations were performed to appeal to the forest spirit. By honoring the pact, Leshy would bring flocks of animals under the hunter's aim or lead them into their traps, and guarantee accurate shots. Breaking the pact or revealing its contents would result in losing the protection of the forest master and could result in dire consequences such as sickness or death. The hunter's pact with Leshy involved surrendering himself to the creature's control, and as Christianity became more widespread, it became associated with selling one's soul to the devil. To enter into a contract with Leshy, it was customary to place a cross under the heel, bury it in the ground, or shoot icons, sacred gifts, or a cross with a gun, and then smear the gun with the resulting blood. In many regions, herds of cattle were grazed in the forests, and in order to protect them from predators and prevent loss, the shepherd would perform a ritual round, known as a 'vacation', at the beginning of the season, during holidays like Egoriy or Nikola. This involved walking around the herd three times while carrying an icon and other 'magical' objects, reciting incantations. It was believed that if the ritual was performed with mistakes, Leshy, offended by the use of magic against it (as it was believed to be the cause of all misfortunes with the cattle in the forest), could seek revenge on humans by attacking the animals. For this reason, it was often more preferable to make a deal with Leshy for a 'divine' (or 'blessed') vacation rather than risk the 'terrible' or 'unblessed' vacation. This required the shepherd to perform a ritual round around the herd, as well as sit on an aspen stump or fallen birch on the same day or the day before and call upon Leshy using a magic formula, offering him gifts such as an Easter egg, bread with salt, or one to two cows. The act of 'bequeathing' a cow to Leshy meant that the cow would either perish or disappear during the season. In other customs, instead of summoning Leshy, a gift was left under a birch tree with an instruction to 'look at it'. The agreement with Leshy was formed through a strict, yet undefined, formula known as the covenant, but it was never recorded in writing. The shepherd also left a key-lock in the forest to secure the pact. It was believed that while the cows were grazing, Leshy would unlock it and lock it again when the cows had to return to the village. After the contract was sealed, it was believed that the cows were no longer under the shepherd's care, but were instead looked after by Leshy, their assistant (or a leshatchikha). Consequently, the shepherd no longer had to spend the day in the forest with the cows; they were free to tend to their own tasks and only needed to intervene when it was time to bring the cows back to the herd. Moreover, the shepherd had the ability to summon any cow back from the forest by blowing a trumpet. However, once the shepherd had made an agreement with Leshy, they were required to adhere to several prohibitions throughout the entire season. They were not allowed to watch over the cows in the forest, harm them, kill any animals in the forest, damage trees, collect berries (especially blackberries) or mushrooms, swear, cut their hair or nails, graze while wearing their own clothes, lend their pipe or batog to anyone else, touch other individuals (such as shaking hands, sharing utensils, bathing together, or sleeping with a woman), witness dead or newborn beings, sell cattle from the herd, scratch the wool of sheep, or disturb the hedges. They were filled with fear at the mere thought of breaking these taboos, knowing it could result in the nullification of their agreement, the demise of their livestock, and possibly even the shepherd. The belief was that Leshy had the power to take cattle from people, specifically those who had been cursed and were sent 'to the woodsman'. Leshy, on the other hand, would punish those who showed negligence towards their cattle, warning them that the animals would not go anywhere without his permission. It was believed that if an animal ended up in a place where Leshy had been, it could potentially become lost. Leshy had the ability to 'tie' the cattle to a tree, preventing it from moving and causing it to starve, or 'hide' it in another world, where its bell could still be heard nearby. In some cases, Leshy would even take care of the stolen cattle, grazing and milking them. At times, Leshy would unleash other wild animals, such as wolves or bears, to harm the cattle that were being watched by an incompetent shepherd. In order to locate missing cattle, peasants would not only perform traditional searches, but also engage in the ritual of 'tasting' or 'turning away'. This involved going to a crossroads in the forest or sending someone who was knowledgeable in this matter, to negotiate with Leshy. Offerings of eggs, bread with salt, and other small gifts wrapped in a clean cloth and tied with a red thread were presented to appease Leshy. Prayers, spells, and references to the saints were also used to seek Leshy's intervention. Leshy was seen as the primary reason for a person getting lost in the forest, which is why it was also called the one who "lures", "leads astray", "leads away". A person cannot find their way because Leshy has "encircled" them, creating an invisible circular boundary, thus separating them from this world into another. Even those who "follow Leshy's trail" will get lost and end up on his path. Leshy can block the way with illusions - a fallen tree, a river, and so on. He can also "hide" the lost person - people hear that he is nearby, but cannot find him. Leshy can "tie" a person to the tree in which he lives, causing the wanderer to keep returning to it. He can distort natural signs and landmarks that the person used as guides. Leshy can lure a hunter into the thicket by pretending to be a fleeting animal, sometimes strange. He can mimic the voice of a familiar, crying child or a dying person. Leshy can take on the appearance of a familiar or unknown companion and, distracting with conversation or promises of showing places rich in mushrooms or berries, lead them into an impassable place before disappearing; his appearance in such cases is often related to the person's desire for a companion. The lost person finds themselves in an unfamiliar place, which is understood in everyday terms as inaccessible, and in mythological terms as another world. However, when the enchantment fades, the person may discover themselves not far from familiar places. Also, pretending to be a familiar person, Leshy can lead the way ahead at a distance, not allowing himself to be caught up with and not responding. This companion disappears suddenly, often at the border with the cultural world - when crossing a bridge or a fence, usually laughing.</ref> According to beliefs, there are various methods to rid oneself of Leshy. If Leshy is perceived as an impure entity, one can seek assistance through prayer, making the sign of the cross, or invoking the name of God. However, if Leshy is regarded as an ancient deity, a more effective approach would be to use profanity, as well as attempting to amuse and ridicule Leshy. To conclude a conversation with Leshy, it is necessary to utter the "backward word," which is the first word spoken by either Leshy or the individual, thus completing the verbal circle. To protect oneself from Leshy, one can employ certain protective items such as salt and fire, a circle delineated by a "magical" object, a cleansed lime stick called a lutoshka, a head-shaped talisman, or a rowan tree. Leshy fears dogs and tricolored cats, and can be driven away with a forceful strike. Firearms, especially those loaded with copper button bullets, are particularly effective in instilling fear in Leshy. To break Leshy's spell on a lost individual, it is necessary for them to remove all their clothing and put it on inside out: reversed, backwards, and swapping footwear, including inverting the insoles and so forth. During the process of undressing, it is essential to loudly express anger and strike the clothing against a tree, while when dressing, one should recite prayers and incantations. Similarly, if one is lost while riding in a carriage, it is advisable to reverse the horses' harness. One could also attempt to exit the forest backwards along their own tracks. Additionally, one can simply ask Leshy to point the way. Similar to other demonic characters, Leshy is capable of kidnapping people. Individuals of any age and gender can fall into the pitfall. Often, the trigger for abduction is a curse, particularly a parental curse that sends the child "to Leshy." If the "cursed child" is successfully baptized, Leshy waits for their 7th birthday before luring them into the forest. In exchange for the abducted infant, leshy sometimes leaves a "changeling" in the cradle - a log or bundle of straw, or occasionally their own offspring, distorted and grotesque; the changeling is malevolent, cries a lot, cannot walk or talk, shows no signs of intelligence, and eventually disappears or dies, or escapes into the forest upon reaching a certain age, or if remaining among people, becomes a sorcerer. According to some stories, leshy treat abductees well: feeding and raising them - granting them secret knowledge, turning them into sorcerers and healers. Leshy take abducted girls as their wives and may have children with them. If a woman gives birth to a child fathered by a leshy and lives in a village, her child soon disappears. Leshy can also abduct a person with the intention of turning them into a slave. Often, the abducted become invisible to people, although they can see their loved ones, hear their conversations, experience separation, but cannot reveal themselves. In other stories, the missing individuals become wild, stop understanding speech and wearing clothes, become overgrown with moss and bark, bite and run away from people. There are also tales in which the "abducted" (lost) people perish from exhaustion, hunger, falling into a pit, or getting stuck in a swamp. It was believed that one could protect themselves from abduction immediately after being cursed by using Christian means (praying, crossing oneself, remembering God, performing a prayer) or pagan methods (saying "stay away from me", reciting spells, performing a ritual of "tasting"), or simply by quickly realizing and catching up with the "abductor" in the forest. In order to find a lost person in the woods, people would perform the same ritual of "tasting" ("turning away") as they would with a lost domestic animal, only the offerings were more valuable - not just bread and salt, but also pancakes, pies, a pot of porridge, a piece of fat. Relatives sought help against the forest spirit from the household spirit, calling out to him through a pipe. It was believed that a person kidnapped by the forest spirit should not eat the food of the forest spirits in order to return home (but in other stories, people were treated by the forest spirit and returned, although the food they brought with them turned into cones, moss, etc.). If an agreement was reached with the forest spirit, he would show the lost person the way out or even lead them out of the forest himself, or "reveal" them to the searchers - the missing person could be found in a place where they had already searched unsuccessfully. The forest spirit had different reactions to parting with the abducted person: with joy and a lesson to not bother him anymore, with irritation that they had been needlessly disturbed, or with reluctance, trying to keep their victim. The forest spirit could return a person long abducted by him as a reward for someone else helping him, or out of no longer needing them when the person aged, or marry off the girl abducted by him in childhood to humans. There was a belief that those who returned from the realm of Leshy underwent a profound transformation. They would learn to speak anew, their minds would become damaged or, conversely, they would become focused and serious, acquiring the abilities of sorcery, fortune-telling, and communication with spirits (such as the forest spirit or house spirits). Those who had returned felt a strong pull back to the forest, often avoiding human contact and struggling to create families. They would not divulge everything about their time with the forest spirit, as doing so could cost them their lives. For young women (referred to as "forest maidens" in Smolensk), the influence of their abduction would fade after marriage. Mythological tales encompass several methods through which one could summon Leshy. According to one of these methods, one must gather young birch trees, arranging them in a circular formation with their tops at the center. Stepping into this circle, one is to remove their cross and exclaim loudly, "Grandfather!" Another approach involves felling a pine tree with a blunt axe within the depths of the forest, ensuring that it topples onto two aspen trees. Standing upon this fallen cluster, facing north, one can then beckon Leshy. At night on Ivan Kupala, you can cut down an aspen so that it falls to the east, stand on a stump, face east, bend down, look between your legs and say: “Uncle Leshy! Show yourself to be neither a gray wolf, nor a black raven, nor a fire spruce, show yourself as I am.” There are several alternative methods to consider: refrain from praying at night and instead contemplate the devil before going to bed; sit on a pine stump and doze off three times; upon leaving the house, use your left hand to close the door, then venture into the forest and unearth an anthill with your left foot, cut off the top of a birch tree with your left hand, and exclaim “Ooh!”; fell an aspen tree, remove a chunk and a splinter from it three times; during the night in the forest, remove your cross and bury it in the ground while saying, “Lord of the forests, I have a request for you!” The practice of divination was common among the people, often taking place on Christmas Eve in the forest at night, typically at a crossroads. Fortune-tellers would create three circles around themselves using a magical object or the skin of an animal, and would ask Leshy about the future for the coming year. The response would be interpreted from various forest sounds. It was believed that Leshy would only answer three questions, and failure to follow the ritual could result in consequences. It was also believed that on Maundy Thursday, one could sit on an old birch tree in the forest, call upon Leshy ("Forest King, father to all animals, appear here!"), and inquire about the future. Additionally, Leshy could predict the future of a person he encountered, and in some regions, his appearance was seen as a sign of trouble ahead. When discussing encounters with Leshy, as well as other malevolent entities, the use of words such as 'seems', 'sees', 'beckons', 'frightens', and other expressions of uncertainty is common. However, there are tales in which Leshy is able to communicate with humans without any hindrance. These stories depict Leshy visiting pubs and drinking vodka, hiring humans as employees, visiting people's homes, and even acting as a matchmaker for a girl he fancies. On the other hand, there are also stories in which Leshy is portrayed as an ogre, riding on humans transformed into horses, carrying humans on his back, and stealing food and supplies from people. In some cases, Leshy even seeks help from humans, asking them to teach him to play the harmonica, provide him with food, or assist in childbirth. In return, Leshy shows gratitude and may help the human become wealthy, give them magical items, or even take their place in battle. It is believed that during human wars, Leshy and other forest spirits may also engage in conflicts with each other. Leshy is often used in swear words, although the term may be replaced with 'devil' in some cases. The Wood Demon (Leshy) 1889 by Anton Chekov is both named after and features a character who is nicknamed after the leshy due to his devotion to the forests. Leshy is used as a prototype for the main character of Vladimir Vysotsky's song "Lukomorye", which depicts Leshy as an alcoholic who spends all his money on drinking and is abusive to his wife. Leshy was the inspiration for an antagonist of the video-game Inscryption, who is also named "Leshy". In Karol Kalinowski [pl]'s comic-book Łauma the main protagonist is guarded by the Yotvingians' version of Leshy, the Lauma. They also appear on the cover. The name "Leshy" can designate a type of ghillie suit used by military personnel for camouflage in forests and grassy fields. The character "Lesh" appears as the guardian of the forest in Mavka, the highest-grossing Ukrainian film based on the 1918 play The Forest Song by poet Lesya Ukrainka A leshy appears as a major character by the name "The Leszy" in A.B.
