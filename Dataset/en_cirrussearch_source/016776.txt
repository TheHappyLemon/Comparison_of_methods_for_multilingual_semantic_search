My mom and my mom’s sister were on a kick with J names … my cousins names are Jessica, Jenna, Jade, Jaelyn and James. My oldest brother is Justin and my name is Jrue (my mom liked the name Dru, but wanted to figure out how to keep with the J theme). After me though, that kinda ended, because my sister is Lauren and brother is Aaron. —Holiday, on the story behind his first name. Both of Holiday's brothers, Justin and Aaron are also NBA players. His younger sister, Lauren, played college basketball on the UCLA women's team. In July 2013, Holiday married United States women's national soccer team midfielder Lauren Cheney. The two first met at a UCLA women's basketball game during his only season at the school. While he was approaching his seat, a young girl asked if he was Darren Collison and asked for his autograph. After explaining that he was not Collison and preparing to take his seat, Cheney, who was seated behind him, said, "Don't worry, you're cuter than Darren is." At the time, both were in relationships with others, but they became friends, and began dating after he was drafted by the Sixers. They later began hosting annual combo basketball and soccer clinics at UCLA. In September 2016, Holiday took indefinite leave from the Pelicans to care for his wife after she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The following month, Lauren had brain surgery only weeks after giving birth to the couple's daughter, J.T. (Jrue Tyler). Holiday and his wife Lauren had their second child, a boy named Hendrix, in late 2020. Holiday is a Christian. Holiday has said, “I'm a Christian athlete who has faith in Jesus Christ. So when I encounter circumstances over which I have no control, I believe and have peace.” List of NBA career assists leaders List of NBA career turnovers leaders Hayes, Marcus (June 25, 2018).
