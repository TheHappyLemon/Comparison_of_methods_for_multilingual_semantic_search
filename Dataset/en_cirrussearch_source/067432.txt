Pom Alexandra Klementieff (French: [pɔm klemɑ̃tjɛf]; born 3 May 1986) is a French actress. She is known for playing Mantis in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and Paris in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. Klementieff was born in Quebec City, Canada, to a Korean mother, Yu Ri Park, and Russian-French father Alexis Klementieff, who was working there as a consul with the government of France. Her grandfather was Russian painter Eugene Klementieff. Her parents chose the name "Pom" because it is similar in pronunciation to the Korean words for both "spring" (봄) and "tiger" (범). She is a French citizen and does not have Canadian citizenship because jus soli does not apply to children of diplomats. Klementieff lived in Canada for one year before her family began traveling extensively due to her father's job. They lived in Japan and Ivory Coast before settling in France. Klementieff's father died of cancer when she was five, and her mother had schizophrenia and was unable to care for children, so Klementieff was raised by her paternal uncle and aunt. Her uncle, whom she described as "like [her] second father", died on her 18th birthday, and her older brother Namou died by suicide seven years later, on her 25th birthday. Klementieff briefly studied law in an undergraduate capacity after her uncle's death to appease her aunt, but did not find it appealing. She also worked as a waitress and saleswoman in France. She started acting at age 19 at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris. A few months into her education, she won a theater competition and two years of free classes with the school's top teachers. Klementieff's first professional acting job was the French independent film Après lui (2007), portraying the stepdaughter of the protagonist played by Catherine Deneuve. Filming for her scenes took three days. In one scene, Klementieff was supposed to push someone down a set of stairs but accidentally fell down the stairs herself, and director Gaël Morel kept that shot in the final film. Her first leading role was in Loup (2009), a French film about a tribe of reindeer herders in the Siberian mountains. During filming, Klementieff stayed in a camp, hours from the nearest village, where temperatures dropped well below zero. She befriended nomads who lived there, worked with real wolves, rode reindeer, and swam with a horse in a lake. Klementieff made her Hollywood debut in Spike Lee's Oldboy (2013), a remake of the South Korean film of the same name. She portrayed Haeng-bok, the bodyguard of the antagonist played by Sharlto Copley. A fan of the original film, Klementieff heard about the part through Roy Lee, a producer with the remake, and took boxing lessons after learning the role involved martial arts. After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition, Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make-up, like her character in the film. She contributed some of her own clothes to the character's wardrobe, and trained three hours a day for two months for an on-screen fight with star Josh Brolin. Klementieff herself came up with the name Haeng-bok, Korean for "happiness", after Lee asked her to research possible names for the character. Klementieff moved to Los Angeles after Oldboy was filmed and began pursuing more Hollywood auditions. She continued taekwondo after the film, and has a purple belt as of the summer of 2014. Her next acting role was the film Hacker's Game (2015), in which she plays a hacker she compared to Lisbeth Salander from the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film, and due to the movie's low budget, she had to do her own make-up and choose her own wardrobe. It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role, to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced. In 2017, she appeared in the romance drama Newness and the black comedy-drama Ingrid Goes West. Klementieff received worldwide recognition when she joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Mantis, appearing in the films Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). In 2019, she appeared in an episode of the Netflix science fiction anthology series Black Mirror, the thriller film Uncut Gems, and had voice roles in the animated supernatural comedy film The Addams Family. In 2020, she had a recurring role as Martel in the HBO science fiction series Westworld. In 2023 she reprised her role as Mantis in the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and appeared as the enigmatic assassin Paris in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. She will reprise her role in the film's upcoming sequel in 2025. Klementieff is multilingual, and divulges that she learned English from watching American sitcoms. She was in a brief relationship[when?] with comedian and director Nicolas Bedos. "Stan Lee's Alliances : L'éclair du génie - Backstage avec Pom Klementieff". Audible. 10 October 2019.
