Kendrick Le'Dale Perkins (born November 10, 1984) is a former American professional basketball player who is a sports analyst for ESPN. He entered the NBA directly out of high school and played for the Boston Celtics, Oklahoma City Thunder, Cleveland Cavaliers, and New Orleans Pelicans, winning the NBA Championship in 2008 with the Celtics. Perkins was born in Nederland, Texas and raised by his grandparents, who lived on a farm. His mother was shot and killed by her best friend when Kendrick turned five. His father played professional basketball in New Zealand — where he stayed throughout — and never visited Perkins. Perkins went to a private Catholic school starting in sixth grade. Perkins' grandfather was very enthusiastic about sports, helping spark his competitive passion. In addition to basketball, Perkins also participated in pick-up football games as a defensive end, and baseball as a first baseman. Perkins stopped playing baseball in ninth grade, and gave up on football in tenth grade. Perkins first met LeBron James in the seventh grade when playing for Houston Hoops and competing against LeBron's Ohio Shooting Stars. Perkins later became friends with LeBron during his time at ABCD Camp where they were teammates on the Oakland Soldiers. During his time on the AAU circuit beginning in eighth grade, Perkins was ranked No. 3, LeBron at No. 1, and Chris Paul at No. 2. Perkins had his largest growth spurt from eighth grade to ninth grade, where he went from 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) to 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), his current height. Perkins' first in-game dunk was in the seventh grade. Perkins graduated from Clifton J. Ozen High School in Beaumont, Texas, in 2003. He led Ozen High to four consecutive district championships and one state championship during his high school career. Averaging 27.5 points, 16.4 rebounds and 7.8 blocked shots a game as a senior, he led Ozen to a 33–1 record, with the only loss being a 66–54 setback to Fort Worth Dunbar in the state 4A championship game. After his senior season in 2003, Perkins was selected to the McDonald's All-American Game. Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Perkins was listed as the No. 3 center and the No. 6 player in the nation in 2003. He had originally committed to Memphis, but opted instead to make the jump to the NBA straight out of high school. The 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) center was drafted in the first round with the 27th pick of the 2003 NBA draft by the Memphis Grizzlies, but was immediately traded along with Marcus Banks to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Troy Bell and Dahntay Jones, who had been selected by the Celtics in the same draft. During the 2004–05 season, Perkins received more playing time than he did his rookie season, and became known as one of the tougher players on the Celtics. He had a limited role during the regular season and playoffs as the team's "enforcer". Perkins was involved in an unusual scenario in the final seconds of regulation in Game 6 of the 2005 Eastern Conference first round against Indiana. Paul Pierce was ejected but Pierce was owed free throws because he had been fouled before the ejection. Under NBA rules, Indiana coach Rick Carlisle chose to select Perkins (who had not played in the game) off the bench to shoot the crucial free throws (the game was tied). Perkins missed both, indirectly leading the game going into overtime, in which the Celtics eventually won. After marked improvements during summer training and practice, Perkins earned more playing time from coach Doc Rivers during the 2005–06 season. He played some of the best games of his career in 2006, repeatedly reaching double figures in points and rebounds. After the trade of Mark Blount to the Minnesota Timberwolves, Perkins became the undisputed starting center for the Celtics, although he was already sharing starting time before Blount's departure. He started at center for the 2008 NBA champion Boston Celtics. In Game 6 of the 2010 NBA Finals, Perkins injured his knee and missed the rest of the game. He was inactive for Game 7, in which the Celtics fell to the Los Angeles Lakers. According to the Los Angeles Times, he suffered torn MCL and PCL ligaments in his right knee. Perkins did not return to the floor until January 25, 2011, when he logged 17 minutes off of the bench netting seven points, six rebounds and three assists in a win against the Cleveland Cavaliers. He received a standing ovation upon entering the game in the first quarter. After coming off the bench for his first 5 games back, Perkins returned to the starting line-up Friday, February 4 in a home loss to the Dallas Mavericks. He logged his first double-double of the season with 13 points, 12 rebounds and one blocked shot while shooting 6-for-7 from the field in 33 minutes. On February 24, 2011, Perkins and Nate Robinson were traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Jeff Green and Nenad Krstić. On March 1, he signed a multi-year extension with the Thunder. Perkins suffered a left knee sprain injury, which prevented him from debuting with the Thunder until March 14, 2011. On March 14, 2011, Perkins debuted with the Oklahoma City Thunder, recording six points, nine rebounds, and two assists during 20 minutes of play in a 116–89 win against the Washington Wizards. On March 20, 2011, Perkins recorded a season-high four assists, along with five points, 12 rebounds, and a steal, in a 95–93 loss to the Toronto Raptors. On March 25, 2011, Perkins recorded 13 points, five rebounds, three steals, and one block while going 6 for 6 from the field in a 111–103 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. On March 30, 2011, Perkins scored 13 points again, along with three rebounds, one assist, one steal, and one block in a 116–98 win over the Phoenix Suns. On April 6, 2011, Perkins grabbed a season-high 17 rebounds, while getting five points and one block in a 112–108 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. 10 of his 17 rebounds were offensive boards. According to ESPN, after grabbing 17 rebounds, Perkins said, "We've got goals at hand. When you have bigger goals, you tend to reach smaller goals. I guess that was a good thing to see the guys not comfortable. Our guys want to go a little further than just being division champs." The Thunder finished the season with 55 wins, clinching the fourth seed in the Western Conference. They went on versus the Denver Nuggets in the First Round of the 2011 NBA playoffs. On April 17, 2011, during Game 1 of the First Round, Perkins got four points, five rebounds, and one block in a 107–103 win against the Denver Nuggets. With just over a minute to go, Perkins scored a bucket to help the Thunder take the lead. This was later figured out as an offensive goaltending call. On April 27, 2011, Perkins got a near double-double, getting 13 points, nine rebounds and one assist during Game 5 of the First Round in a 100–97 win over the Denver Nuggets. On May 7, 2011, during Game 3 of the Western Conference Semifinals, Perkins grabbed 13 rebounds, while also getting six points, one assist, and one steal in a 101–93 overtime loss against the Memphis Grizzlies. He helped the Thunder get to the Western Conference Finals, but the team got eliminated in five games against the Dallas Mavericks. Perkins averaged 4.5 points, 6.1 rebounds and 0.8 blocks per game in the playoffs. The 2011–12 NBA season was shortened due to the collective bargaining agreement resulting in a lockout. During the 2011 NBA lockout, Perkins lost more than 30 pounds. On December 25, 2011, Perkins started the lockout-shortened season getting six points, four rebounds, one assist, and one block while also going 2 of 2 from the field in a 97–89 win against the Orlando Magic. Perkins made it on the 2012 NBA All-Star ballot, placing 6th out of the centers in the Western Conference. He got 66,380 votes.

I've been watching a lot of film and going to the gym and working on my game. I'm just trying to find an open spot when they get doubled."
