According to Metacritic, which calculated an average score of 55 based on six reviews, the album received "mixed or average reviews". Kyann-Sian Williams, writing for NME, called the album "better than last year's Skins, but still a case of diminishing returns" and "a serious case of over-embellishing thin material".
