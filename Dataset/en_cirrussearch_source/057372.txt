The New Zealand men's national ice hockey team is the national ice hockey team for New Zealand. As of 2018, the New Zealand team is ranked 39th in the IIHF World Rankings. The official nickname of New Zealand's national ice hockey team is the Ice Blacks. The "Ice Blacks" nickname is one of many national team nicknames related to the All Blacks.
