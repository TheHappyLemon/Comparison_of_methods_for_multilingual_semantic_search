Carl Kockelkorn (November 26, 1843 in Cologne – July 16, 1914 in Cologne) was a German chess composer. Together with Johannes Kohtz he founded the logical school of chess compositions. His problems were published as coproductions with Johannes Kohtz. For further information, see Johannes Kohtz#Kohtz and Kockelkorn. In his early years he called himself Kannengießer after the name of his stepfather. Kockelkorn worked as a private tutor in Cologne.
