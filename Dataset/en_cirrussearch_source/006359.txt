The final day was a controversial one, with the British and Slovene teams having to decide promotion based on overall goal differential. The British beat the Kazakhs by an improbable nine goals. When coach Chris McSorley was asked how much he paid the Kazakhs, he responded, "zero, you have not much confidence in your team, I think Slovenia can beat Estonia by at least 12 goals." The medal presentation was marred by Slovenian fans throwing debris on the ice when the Brits received their silver medals, the Kazakh team did not even attend to receive their bronze.
