The Gulf of Tolo (Indonesian: Teluk Tolo or Towori), also known as the Bay of Tolo, is the body of water lying between the eastern and south-eastern peninsulas of the island of Sulawesi (Celebes) in Indonesia. Unlike the Gulf of Tomini to its north or the Gulf of Boni to its south-west, the Bay of Tolo is not recognized as a gulf by the International Hydrographic Organization. Instead, it is included in the area of the Banda Sea. Gulf of Tomini Gulf of Boni IHO (1953), ยง48 (d). IHO (1953), ยง48 (k). IHO (1953), ยง48 (g). Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd ed.
