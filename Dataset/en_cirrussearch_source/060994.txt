Renan Augusto Lodi dos Santos (born 8 April 1998), known as Renan Lodi, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a left-back for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal and the Brazil national team. Born in Serrana, São Paulo, Lodi joined Athletico Paranaense's youth setup in 2012. He made his first team – and Série A – debut on 14 October 2016, starting in a 1–0 away loss against Grêmio. Lodi subsequently represented the under-23 in the Campeonato Paranaense, and scored his first senior goal on 25 March 2018, netting the opener in a 5–0 home routing of Maringá. Three days later, he extended his contract until March 2021. Lodi became a regular starter under new manager Tiago Nunes, and renewed his contract until 2022 on 10 August 2018. On 28 June 2019, La Liga side Atlético Madrid reached an agreement in principle with Athletico Paranaense for the transfer of Lodi. The deal was completed on 7 July 2019 and Lodi signed a six-year contract with the club. On 24 November 2019, Lodi scored his first goal for Atlético in a 1–1 draw with Granada. On 16 May 2021, Lodi came on as a substitute and scored a late equalizing goal in the eventual 2–1 home win over Osasuna that would keep the club in the title race against Real Madrid. The following week, as Atlético won the last game in the competition, Lodi became a 2020–21 La Liga champion as part of the team. On 15 March 2022, Lodi scored his first Champions League goal to help Atlético Madrid beat Manchester United 1–0 at Old Trafford and qualify for the quarter-finals, securing a 2–1 aggregate win. On 29 August 2022, Lodi signed for Premier League club Nottingham Forest on a season-long loan deal. He scored his first goal for Nottingham Forest on 9 November 2022 against Tottenham Hotspur in the EFL Cup. On 14 July 2023, Olympique de Marseille confirmed that they had reached an agreement to acquire Renan Lodi from Atlético Madrid, having already agreed personal terms with him, for a transfer fee of €13 million with a 20% sell-on clause. On 17 January 2024, Lodi signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal for a reported fee of €23 million. Lodi made his debut for the Brazil national team on 10 October 2019, replacing Alex Sandro in a 1–1 draw with Senegal.
