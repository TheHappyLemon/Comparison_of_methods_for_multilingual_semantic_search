Lias Andersson (born 13 October 1998) is a Swedish professional ice hockey forward for the Laval Rocket of the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the first round, seventh overall, by the New York Rangers in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. Andersson has also previously played for the Los Angeles Kings. Andersson made his Swedish Hockey League (SHL) debut with HV71 during the 2015–16 season. In the following 2016–17 season, able to accept a larger role, Andersson appeared in 42 games in the regular season, contributing with 9 goals and 19 points. He appeared in every postseason game in compiling 4 goals and 5 point in 16 games to help HV71 capture their fifth Le Mat Trophy. On 8 May 2017, Andersson opted to leave HV71 and agreed to a two-year contract to link up with Frölunda HC. It marked a return in continuing his heritage, as he spent his childhood with the club, as his father gained an icon status during his tenure with Frölunda. He was selected by the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL), seventh overall, in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. Following his selection by the Rangers, Andersson signed to a three-year, entry-level contract in July 2017. In the 2017–18 season, Andersson made his debut with Frölunda HC and appeared in 22 games, registering 7 goals and 14 points, before leaving the club to attend his second World Junior Championships. Following the conclusion of the tournament, Andersson left the SHL and was re-assigned by the Rangers to make his North American debut in joining their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack on 19 January 2018. On 25 March, Andersson was called up by the Rangers and made his NHL debut against the Washington Capitals at Madison Square Garden the next day. He scored his first career NHL goal in his debut, making him the youngest Rangers player to score a goal in their debut, surpassing Mike Allison. Andersson was subsequently sent back to the AHL thereafter. Andersson began the 2018–19 season in the AHL after being cut from the Rangers 2018 training camp. After recording 12 points in 14 games for the Hartford Wolf Pack, Andersson was recalled to the NHL on 5 November 2018. On 21 December 2019, it was reported by Darren Dreger that Andersson had formally asked the New York Rangers for a trade. However, on 26 January 2020, the Rangers opted to loan Andersson to HV71 of the SHL. Andersson's tenure with the Rangers officially ended in October 2020 as he was dealt to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Vegas' second-round pick in 2020. Andersson finished the season with HV71, playing 15 games and began the 2020–21 season with HV71, playing 19 games before coming to Los Angeles for NHL training camp. He split the NHL season between Los Angeles and their AHL affiliate, the Ontario Reign. Andersson scored his first goal for the Kings on 24 January 2021, against Ville Husso in a 6–3 win over the St. Louis Blues. On 30 July, Andersson re-signed with Los Angeles to a one-year, two-way contract. In the 2021–22 season, Andersson appeared in 20 games for the Kings, scoring one goal and two points. He signed a one-year extension with Los Angeles on 11 July 2022. The 2022–23 season saw Andersson spend the majority of the year with the Reign, appearing only once for Los Angeles. On 2 July 2023, Andersson as a free agent signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Montreal Canadiens. Andersson attended the Canadiens 2023 training camp but was placed on waivers with the intent on assigning him to Montreal's AHL affiliate, the Laval Rocket. After going unclaimed, Andersson was assigned to Laval to start the 2023–24 season. Andersson was named to Team Sweden for the 2016 IIHF World U18 Championships and helped Sweden win silver by putting up nine points in seven games. He was again named to Team Sweden for the 2017 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he scored three goals. He was named captain to Team Sweden for the 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he helped guide the team to a silver medal, and in a controversial display, threw it into the crowd in frustration. For this action, he was suspended from four games during the 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. In April 2018, he was named to Sweden's 2018 IIHF World Championship team, and Sweden won gold. Andersson's father Niklas played in 165 NHL games, while his uncle Mikael played in 761 NHL games.
