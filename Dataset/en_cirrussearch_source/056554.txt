The Bolshoy Anyuy (Russian: Большой Анюй; "Great Anyuy") is a river in the Kolyma basin in Far East Siberia. Administratively most of the basin of the Bolshoy Anyuy and its tributaries belong to the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia. It flows roughly westwards and passes through the sparsely populated areas of Chukotka, its valley forming the southern border of the Anyuy Range. The Maly Anyuy joins it from the north near the Sakha Republic border and the combined river (now called the Anyuy) properly flows about 20 kilometres (12 mi) to meet the Kolyma at Nizhnekolymsk. Its length is 693 kilometres (431 mi) and its basin area 57,300 square kilometres (22,100 sq mi). In 1650, Mikhail Stadukhin and Semyon Motora found a portage from the upper Bolshoy Anyuy to the upper Anadyr (probably its Yablon branch). This became the main cossack route from the Kolyma to the Pacific. "Река Бол. Анюй (в верховье Лев. Илюкэйвеем) in the State Water Register of Russia". textual.ru (in Russian).
