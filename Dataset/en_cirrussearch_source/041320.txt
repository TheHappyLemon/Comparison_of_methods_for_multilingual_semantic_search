On 21 November 2020, Gallese was again involved in a penalty shoot-out as Orlando played their first MLS playoff game in history against New York City FC. Gallese appeared to successfully save the fifth penalty kick which would have won the match for Orlando but the play was overturned by VAR and Gallese received a second yellow card for leaving his goal line early having already been booked in extra-time for time wasting. Ultimately Orlando won the match after defender Rodrigo Schlegel replaced Gallese in goal and saved a penalty in the seventh round of the shootout. In August 2021, Gallese was named an MLS All-Star for the 2021 MLS All-Star Game.
