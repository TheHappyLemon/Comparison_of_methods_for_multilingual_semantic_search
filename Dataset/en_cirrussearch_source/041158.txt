Michael Rico Lang (born 8 February 1991) is a Swiss professional footballer who plays as a defender for Swiss Super League club Basel and the Switzerland national team. Additionally, he has represented Switzerland internationally at youth level. In the year 2000 Lang joined the youth department of FC St. Gallen and in 2006 he advanced to play in their I-21 team, who played in the 1. Liga, at that time the third tier in the Swiss football league system. On the last matchday of the 2006–07 Swiss Super League season, on 24 May 2007, he played his domestic league debut for the first team in the away game as FCSG played a 1–1 draw against Aarau. He played his first league match at age 16, making him one of the youngest debut players in the Swiss Super League to that date. Lang remained with the U-21 team, but came to three appearances in their first team in the 2007–08 Swiss Super League, however FCSG suffered relegation. The following season FCSG won the 2008–09 Swiss Challenge League and as division champions won immediate promotion. Lang had nine appearances and scored one goal that season. Lang remained with the club for two further seasons. During his time with them he played 66 first team matches and scored four goals for them. In the summer 2011 he signed a four-year contract with Grasshopper Club Zürich, the Swiss record football champion. The Swiss Cup one of the semi-finals was the derby between Zürich and Grasshopper Club. FCZ went ahead in the first half, but GC were able to draw level before half time. No further goals fell and so the game went into extra time. Izet Hajrović scored the winning goal in the 94th minute and GC advanced to the final. This was played in the Stade de Suisse, Wankdorf, Bern on 20 May 2013 and FCB played against GC. In the 71st minute Markus Steinhöfer put Basel a goal up, but Izet Hajrović was able to equalise just four minutes later. No further goals fell, not during extra time either. It came to a penalty shootout and despite the fact that Lang himself didn't net his spot kick, GC won the shootout 4–3 and lifted the trophy. The Grasshopper Club played two years in a row the qualification for the UEFA Champions League. But they lost their games, in 2013–14 first leg 1–0 away from home and second leg also 1–0 at home against Lyon and 2014–15, first leg 2–0 at home and second leg with a 1–1 draw away against Lille OSC. In his four seasons with GC, Lang played 127 domestic league matches and he scored 12 goals. On 1 June 2015, Lang joined Basel on a free transfer. He joined Basel's first team for their 2015–16 season under new head coach Urs Fischer. After playing in three test games, Lang made his first team league debut on 19 July 2015 in the 2–0 home win against Vaduz. He scored his first goal for his new team just one week later on 25 July during the away game against his old club Grasshopper Club. It was the last goal of the game and Basel won 3–2. Under trainer Urs Fischer Lang won the Swiss Super League championship at the end of the 2015–16 Super League season During that season Lang had 22 league appearances, one in the Swiss Cup, four in that season's Champions League qualifying phase and ten appearances in the Europa League. He scored seven goals in these games. Again at the end of the 2016–17 Super League season Lang won the championship with the team. This was the club's eighth title in a row and their 20th championship title in total. They also won the Swiss Cup beating Sion 3–0 in the final on 25 May, which meant they had won the double. Lang had played 31 games in the league, five in the domestic Cup and five in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League. He scored six league goals and three in the cup. In the 2017–18 FC Basel season Raphaël Wicky was hired as new head coach, but the team ended that season as runners-up. Lang scored his first Champions League goal in the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League group stage home game on 27 September against Benfica. It was the first goal of the game that Basel went on to win 5–0. Following this, on 22 November, in the home game against Manchester United he scored the winning goal in the 89th minute as Basel won 1–0 to end the group in second position and advance to the next round. In the knockout phase, when playing Manchester City, Lang again scored the winning goal in the 71st minute as Basel won 2–1 and ended their opponent's 15-month unbeaten home run. Lang had 34 league appearances, two in the cup and eight in the Champions League. He scored a total of ten goals in these three competitions. In the 122 games that he had played for RotBlau, across all competitions, Lang had scored 26 goals and had prepared another 18.

He also had one appearance in the 2018–19 DFB-Pokal, a 5–0 home defeat against Bayer Leverkusen on 31 October. Werder Bremen (loan) On 29 August 2019, Lang joined SV Werder Bremen on a season-long loan deal for the 2019–20 Bundesliga season with an option to buy included. Initially Lang arrived as replacement for the injured Theodor Gebre Selassie and played four games in a row for over 90 minutes from the third to the sixth matchday, but after that he was hardly used anymore. That season Lang played nine times for Werder in the Bundesliga and once in the DFB Cup. After the loan ended, the option that he could he permanently signed was not exercised. After his loan period Lang went back returned to Gladbach for another season, however, it was a season to forget. He played only in two DFB Cup matches, both times coming on a substitute and once in the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League also as substitute in the away match against Shakhtar Donetsk. On 19 July 2021 FC Basel announced, that Lang had moved back to them, with immediate effect. The 30-year-old right-back signed a contract until the summer of 2023, with an option for a further year. He joined Basel's first team for their 2021–22 season under head coach Patrick Rahmen. The team started well into the league season with seven victories and five draws before their first defeat. They ended the campaign as runners-up, they had achieved 15 victories and were defeated only four times. However, they had given away too many points, because they could only achieve a draw on 17 occasions. In the 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League they won their group, but were knocked out in the round of 16 losing twice against Marseille. Lang totaled 39 appearances, 26 League, one Cup and 12 Conference League. He scored six goals in these matches. For their Basel's 2022–23 season Alexander Frei was hired as new head coach. However, the season didn't start well for the team, two defeats and three draws in the first six matches and things continued in that manor. In February Frei was replaced through Heiko Vogel, but at the end of the season Basel were in fifth position. Lang had 27 appearances, mainly in the starting eleven, scoring one goal. In the 2022–23 Swiss Cup the team advancedas far as the semi-finals. Lang had four appearances, also scoring once. In the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League the team were runners-up in their group, but advanced via the play-offs to the knockout phase, and then advanced as far as the semi-finals. Here they were matched against Fiorentina, winning the first leg 2–1 away, they lost the second leg at home in the St. Jakob-Park by the same score, thus they went into extra time. In the tenth minute of the added over-time in the second half of the extra time Basel conceded the decisive goal and were knocked out in the most bitter of ways. Lang had 15 appearances, scoring one goal here as well. Lang made his first senior international appearance for Switzerland on 14 August 2013 in the friendly against Brazil. He came on as a second-half substitute for Stephan Lichtsteiner as the team won 1–0 at St. Jakob-Park. He scored his first goal in his second appearance later on 11 October in the 2–1 win against Albania in match 9 of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification Group E; this win clinched Switzerland's place at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Switzerland was eventually knocked out of the tournament by Argentina in the round of 16.
