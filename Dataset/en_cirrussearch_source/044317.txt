Chile lays claim to being one of 14 nations to participate at the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics and made its debut appearance at the 1948 Winter Olympics. The national teams sent by Chile to each of the Olympic Games have been under the auspices of the Chilean Olympic Committee since its inception in 1934 and acceptance by the International Olympic Committee. Previous to the establishment of the Chilean Olympic Committee, athletes were sent to the Olympics under the auspices of the Chilean Athletics Federation. The athletes representing Chile at the Olympics have brought home a total of thirteen medals, with tennis as the top medal-producing sport. Chile has yet to win any medals at the Winter Olympics. A total of 30 athletes have won 13 Olympic medals for Chile. Only three athletes have won more than one medal: Óscar Cristi (two silver), Fernando Gonzalez (one gold, one silver and one bronze) and Nicolás Massú (two gold). The Chilean Olympic Committee claims Luis Subercaseaux as its first Olympic athlete, in 1896, competing in the 100, 400 and 800 metres; it is not clear whether he actually competed in any of the three events in which he was entered that year.
