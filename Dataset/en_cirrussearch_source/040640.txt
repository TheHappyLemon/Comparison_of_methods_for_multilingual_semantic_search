Vitória Futebol Clube is a Portuguese professional sports club based in the city of Setúbal. Popularly known as Vitória de Setúbal (pronounced [viˈtɔɾiɐ ðɨ sɨˈtuβal]), the club was born under the original name Sport Victoria from the ashes of the small Bonfim Foot-Ball Club. When it comes to main achievements in Portugal, Vitória de Setúbal have won six trophies: three Taça de Portugal and one Taça da Liga. Internationally, Vitória have won a Small Club World Cup and an Iberian Cup. Historically, it is one of the most decorated clubs in the country, apart from the Big Three. Vitória de Setúbal played in the inaugural Campeonato da Liga in 1934–35. In 1964–65, Vitória de Setúbal won their first Taça de Portugal, beating holders Benfica 3–1 in the final. After losing 1–0 to Braga in the next season's final, Vitória won the 1967 final by beating Académica de Coimbra 3–2 after extra-time. Vitoria competed in the European Cup-Winners' Cup in 1965-66 (losing 4–2 on aggregate in the first round to AGF Aarhus), and 1967-68 (losing 7–3 on aggregate to Bayern Munich in the second round). Vitória Setubal played in the Fairs Cup in 1969–70, knocking Liverpool out in the second round. In the next round, they were eliminated 2–1 on aggregate by Hertha BSC. In the 1973–74 season, Vitória de Setúbal finished in third place, four points behind champions Sporting CP. After another yo-yo period from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s, Vitória returned to the Portuguese top flight for the 2004–05 season. The same season saw them win their third Cup, beating holders Benfica 2–1 in the final on 29 May. On 13 August, the two clubs played the Super Cup against each other at the Estádio do Algarve, with Benfica winning 1–0. On 14 May 2006, Vitória lost the cup final by one goal to FC Porto. On 22 March 2008, Vitória won the Taça da Liga for the first time. In the final, they defeated Sporting on penalties following a goalless draw; on-loan goalkeeper Eduardo saved three times. Ten years later, the final went to penalties against the same opponent, who won this time. Vitória avoided relegation by one point in 2019–20, but due to failure to gain a licence for the new season, they were administratively relegated to the third-tier Campeonato de Portugal. Vitória were promoted after one season, but remained in the third division due to the creation of Liga 3; their registration was permitted due to their improved financial situation. In 2022–23, the team were relegated to the now fourth-tier Campeonato de Portugal on the final day despite beating F.C. Oliveira do Hospital on the final day, due to Sporting CP B's late winner over Real SC. Vitória plays at the Estádio do Bonfim, which was inaugurated in 1962 and has a capacity of 18,964.
