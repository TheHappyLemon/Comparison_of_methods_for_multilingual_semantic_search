Noteridae is a family of adephagan water beetles closely related to the Dytiscidae, and formerly classified with them. They are mainly distinguished by the presence of a distinctive "noterid platform" underneath, in the form of a plate between the second and third pair of legs. The family consists of about 230 species in 14 genera, and is found worldwide, more commonly in the tropics. They are sometimes referred to as burrowing water beetles. These beetles are relatively small, ranging from 1 to 6 mm, with smooth oval bodies ranging from light brown to a darker reddish brown. The head is short and somewhat covered by the prothorax. Both adults and larvae are aquatic, and are commonly found around plants. They have a habit of burrowing through pond and marsh substrate, thus the common name, and are primarily carnivorous, with some scavenging observed. Noteridae contains the following genera: Canthydrus Sharp, 1882 Hydrocanthus Say, 1823 Mesonoterus Sharp, 1882 Neohydrocoptus Satô, 1972 Noterus Clairville, 1806 Notomicrus Sharp, 1882 Phreatodytes Uéno, 1957 Pronoterus Sharp, 1882 Renotus Guignot, 1936 Siolius J.Balfour-Browne, 1969 Speonoterus Spangler, 1996 Suphis Aubé, 1836 Suphisellus Crotch, 1873 Synchortus Sharp, 1882 Nilsson, Anders N.
