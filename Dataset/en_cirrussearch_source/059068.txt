The 1987–88 European Cup was the 33rd season of the European Cup club football tournament. The competition was won for the first time by PSV Eindhoven, who defeated two-time winners Benfica in the final at Neckarstadion in Stuttgart. PSV became the first Dutch team to win the title in 15 years. They also set a record by winning only three matches on their route to the Cup, including no wins from the quarter-final onwards. Porto, the defending champions, were eliminated by Real Madrid in the second round. English clubs were still banned, following the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985, so Everton were denied a place in the competition for the second time in three years. 1 Partizani Tirana were disqualified due to the behaviour of their players and officials, including having four players sent off in their first leg. 16 September 1987 20:00 Stade de la Maladière, Neuchâtel Attendance: 12,200 Referee: René Bindels (Luxembourg) 16 September 1987 20:00 Olympiastadion, Munich Attendance: 17,500 Referee: Emilio Soriano Aladrén (Spain) 16 September 1987 21:45 Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Madrid Attendance: 499 Referee: Ioan Igna (Romania) 16 September 1987 22:30 Estádio das Antas, Porto Attendance: 30,000 Referee: Joël Quiniou (France) 16 September 1987 17:45 Åråsen Stadion, Lillestrøm Attendance: 1,123 Referee: Kaj Natri (Finland) 16 September 1987 20:30 Stade du Parc Lescure, Bordeaux Attendance: 12,798 Referee: Carlos Silva Valente (Portugal) 16 September 1987 19:30 Gerhard Hanappi Stadium, Vienna Attendance: 6,200 Referee: Janusz Eksztajn (Poland) 16 September 1987 19:30 Philips Stadion, Eindhoven Attendance: 26,000 Referee: José Rosa dos Santos (Portugal) 16 September 1987 16:00 Stadionul Steaua, Bucharest Attendance: 22,500 Referee: Velodi Miminoshvili (Soviet Union) 16 September 1987 20:30 Tolka Park, Dublin Attendance: 2,489 Referee: Jean-François Crucke (Belgium) 16 September 1987 18:00 Republican Stadium, Kyiv Attendance: 95,000 Referee: Franz Wöhrer (Austria) 16 September 1987 19:30 Stadio Georgios Karaiskakis, Athens Attendance: 39,092 Referee: Aron Schmidhuber (West Germany) 16 September 1987 19:00 Aarhus Idrætspark, Aarhus Attendance: 3,253 Referee: Jozef Marko (Czechoslovakia) 16 September 1987 22:00 Estádio da Luz, Lisbon Attendance: 45,000 Referee: José Pes Pérez (Spain) 16 September 1987 18:30 Laugardalsvöllur, Reykjavík Attendance: 871 Referee: Tore Hollung (Norway) 16 September 1987 19:00 Malmö Stadion, Malmö Attendance: 10,528 Referee: Manfred Roßner (East Germany) 30 September 1987 19:00 Lahti Stadium, Lahti Attendance: 2,218 Referee: Kurt Sørensen (Denmark) Neuchâtel Xamax won 6–2 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 19:00 Natsionalen Stadion Vasil Levski, Sofia Attendance: 8,000 Referee: Keith Hackett (England) Bayern Munich won 5–0 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 20:30 Stadio San Paolo, Naples Attendance: 83,231 Referee: Dieter Pauly (West Germany) Real Madrid won 3–1 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 17:00 Gradski Stadion Skopje, Skopje Attendance: 17,500 Referee: Paolo Bergamo (Italy) Porto won 6–0 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 19:30 Windsor Park, Belfast Attendance: 4,947 Referee: Eysteinn Guðmundsson (Iceland) Lillestrøm won 5–3 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 17:00 Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion, East Berlin Attendance: 18,345 Referee: Bob Valentine (Scotland) Bordeaux won 4–0 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 15:00 National Stadium, Attard Attendance: 500 Referee: Goce Popev (Yugoslavia) Rapid Wien won 7–0 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 15:00 Ali Sami Yen Stadium, Istanbul Attendance: 25,412 Referee: Lajos Németh (Hungary) PSV Eindhoven won 3–2 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 20:00 MTK Stadion, Budapest Attendance: 4,000 Referee: Dimitar Charlatchki (Bulgaria) Steaua București won 4–2 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 19:00 Makario Stadium, Nicosia Attendance: 15,269 Referee: Anton Vasilev (Bulgaria) Omonia won 1–0 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 19:30 Ibrox Stadium, Glasgow Attendance: 43,305 Referee: Ulf Eriksson (Sweden) Rangers won 2–1 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 17:00 Stadion Zabrze, Zabrze Attendance: 18,100 Referee: Philippe Mercier (Switzerland) Górnik Zabrze won 3–2 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 19:15 Stade de la Frontière, Esch-sur-Alzette Attendance: 1,600 Referee: Claude Bouillet (France) AGF Aarhus won 4–2 on aggregate. 30 September 1987 Partizani were disqualified due to the behaviour of their players and officials, having four players sent off in their first leg.
