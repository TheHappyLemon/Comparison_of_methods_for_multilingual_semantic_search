Daniel Moreno Fernández (born 5 September 1981) is a Spanish former professional road racing cyclist, who rode professionally between 2005 and 2018 for the Relax–GAM, Omega Pharma–Lotto, Team Katusha, Movistar Team and EF Education First–Drapac p/b Cannondale teams. He specialised in mountain and high-mountain races along with Grand Tours like the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a España, winning three stages of the latter in 2011 and 2013. In 2003, Moreno was a member of the Alcosto–Fuenlabrada team, and he won the Volta a Portugal do Futuro. From September 2004, Moreno rode as a stagiaire with Relax–Bodysol. At his very first race, the annual Tour of Britain, he achieved a prominent result by finishing 5th in the general classification. In 2005, he remained full-time with Relax–Fuenlabrada. He advanced further by ranking 2nd at the Clásica de Ordizia and the Vuelta a Andalucía. In 2006, he achieved his first victories by taking stage wins at the Clásica Internacional de Alcobendas and the Volta ao Alentejo. He supplemented his triumphs with three podiums at the Volta ao Alentejo, the Clásica Internacional de Alcobendas and the Vuelta a Burgos. In 2007 it also turned out to be successful year for Moreno. He won stages at the Tour de San Luis, Vuelta a Chihuahua, and the Escalada a Montjuïc. Along with that, he showed himself to good advantage by taking 2nd place in a stage of the Vuelta a España and, thus, reaching 12th position in the final general classification. In September he announced his move to French team Agritubel for the next year but then Moreno renounced his own statement. However, with the collapse of Relax–GAM in late 2007, the rider lost his permanent contract together with an opportunity to compete at professional races. Moreno managed to return to the peloton only in March 2008 after signing a contract with the Spanish team Caisse d'Epargne. There he spent two seasons (2008–2009) working as a domestique for Alejandro Valverde and then moved to Omega Pharma–Lotto for a year. In 2011 he joined Russian Team Katusha and became a domestique for his team leader, Joaquim Rodríguez. Accompanying Rodríguez in mountain races, Moreno managed to win several significant competitions including the Giro del Piemonte and the Vuelta a Burgos. On 23 August he triumphed in stage 4 of the Vuelta a España, joining the lone escapee of Chris Anker Sørensen in the final kilometres. Sorensen had been part of an earlier break and Moreno sat on his wheel, attacking in the final 400 metres (1,300 ft) as the peloton was charging behind. The next day he successfully assisted Rodríguez at Valdepeñas de Jaén. The coordinated performance of the two Spaniards brought Moreno to 3rd place while Rodríguez topped the podium. During all three weeks of the racem Moreno rode at his best and, thus, ranked 9th in the general classification. In October, Moreno won the Italian classic Giro del Piemonte, after shaking off the leading group of thirteen after the flamme rouge on an uphill false flat. In 2012 Moreno kept on going forward. He triumphed at the GP Miguel Induráin, took first place on stage 4 of the Vuelta a Andalucía and won 2 stages of the Critérium du Dauphiné. Moreno also firmly assisted Rodríguez to second overall at the Giro d'Italia. The Vuelta a España and other home races were among his top priorities for the ongoing season. He went on to win the 2.HC classified Vuelta a Burgos, surviving a scare in the last stage after getting dropped on the Lagunas de Neila [es] mountain finish by two serious overall classification contenders, Colombians Esteban Chaves of Colombia–Coldeportes and Sergio Henao of Team Sky. Moreno ultimately limited his losses to 22 seconds on that stage, retaining the leader's jersey by 10 seconds over Henao. He also won 2 stages and the points classification at the race. He also had a solid 5th-place finish in the Vuelta a España, where he helped his team leader Rodríguez in the mountain stages; Rodríguez took third overall. In 2013, Moreno won the World Tour race La Flèche Wallonne, after following an attack initiated by Philippe Gilbert (BMC Racing Team) on the final climb, the Mur de Huy. He passed Gilbert and Carlos Betancur (Ag2r–La Mondiale) to grab the victory. He later continued his good form into the Critérium du Dauphiné where he finished 3rd overall. At the Vuelta a España, he won stages 4 and 9 and finished 10th in the final general classification. In October 2015, Movistar Team announced that they had signed Moreno on a two-year contract from 2016. In November 2017, it was announced that Moreno was to join the EF Education First–Drapac p/b Cannondale team for the 2018 season. 2004 5th Overall Tour of Britain 2005 2nd Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 2nd Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia 6th Clásica a los Puertos de Guadarrama 2006 2nd Overall Volta ao Alentejo 1st Stage 3 3rd Overall Clásica Internacional de Alcobendas 1st Stage 1 3rd Overall Vuelta a Burgos 4th Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia 4th Subida al Naranco 7th Overall Vuelta a Asturias 2007 1st Overall Escalada a Montjuïc 1st Stages 1a & 1b (ITT) 1st Stage 5 Tour de San Luis 1st Stage 4 Vuelta a Chihuahua 2nd Overall Clásica Internacional de Alcobendas 3rd Clásica a los Puertos de Guadarrama 4th Overall Vuelta a Burgos 5th Subida a Urkiola 7th Overall Vuelta por un Chile Líder 7th Gran Premio de Llodio 9th Circuito de Getxo 2008 6th Overall Vuelta a La Rioja 9th Overall Euskal Bizikleta 1st Stage 1 9th Overall Vuelta a Burgos 2009 2nd Overall Tour de Pologne 2nd Gran Piemonte 2nd Japan Cup 5th Overall Vuelta a Chihuahua 1st Stage 4 6th Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia 7th Subida al Naranco 10th GP Miguel Induráin 2010 8th Clásica de Almería 10th Brabantse Pijl 2011 1st Gran Piemonte 2nd Overall Vuelta a Burgos 1st Stage 4 2nd Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia 3rd Coppa Sabatini 8th La Flèche Wallonne 9th Overall Vuelta a España 1st Stage 4 9th Trofeo Deià 2012 1st Overall Vuelta a Burgos 1st Points classification 1st Stages 1 & 2 1st GP Miguel Induráin Critérium du Dauphiné 1st Stages 2 & 7 1st Stage 4 Vuelta a Andalucía 5th Overall Vuelta a España 2013 1st La Flèche Wallonne 3rd Overall Critérium du Dauphiné 3rd Milano–Torino 4th Gran Premio Industria e Commercio di Prato 6th Giro di Lombardia 10th Overall Vuelta a España 1st Stages 4 & 9 2014 2nd Overall Vuelta a Burgos 1st Points classification 3rd Milano–Torino 5th Gran Premio Industria e Commercio di Prato 8th Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 9th Amstel Gold Race 9th La Flèche Wallonne 9th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 10th Overall Tour of Oman 2015 1st Prologue (TTT) Tour of Austria 2nd Giro di Lombardia 3rd Overall Vuelta a Burgos 1st Points classification 1st Stage 5 4th Clásica de San Sebastián 5th La Flèche Wallonne 6th Overall Tour de San Luis 6th GP Miguel Induráin 9th Overall Vuelta a España 9th Milano–Torino 10th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 2016 3rd Road race, UEC European Road Championships 3rd Overall Vuelta a Asturias 1st Points classification 1st Stage 3 4th Milano–Torino 8th Overall Vuelta a España 2017 4th Road race, National Road Championships 7th Overall Vuelta a Burgos "Daniel Moreno to EF Education First-Drapac".
