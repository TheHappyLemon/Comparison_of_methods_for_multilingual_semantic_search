55 (fifty-five) is the natural number following 54 and preceding 56. 55 is the fifteenth discrete semiprime, and the second with 5 as the lowest non-unitary factor. Thus, of the form 5 × q with q a higher prime, in this case equal to 11. It contains an aliquot sum of 17; the seventh prime number, within an aliquot sequence of one composite number (55, 17, 1, 0) that is rooted in the 17-aliquot tree. 55 is the tenth Fibonacci number. It is the largest Fibonacci number to also be a triangular number (the tenth as well); it is furthermore the fourth doubly triangular number. 55 is also an early member inside other families of polygonal numbers; it is strictly (when including 0 as the zeroth indexed member) the fifth: heptagonal number, and square pyramidal number (the sum of the squares of the integers from 1 to 5). It is also the fourth centered nonagonal number, and the third centered icosahedral number. In decimal, 55 is a Kaprekar number, whose digit sum is also 10. It is the first number to be a sum of more than one pair of numbers which mirror each other (23 + 32 and 14 + 41). The prime indices in the prime factorization of 55=5×11{\displaystyle 55=5\times 11} are the respectively the third and fifth, where the first two Fermat primes of the form 22n+1{\displaystyle 2^{2^{n}}+1} are 3{\displaystyle 3} and 5{\displaystyle 5} (11 is also the third super-prime). Where 17 — the aliquot part of 55 — is the third Fermat prime, the fifty-fifth prime number 257 is the fourth such prime number. The base-ten digit representation of the latter satisfies a subtractive concatenation of 7−2=5{\displaystyle 7-2=5}, wherein 77 is the fifty-fifth composite number. In decimal representation, the fifth and largest known Fermat prime is 65537, which contains a "55" string inside (and where as a number, 637 is the eleventh non-trivial decagonal number).
