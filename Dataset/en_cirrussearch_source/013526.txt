Jonathan Douglas Quick (born January 21, 1986) is an American professional ice hockey goaltender for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Quick was selected in the third round, 72nd overall, by the Los Angeles Kings at the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. He is the winningest American-born goaltender in the NHL history currently. He has also played for the Vegas Golden Knights. Quick is a two-time Vezina Trophy nominee and William M. Jennings Trophy winner and was a silver medalist with the United States at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Quick is a three-time Stanley Cup champion, having won with the Kings in 2012 and 2014 and the Vegas Golden Knights in 2023. Quick's Conn Smythe Trophy-winning run in the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs has been described as the best statistical playoff run ever. As a youth, Quick played in the 2000 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the New York Rangers minor ice hockey team. He later played for the Mid Fairfield youth hockey association out of Darien Ice Rink. He carried his team to win a national championship and he was single time during his midget major year.[citation needed] His team also featured forwards Sean Backman, John Mori and Augie DiMarzo, Joey Sides, Joe DeBello, Chris Davis and Cam Atkinson, all of whom went on to play professional hockey.[citation needed] Quick played at Hamden High School in Hamden, Connecticut, before transferring to Avon Old Farms, where he was named to the 2002 New Haven Register All-Area Ice Hockey Team. Quick's number 32 Kings jersey is displayed in the Lou Astorino Ice Arena of Hamden. He led Avon Old Farms to two-straight New England Prep Championships in his junior and senior seasons. He had nine shutouts during his senior year.[citation needed] Quick played collegiate hockey for the University of Massachusetts Amherst out of Hockey East (HE). As a freshman, he earned his first victory by a score of 4–2 on October 15, 2005, in his first start against Clarkson University. He also appeared in one playoff game as a freshman, which the Minutemen lost 4–1 to Boston University. Quick scored his first goal January 6, 2007, against Merrimack College. In the 4–2 win, the unassisted goal came during a delayed penalty into an empty net at 9:31 of the second period; it was the game-winning goal. While playing for the Minutemen, he led the team to their first-ever NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship appearance. In his first NCAA Tournament game, Quick shut-out Clarkson University, stopping all 33 shots he faced, in a 1–0 overtime victory. He appeared in five playoff games and posted a .944 save percentage.[citation needed] After losing in his first professional start, with the ECHL's Reading Royals, Quick made a statistically unlikely goal during a shutout in his second start, scoring an empty-net goal against the Pensacola Ice Pilots on October 27, 2007, at 19:25 in the third period. Quick began the 2008–09 season with the Los Angeles Kings' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manchester Monarchs, sharing time with Jonathan Bernier. He was called up to the Kings on December 16 after goaltender Erik Ersberg suffered a groin injury. Quick played his first NHL game on December 6, 2007, against the Buffalo Sabres in an 8–2 win. He earned his first career NHL shutout on December 23, 2008, defeating the Columbus Blue Jackets in Columbus. He also received the NHL's Third Star of the Week honor for the week ending December 28. In three games, Quick posted a 2–1–0 record, with both victories coming via shutout, posting a 0.67 goals against average (GAA) and a .958 save percentage. On February 9, 2009, he was awarded the First Star of the Week by the NHL after stopping 95 of 100 shots in a three-game road win streak, which launched the Kings back into the 2009 playoff picture. He finished the season with a 21–18–2 record, with a 2.48 GAA and .914 save percentage. He earned his first career NHL Stanley Cup playoff shutout on April 17, 2011, against the San Jose Sharks, stopping all 34 shots for a 4–0 shutout win.[citation needed] On April 25, 2012, after the end of the 2011–12 regular season, Quick was nominated as a Vezina Trophy finalist, along with Henrik Lundqvist and Pekka Rinne, the former of which ultimately won the award. Quick was also named a 2011–12 NHL second team All-Star. He led the League with ten shutouts (a Kings franchise record), had the NHL's second-lowest GAA (1.95) and posted a 35–21–13 final record. Quick gained much attention during the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, as the eighth-seeded Kings defeated the top-seeded and Presidents' Trophy-winning Vancouver Canucks in five games, followed by the Kings' first-ever four-game playoff series sweep, which came against the second-seeded St. Louis Blues.[citation needed] On May 30, 2012, Quick set a new Stanley Cup playoff record after winning his 11th consecutive road game dating back to the 2011 postseason, surpassing the old mark of ten set by Billy Smith of the New York Islanders, and continued adding to the record. The streak ran from April 16, 2011, at San Jose to June 2, 2012, at New Jersey (12 games). Los Angeles qualified for the Western Conference Final for the second time in its 45-year history, and first time since the 1993 playoffs. The Kings ended their 19-year drought and made it to the Stanley Cup Finals after defeating the third-seeded Phoenix Coyotes in Game 5 of the Western Conference Final. Quick was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy following the Kings' first Stanley Cup victory over the New Jersey Devils, 6–1, taking the series four games to two. Quick posted a 16–4 record with a 1.41 GAA, a .946 save percentage and three shutouts along the way. On June 28, 2012, Quick signed a ten-year contract extension that would last until the end of the 2022–23 season. In November 2012, Quick joined the AHL's Manchester Monarchs to continue rehabilitation from an off-season back surgery. Quick won his second career Stanley Cup on June 13, 2014, after the Kings defeated the New York Rangers. He had two playoff shutouts, including one in Game 3 of the Finals, while also posting a save percentage of .911. Following the 2013–14 season, Quick was awarded the William M. Jennings Trophy, which is presented annually "to the goalkeeper(s) having played a minimum of 25 games for the team with the fewest goals scored against it." Because Ben Scrivens and Martin Jones had not played the required number of games to qualify as co-recipients of the honor, Quick was named the sole winner of the trophy. Over the course of the season, Quick had compiled a 27–17–4 record with a 2.07 GAA, .915 save percentage and six shutouts in 49 appearances. On October 16, 2014, Quick posted 43 saves on all 43 shots he faced in a 1–0 shootout victory over the St. Louis Blues. It was Quick's largest save percentage in a shootout win to date. On October 23, Quick surpassed Rogie Vachon as the Kings' all-time leader in shutouts by earning his 33rd after a 2–0 victory over the Buffalo Sabres. In the 2014–15 season Quick would go on to play 72 games, starting 71 of them. Quick would finish with a record of 36–22–13, with a GAA of 2.24 and a Save Percentage of .918 and 6 shutouts. The Kings would go on to miss the playoffs, losing the last playoff spot to the Calgary Flames by 2 points. Quick was in goal as the Kings shut out the Chicago Blackhawks on March 14, 2016, winning 5–0, making Quick the all-time leader in shutouts of American-born goaltenders. On April 27, 2016, Jonathan was nominated for the Vezina Trophy, awarded to the league's best goaltender, for the second time. During the 2016–17 season, Quick suffered a lower-body injury in the season's first game on October 12, 2016, against the San Jose Sharks. He chose to not undergo surgery. Quick was out for four and a half months (59 games in all) and returned with the team on February 25, 2017, in a 4–1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks. Quick was invited to the 2018 NHL All-Star Game, but declined the invitation due to a nagging injury. Per NHL policy, any player who declines an All-Star invitation is required to sit out the next regular season game, leading Quick to miss the Kings' first game back, which took place on January 30, 2018. At the conclusion of the regular season, Quick was awarded his second Jennings Trophy, for allowing the fewest goals against all season. Quick helped the Kings qualify for the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs, where they were swept by the Vegas Golden Knights, as Vegas went on their unlikely Finals run. Quick was impressive, however, allowing only seven goals over the four games, posting a 1.55 GAA and a .947 SV %. On May 8, 2022, Quick recorded his tenth career playoff shutout in 4–0 victory over the Edmonton Oilers in the first round of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs, surpassing Mike Richter for first place among American goaltenders in that category. Midway through the 2022–23 season, Quick's performance was in question. With Pheonix Copley taking over starting duties by the new year, a trade seemed inevitable. Quick started his last game as a King on February 26, 2023, a 5–2 loss against the New York Rangers. On March 1, 2023, Quick was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets along with a conditional first-round pick in 2023 and third-round pick in 2024 in exchange for Vladislav Gavrikov and Joonas Korpisalo. One day later, however, Columbus traded Quick to the Vegas Golden Knights in exchange for Michael Hutchinson and a seventh-round pick in 2025. The Golden Knights sought to acquire Quick due to a rash of injuries to other goaltenders in the organization, including the season's original starter Logan Thompson and regular backup Laurent Brossoit. Quick made his first start for Vegas, and his first non-Kings NHL start, on March 5, 2023, stopping 25 of 28 shots in a 4–3 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. He won his 375th NHL game on March 21, surpassing John Vanbiesbrouck for the second-most wins by an American goaltender in league history, behind only Ryan Miller. Quick won five of his first six games in net with the team, and finished the regular season with a 5–2–2 record and .901 save percentage with the Golden Knights. Vegas finished first in the Western Conference and qualified to the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs, but with Brossoit returning and Adin Hill serving as backup, Quick initially watched from the press box. However, following Brossoit's injury midway through the second round series against the Edmonton Oilers, Quick dressed as backup goaltender behind Hill. He remained in this position through the Golden Knights' deep run to the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals against the Florida Panthers. While not taking the ice, coach Bruce Cassidy praised him for his work ethic and supportive role to the team. The Golden Knights defeated the Panthers in five games, and Quick hoisted the Stanley Cup for the third time, receiving it from former Kings teammate Alec Martinez. Having concluded his contract with the Golden Knights, Quick signed as a free agent to a one-year, $925,000 contract with the New York Rangers for the 2023–24 season on July 1, 2023. Quick admitted that until the Kings traded him away, he thought he "was going to be retiring a King". Having lost the opportunity to spend his entire career with the Los Angeles Kings, and finding out that he enjoyed his backup role while with Vegas, he decided to take the opportunity to sign with the Rangers, the team he had grown up watching as a child in Connecticut and gone on to defeat in the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, to serve as the backup to New York's starter, Igor Shesterkin. Quick started his first game with the Rangers on October 21, a 4–1 win over the Seattle Kraken. On November 22, Quick recorded his 60th NHL career shutout in a 1–0 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins. On March 3, 2024, he was signed to a one-year contract extension by the Rangers. On March 30, during a game against the Arizona Coyotes, Quick earned his 392nd career win and became the all-time leader in wins among American-born goaltenders. On January 1, 2010, Quick was named to the United States national team for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver as the team's third goaltender. He received a silver medal after the U.S. lost to Canada 3–2 in the gold medal game. After his selection to United States national team for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, head coach Dan Bylsma named Quick the team's starting goaltender over teammates Ryan Miller and Jimmy Howard. He would go on to start five out of the U.S.'s six games (Miller would start the other). The United States team did not medal. Quick finished the tournament with a 3–2 record, a 2.17 GAA and a .923 save percentage. Quick is married to Jaclyn (née Backman); they have a daughter and a son together. Jaclyn's sister Alicia is married to former NHL forward Matt Moulson. Quick was born in Milford, Connecticut, and raised in nearby Hamden. He attended Hamden High School until transferring to Avon Old Farms, a preparatory school known for its hockey program. His family still resides in Hamden today. Ray and Mike's Deli in Hamden named the "Quickwich" sandwich in Quick's honor after his 2012 Stanley Cup victory.
