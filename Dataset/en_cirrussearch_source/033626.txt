Toshiya Fujita (藤田 俊哉, Fujita Toshiya, born October 4, 1971) is a Japanese former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Fujita played for Júbilo Iwata, Utrecht, Nagoya Grampus, Roasso Kumamoto and JEF United Chiba. He won five major titles during his time at Júbilo. He also gained 24 caps for the Japan national team between 1995 and 2005. From 2017 to 2018, he held the position of Head of Football Development (Asia) for English club Leeds United. Fujita attended and played football at Shimizu Commercial High School and University of Tsukuba before joining Júbilo Iwata in 1994. Playing as a creative midfielder, Fujita has played an integral role in helping to build Júbilo Iwata into one of the most successful franchises in the J1 League. Although Fujita is not as well known as some of his more illustrious teammates, this probably has more to do with his low-key manner and quiet efficiency rather than a lack of skills. As part of the Júbilo midfield, Fujita had an essential role in providing the transition from defense to attack. In 1999, his contributions to his team were recognized as he was made team captain and won the league MVP award. Fujita joined FC Utrecht, a team of the Eredivisie, on loan in mid-2003. The team was unable to match the performances of the top-tier teams in the Netherlands. As a result, FC Utrecht were unwilling to pay the transfer fee required to keep Fujita and he returned to Japan to once again play for Júbilo Iwata at the end of 2003. From 2004, Fujita played for Júbilo Iwata again. However, his opportunity to play decreased in 2005, he moved to Nagoya Grampus Eight (later Nagoya Grampus) in June 2005. His opportunity to play decreased in 2008 and he left the club end of the season. From 2009, he played for J2 League club Roasso Kumamoto (2009–10) and JEF United Chiba (2011). He announced his retirement in June 2012. On February 15, 1995, Fujita debuted for the Japan national team against Australia. In June 1999, he was selected by Japan for the first time in four years by manager Philippe Troussier. He played at 1999 Copa America. In 2001, he was selected by Japan for the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup. He did not play in the match while Japan came second place. In October 2003, he was selected Japan for the first time in four years by manager Zico. In 2004, he played in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification. He was also selected by Japan for the 2004 Asian Cup. While he did not play in the match, Japan won the title twice in a row. He played 24 games and scored 3 goals for Japan until 2005. Fujita had been managing the Japan Pro-Footballers Association (JPFA, ja) as a chairman for five years with Tetsuro Kiyooka, FIFA players' agent as a chief operating officer and formed the organization as a trade union in 2011 as well as represented the all Japanese footballers and the Japan national football team to protect their rights and status. In 2014 joined Dutch side VVV-Venlo as part of the coaching staff.
