In April Janums receives an order to form a battle group from units of his regiment and send it to Berlin. Battle group (Kampfgruppe Janums) was formed but instead of sending it to Berlin where it most likely would perish in the senseless battles, Janums disobeyed orders and led his group (more than 700 men) to the west. They bypassed Berlin from the south and safely reached the allied lines on 26 April near Lindau. After communication with Americans Janums and his whole battle group on the next day crossed the front line near Gutergluck village and surrendered to the American army. From May 1945 Janums was in allied captivity. He was released in 1946. Janums actively participated in the exile Latvian community. In 1946 he was one of the founders of the Daugavas Vanagi (Hawks of Daugava) Latvian military veteran organization and its first president. The rest of his life was spent in West Germany. He died in Munster 6 August 1981. In 2007 his remains were reburied in Brothers Cemetery, Riga. “Latviešu karavīrs otra pasaules kara laikā”, Stockholm, 1978 “Latvijas armijas augstākie virsnieki”, Rīga, 1998
