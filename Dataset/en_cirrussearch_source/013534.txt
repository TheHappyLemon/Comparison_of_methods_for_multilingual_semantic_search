Lübz (German pronunciation: [lʏpt͜s]) is a town in the Ludwigslust-Parchim district, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, in north-eastern Germany. It is situated on the river Elde, 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) northeast of Parchim. The first mention of Lubicz comes from 1224. The name is of Lechitic origin. It was granted town rights after 1456. During World War II, in February 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Allied prisoners-of-war from the Stalag XX-B POW camp passed through the town. The former municipality Gischow was merged into Lübz in May 2019. It is home to the Mecklenburgische Brauerei Lübz, the largest local employer and one of the larger regional breweries.
