South Park is an American animated television sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for Comedy Central. Parker and Stone developed the series from two animated shorts both titled The Spirit of Christmas (1992, 1995), and was originally developed for Fox. The series was later acquired by Comedy Central, which premiered South Park on August 13, 1997. Produced for an adult audience, South Park became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics. The series revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their adventures in and around the eponymous Colorado town. South Park has received multiple accolades, including three Annie Award nominations (with one win), two Critics' Choice Television Award nominations (with no wins), 17 Emmy Award nominations (with five wins), 3 TCA Awards nominations, and a Peabody Award. The first twenty-five seasons have been released on DVD and Blu-ray, in addition to several compilation releases. On August 5, 2021, Comedy Central announced that Parker and Stone signed a $900 million deal for extending the series to 30 seasons through 2027. The deal also included a series of 14 films for Paramount+, which are released twice per year. Parker and Stone later denied that the projects were films, and clarified that it was ViacomCBS (currently Paramount Global) which decided to advertise them as such. Paramount+ advertises the projects as "exclusive events", and they are generally accepted to be television specials. As of December 20, 2023,[update] 327 episodes of South Park have aired, including six specials, concluding the twenty-sixth season.
