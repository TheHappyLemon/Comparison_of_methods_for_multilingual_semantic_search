The men's basketball tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, began on 6 August and ended on 21 August. The gold medal game in this discipline was the final competitive event before the Closing Ceremony. The United States won their fifteenth gold medal, after defeating Serbia, 96–66, in the gold medal match, which was the largest margin of victory in a gold medal game since the 1992 Summer Olympics. Spain won the bronze medal, after an 89–88 win over Australia. The medals were presented by Patrick Baumann of Switzerland, Dr. René Fasel of Switzerland, Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe, and members of the International Olympic Committee, while the gifts were presented by Horacio Muratore, the President of FIBA, Hamine Niang, the first vice-president of FIBA, and Jerry Colangelo, the chairman of USA Basketball. Each NOC was limited to one team per tournament. Each team had a roster of twelve players, one of which could be a naturalized player. The following referees were selected for the tournament.

As the three winners of the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournaments for Men (OQT) were yet to be known, they were assigned placeholders as "OQT 1", "OQT 2" and "OQT 3". These were the pot assignments: Group A was assigned with OQT 1 and OQT 2, while Group B had OQT 3. After the World Olympic Qualifying Tournament on 10 July 2016, another draw was held at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay, Philippines, to determine which among the teams would be assigned to which group. This was a straight draw: there were two pots containing three balls each. One pot had the names of the teams that won the Olympic Qualifying Tournaments (OQT), while the other pot had the name of the placeholders. All times are local (UTC−3).
