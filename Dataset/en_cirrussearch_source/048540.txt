FK Rabotnichki (Macedonian: ФК Работнички) or more commonly Rabotnički (old transliteration) and Rabotnicki is a football club that plays at the Toshe Proeski Arena in Skopje, North Macedonia. They currently compete in the Macedonian First League. FK Rabotnichki was founded in 1937 as SK Radnički Skoplje. It is widely regarded as the ‘railway football club’. It started competing in the 1938–39 Second League of the Skoplje Football Subassociation which finished 4th out of 5 teams. However the next season Radnički won the league with no defeats among 6 teams and with a goal difference of 45–6, thus earning promotion to the First League of the Skoplje Football Subassociation. However the 1940–41 season of the First League of the Skoplje Football Subassociation was interrupted by the start of the Second World War. By the time Rabotnički had one win, two draws and one defeat. After the end of the war, for a long time, Rabotnichki competed in the Federal Second League or the Macedonian Republic League. They also competed in the First Federal League of SFR Yugoslavia for two years. Since the Republic of Macedonia became an independent country, Rabotnichki constantly competes in the Macedonian First League. In all these years since its establishing in 1937, Rabotnichki has always been among the best clubs, and has always been a good representative of Macedonian football in Europe. The club's most successful years were those between 2001 and 2008 when the club was acquired by the famous company Kometal. Since it was acquired by Kometal, Rabotnichki showed constant progress: in 2002–03 they finished second in the national league and competed in the UEFA Cup, (2004–05) they won the national championship and competed in the qualifications for the UEFA Champions League, and in (2007–08) they had their best year by winning the double crown. Kometal and Trifun Kostovski left Rabotnichki and took over Vardar in 2008. The following year they won the Macedonian Cup for the second time in club history.

In July 2011, they were named the best club in the World for that month by the IFFHS. The winning streak of five games in the Europa League, from which four were in July, plus a win against Bregalnica in the first round of the domestic league were more than enough for the International Federation of Football History & Statistics to name Rabotnički as the "Best club in the World for July 2011".
