She also swam the backstroke leg of the 4×100 metre medley relay in the preliminaries, in which the Swedish team qualified in seventh place for the finals, though the team went on to be disqualified in the final for a false start. The day of the 4×100 metre medley relay final coincided with Sjöström's 15th birthday. On 26 July 2009, at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, Sjöström set a world record in the semifinals of the 100 metre butterfly with a time of 56.44 seconds, surpassing Inge de Bruijn's nine-year-old record.

At the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, China, Sjöström competed in five events, first placing fourth in the 100 metre butterfly with a time of 57.38 seconds, which was 0.32 seconds behind bronze medalist Lu Ying of China.

Later in the day, she finished outside the podium in her third and final individual event, this time tying Lu Ying for fourth-place in the final of the 50 metre butterfly with a 25.87. For Sjöström, 2012 was a year of both successes and setbacks. At the 2012 European Aquatics Championships, held in early summer in Debrecen, Hungary, she achieved double gold medals in her individual events, with one in the 50 metre butterfly and one in the 100 metre freestyle. In her relay event, the 4×100 metre freestyle relay, she helped win the silver medal in a final time of 3:38.40, swimming the third leg of the relay in 54.04 seconds. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Sjöström competed in four individual events, reaching the semi-finals of the 50 metre freestyle, 100 metre freestyle and 200 metre freestyle, and placing fourth in the final of the 100 metre butterfly with a time of 57.17 seconds. Sjöström's world record was broken in this race by Dana Vollmer of the United States. In 2015, Sjöström regained the world record by improving it twice at the World Championships, held in Kazan, Russia. On 29 July 2013, Sjöström won the gold medal in the 100 metre butterfly at the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, in Barcelona, Spain, with a time of 56.53 seconds, which was 0.44 seconds faster than silver medalist Alicia Coutts of Australia and 0.71 seconds faster than bronze medalist Dana Vollmer. Four days later, she won a silver medal in the 100 metre freestyle, finishing 0.55 seconds behind a first-time world champion in the event, Cate Campbell of Australia, with a time of 52.89 seconds. At the 2013 European Short Course Swimming Championships in December in Herning, Denmark, Sjöström won four medals in individual events, a gold medal in the 50 metre butterfly with a Championships record of 24.90 seconds, a gold medal in the 100 metre butterfly, a silver medal in the 50 metre freestyle, and a silver medal in the 100 metre freestyle, and two medals in relay events, one silver medal each in the 4×50 metre freestyle relay and 4×50 metre medley relay. On 5 July 2014, Sjöström broke the world record in the long course 50 metre butterfly, set at 25.07 by fellow Swedish swimmer Therese Alshammar in 2009, with a time of 24.43 seconds. The margin of 0.64 seconds by which she lowered the world record compared to the prior record has been juxtaposed with Bob Beamon's 1968 long jump world record. At the 2014 European Aquatics Championships, held in Berlin, Germany later that summer, she won three gold medals and four silver medals.

For her second event of the session, she helped qualify the 4×100 metre mixed freestyle relay to the final ranking sixth, splitting a 54.28 for the fourth leg of the relay. With a 24.27 in the semifinals of the 50 metre freestyle, she qualified for the final ranking first, 0.09 seconds ahead of Katarzyna Wasick of Poland. Finishing off the day, she won bronze medal in the 4×100 metre mixed freestyle relay, splitting a 52.68 for the third leg of the relay to contribute to the final time, and Swedish record, of 3:23.40. The bronze medal marked her 26th medal at LEN European Aquatics Championships and set a new record for the most number of medals won at the Championships by a female swimmer from any country. She further increased the record to a total of 27 medals the following day when she won the gold medal in the 50 metre freestyle with a time of 23.91 seconds, this also marked a new overall record by a swimmer from any country, male or female. The previous record was set by male swimmer Alexander Popov of Russia at 26 medals. The seventh and final morning, Sjöström split a 54.01 for the freestyle leg of the 4×100 metre medley relay, helping qualify for the final ranking first in 3:59.19. In the final, she lowered her split time to a 52.04, helping win the gold medal in a time of 3:55.25, which marked her 17th gold medal at LEN Aquatics Championships and extended the all-time total medal record to 28 medals. At the 2023 Stockholm Swim Open in April, Sjöström won the long course 50 metre freestyle with the fastest time in the world for the 2023 year by a female at that point in the time, a 2023 World Aquatics Championships qualifying time of 23.92 seconds. At the 2023 World Aquatics Championships, Sjöström won the long course 50 metre freestyle, breaking her own world record in the semifinal. In doing so, she set the record for the longest period of time in between world-record setting performances by an individual swimmer, 14 years and 3 days after first breaking the 100 metre butterfly world record in 2009. She also won the 50 metre butterfly for the fifth time in a row at the World Aquatic Championships. These two medals led her to tie and then overtake Michael Phelps as the swimmer with the most individual World Aquatic Championship medals at 21 in her career. She additionally performed on Sweden's 400 metre freestyle and 400 metre medley relays; notably, her lead-off split of 52.24 in finals for the freestyle relay would have earned her a silver medal in the 100 metre freestyle.
