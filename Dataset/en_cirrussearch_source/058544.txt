Klim Alekseevich Shipenko (Russian: Клим Алексеевич Шипенко; born 16 June 1983) is a Russian film director, screenwriter, cinematographer, actor, producer and cosmonaut. Shipenko was born in Moscow, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union (now Russia). In 2002 he entered the California State University at Northridge (Film Production Department). He worked as an intern on the set of the film Something's Gotta Give by Nancy Meyers. Filmed the diploma film as a cameraman. Studied at the Sal Dano Professional Actors Workshop. In 2004 he returned to Moscow. For a short time he worked on Channel One, was the director of the Plantain program about cars. In 2021, Shipenko shot portions of a science fiction film aboard the International Space Station. It is to be the second narrative feature-length fiction film shot (partially) in space (after Return from Orbit), and it is the first feature-length fiction film to be filmed in space by professional film-makers. The project is tentatively called The Challenge (2023 film), and was shot between the launch of Soyuz MS-19 and return of Soyuz MS-18. The first narrative film filmed fully (the narrative film Return from Orbit had some scenes filmed in space) in outer space was a short film titled Apogee of Fear, shot in 2008. The Challenge was in a race with Tom Cruise and Doug Liman to shoot the first narrative feature film in space. On the ISS Shipenko was in charge of camera, lighting, sound recording and makeup. The acting was done by actress Yulia Peresild. The filming equipment was launched at Progress MS-17 and returned on Soyuz MS-18. Pyotr Dubrov and Mark Vande Hei helped with filming. 2018 - The 16th Golden Eagle Award ceremony for the best feature film Salyut 7. 2020 - The 18th Golden Eagle Award ceremony for the best feature film Text. 2023 - State Prize of the Russian Federation in the field of literature and art in 2022 (June 9, 2023) - for the creation of the feature film The Challenge.

In the film Return from Orbit the scenes filmed in space included important characters (not just "background"); the characters were portrayed by cosmonauts, not the "usual" professional actors portraying those characters, in the scenes that were filmed in actual space. As Return from Orbit was also filmed by movie professionals (except those scenes filmed in space, which were filmed by cosmonauts) and released into cinemas for wide audience, it has a good claim to the title "first movie in space"; the only relevant difference with The Challenge (2023) is that in the case of Return from Orbit, all professional film-makers stayed on the ground, whereas in the case of The Challenge, some professional film-makers flew to ISS to film some scenes for the movie. Also full feature length documentary films that have been released to movie theaters, like For All Mankind (1989) or A Beautiful Planet (2016; a film long enough to be a feature film according to many but not all definitions of feature film) have been filmed in space. The Challenge is however the first time a professional actor/ess has been filmed in space by a professional director, as other films before were filmed and acted in by astronauts/cosmonauts/space tourists (space tourists that were amateur both in film-making and as astronauts) or used footage from automated equipment. Apogee of Fear was written by a professional scriptwriter, and with some graphics assets done by a professional, but had no other filming professionals involved. "Клим Шипенко.
