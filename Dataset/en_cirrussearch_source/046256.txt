Those are played on consecutive days with a rest day between the semi-final tie-breaks and match 1. Eventual tie-breaks are scheduled for 23 November, in the same manner as the whole tournament (two rapid games of 25+10, i.e. 25 minutes for the whole game plus a 10-second increment, the two rapid games of 10+10, two blitz games of 5+3 and an armageddon decider). Top seed Ju Wenjun, the reigning women's world champion and current women's rapid world champion, advanced to the final without playing a tie-break. Her opponent Kateryna Lagno played three tie-breaks including one armageddon game against Natalia Pogonina in the third round. Before the final, both had played each other five times at classical time control with all games ending in a draw. Player positions were determined by the October FIDE rating list. No. 1 plays no. 64, 2 plays 63, and so on. AM. "Ju Wenjun defends Women's World Champion's title". www.fide.com. Archived from the original on 8 December 2018. Retrieved 24 November 2018.
