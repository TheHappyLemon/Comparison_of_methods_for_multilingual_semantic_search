American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails have released 11 studio albums, one live album, three remix albums, two compilation albums, six extended plays, 20 singles, 10 promotional singles, four video albums and 31 music videos. Nine Inch Nails has also contributed to numerous film soundtracks as well as the soundtrack to the video game Quake. Initial ambitions for Nine Inch Nails in 1988 were to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. With the addition of future singles "Head Like a Hole" and "Sin", many of these demo tracks would later appear in revised form on the band's debut studio album, Pretty Hate Machine. The album was released in October 1989 and peaked at number 75 on the Billboard 200 the following year. In response to pressures from TVT Records for a follow-up to Nine Inch Nails' commercially successful debut, Reznor began recording the Broken extended play in secret. The EP was released in September 1992 and reached number seven on the Billboard 200. Nine Inch Nails' second studio album, The Downward Spiral (1994), reached number two on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 3.7 million copies in the United States, remaining the band's highest-selling release in the US. Five years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' next major album, The Fragile, a double album that debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 228,000 copies in its first week, but dropped from the top 10 afterward. Another six years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' next studio album, With Teeth, which also debuted atop the Billboard 200. In 2007, the band released their fifth studio album, Year Zero, alongside an accompanying alternate reality game. Reznor announced in late 2007 that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual obligations with Interscope Records, and would distribute its next major album independently. The band's final Interscope release was a remix album based on material from Year Zero. The first Nine Inch Nails album released independently was the instrumental Ghosts I–IV in March 2008, followed two months later by The Slip. Hesitation Marks, the band's eighth studio album, was released in August 2013 through Columbia Records, reaching number three on the Billboard 200. After teasing a release in early 2016, Nine Inch Nails began releasing a trilogy of new releases: the EPs Not the Actual Events in December 2016 and Add Violence in July 2017, followed by the band's ninth studio album, Bad Witch, in June 2018. On March 26, 2020, the band released the albums Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts as a show of solidarity with their fans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Quake, June 22, 1996 Each official Nine Inch Nails release is chronologically ordered with a sequential number prefixed by the word "Halo."[citation needed] These numbers are sometimes modified for alternate versions of a release, such as the multiple releases of The Downward Spiral. Promotional-only releases do not have their own numbers, although the promotional singles for "Piggy" and "Hurt" were both labeled as "Halo Ten," a title later officially used for Further Down the Spiral. A US promo for "Into the Void" is mislabeled as Halo 16 because this number actually belongs to the Things Falling Apart remix album. Broken, the unreleased short film directed by Peter Christopherson, contains the videos for "Pinion", "Wish", and "Happiness in Slavery" as well as a video for "Help Me I am in Hell" and a different video for "Gave Up" from the one on Closure. The short film contains graphic depictions of a seemingly helpless victim being tortured and forced to watch Nine Inch Nails videos. List of songs recorded by Nine Inch Nails The Fragile is considered double platinum since it is a double album with length exceeding 100 minutes. Ghosts V: Together did not enter the Billboard 200, but peaked at number 64 on the Album Sales chart and number 51 on the Current Album Sales chart. Ghosts VI: Locusts did not enter the Billboard 200, but peaked at number 78 on the Album Sales chart and number 60 on the Current Album Sales chart. Two versions of And All That Could Have Been were released, a limited edition and a general release, and each charted separately on the Billboard 200: the limited edition peaked at number 26, and the general release at number 37. Not the Actual Events did not enter the NZ Top 40 Albums Chart, but peaked at number one on the NZ Heatseekers Albums Chart. Fixed did not enter the Billboard Hot 100, but peaked at number 35 on the Hot Singles Sales chart. "Head Like a Hole" was re-released in Australia in 1995, peaking at number 57 on the Australian chart. "Head Like a Hole" did not enter the Billboard Hot 100, but peaked at number nine on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. "Discipline" was released to radio stations and as a free download on the official Nine Inch Nails site. "Echoplex", was released as a free download from iLike. "Came Back Haunted" did not enter the Billboard Hot 100, but peaked at number nine on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. "Less Than" did not enter the Canadian Hot 100, but peaked at number 47 on the Hot Canadian Digital Song Sales chart. "Isn't Everyone" did not enter the Alternative Songs chart, but peaked at number 14 on the Alternative Digital Song Sales chart. Soeder, John (April 9, 2000).
