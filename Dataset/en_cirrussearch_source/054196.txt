Marc Hirschi (born 24 August 1998) is a Swiss cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam UAE Team Emirates. In September 2018 it was announced that he would join Team Sunweb from 2019 on a three-year contract, having been a member of Development Team Sunweb in 2018. In the same month, Hirschi won the under-23 road race at the UCI Road World Championships in Innsbruck, Austria. In August 2020, he was named in the startlist for the 2020 Tour de France, during which he won a stage, three combative rider awards for his performances on individual stages and the overall Combativity award. One week after the end of the Tour, he took the bronze medal in the Men's road race at the Road World Championships in Imola. Three days later Hirschi took the win at La Flèche Wallonne, pulling away from the rest of the lead group in the last 50 metres of the final climb of the Mur de Huy. He was the first Swiss rider to win the race since Ferdinand Kübler in 1952. In January 2021, Hirschi's contract with Team DSM was terminated by mutual consent, and he signed a three-year contract with UAE Team Emirates. 2014 3rd Road race, National Junior Championships 2015 National Junior Championships 1st Road race 3rd Time trial 1st Overall Grand Prix Rüebliland 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 1 1st Overall GP Général Patton 5th Trofeo Emilio Paganessi UEC European Junior Championships 5th Road race 7th Time trial 8th Overall Oberösterreich Juniorenrundfahrt 9th Road race, UCI World Junior Championships 2016 1st Road race, National Junior Championships 1st Overall Tour du Pays de Vaud 1st Trofeo Emilio Paganessi 2nd Time trial, UEC European Junior Championships 3rd Overall Grand Prix Rüebliland 1st Stage 3 3rd Overall GP Général Patton 1st Points classification 3rd Gent–Wevelgem Juniors 5th Trofeo Buffoni 6th Paris–Roubaix Juniors 8th Time trial, UCI World Junior Championships 2017 1st Time trial, National Under-23 Championships 1st Tour du Jura 1st Mountains classification, Le Triptyque des Monts et Chateaux UEC European Under-23 Championships 3rd Road race 8th Time trial 6th Piccolo Giro di Lombardia 7th Ronde van Vlaanderen Beloften 2018 1st Road race, UCI World Under-23 Championships UEC European Under-23 Championships 1st Road race 5th Time trial 2nd Overall Tour Alsace 1st Stage 3 3rd Overall Grand Prix Priessnitz spa 1st Stage 2 National Under-23 Championships 3rd Road race 4th Time trial 4th Overall Tour de l'Ain 1st Young rider classification 5th Overall Istrian Spring Trophy 1st Stage 2 5th Liège–Bastogne–Liège Espoirs 5th Eschborn–Frankfurt Under-23 6th Ronde van Vlaanderen Beloften 8th Coppa Ugo Agostoni 10th Overall Tour de Savoie Mont Blanc 10th Tour du Doubs 10th Tacx Pro Classic 2019 National Championships 2nd Time trial 4th Road race 3rd Clásica de San Sebastián 5th Overall BinckBank Tour 6th Overall Deutschland Tour 1st Young rider classification 10th E3 Binckbank Classic 2020 (2 pro wins) 1st La Flèche Wallonne Tour de France 1st Stage 12 Held after Stages 2–3 Combativity award Stages 9, 12, 18 & Overall 2nd Liège–Bastogne–Liège 3rd Road race, UCI World Championships 2021 (1) 2nd Time trial, National Championships 2nd Overall Tour de Luxembourg 1st Stage 2 2nd Veneto Classic 5th Brussels Cycling Classic 6th Road race, UEC European Championships 6th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 10th Druivenkoers Overijse 2022 (4) 1st Giro della Toscana 1st Grand Prix of Aargau Canton 1st Per sempre Alfredo 1st Veneto Classic 3rd Overall Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 8th GP Miguel Induráin 9th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 9th Amstel Gold Race 9th GP Industria & Artigianato 9th Coppa Sabatini 2023 (7) 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st Overall Tour de Hongrie 1st Stage 3 1st Overall Tour de Luxembourg 1st Young rider classification 1st Coppa Sabatini 1st Giro dell'Appennino 1st Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia 2nd Gran Piemonte 2nd Veneto Classic 2nd Grosser Preis des Kantons Aargau 2nd Memorial Marco Pantani 2nd Coppa Agostoni 4th Eschborn–Frankfurt 4th Coppa Bernocchi 4th Clásica Jaén Paraíso Interior 5th Giro del Veneto 5th Trofeo Matteotti 6th Overall Renewi Tour 6th Bretagne Classic 8th Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race 8th Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec 10th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 10th Hamburg Cyclassics 10th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal 2024 (1) 1st La Drôme Classic 3rd Milano–Torino 6th Figueira Champions Classic 2016 1st Madison, UCI World Junior Championships (with Reto Müller) 1st Madison, National Championships (with Reto Müller) 2017 3rd Team pursuit, National Championships "Team Sunweb".
