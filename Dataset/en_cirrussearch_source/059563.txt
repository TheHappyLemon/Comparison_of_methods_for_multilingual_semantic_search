Real Betis Baloncesto S.A.D., simply known as Real Betis, is a professional basketball team based in Seville, Spain. The team plays in the LEB Oro, the second basketball division of the Spanish basketball league system after the Liga ACB. It plays its home games at San Pablo. Club Deportivo de Baloncesto Sevilla was founded in 1987 when the team bought the seat of Dribling de Madrid in the second division, in that time called Primera División B. In 1989, the team promoted to Liga ACB for the first time ever. In 1996 and 1999 the club finished the league as runner-up being defeated both times in the finals 0–3 by FC Barcelona. In 2011, Sevilla lost the 2010–11 Eurocup final, played in Treviso, Italy, against Unics Kazan. On 21 July 2016, Baloncesto Sevilla and Real Betis agreed a collaboration agreement for helping the football squad to solve the financial problems of the basketball team. The team would be called Real Betis Energía Plus as a result of the agreement and a new sponsor. On 31 December 2016, Real Betis agreed the buy of the 99.99% of the shares of the club and implemented it on 12 January 2017. In 2017 the club relegated from Liga ACB for the first time in its history, but remained in the league in application of the precautionary measures issued by the judicial demand of the Andalusian club after the change of the requirements to join the ACB during the pre-season. However, the club was relegated again in the next season after a very poor performance with only seven wins in 34 matches, finishing in the last position of the league table. On 6 September 2018, the club unanimously approved to take the necessary steps to obtain the pertinent authorization from the Spanish royal house to change its name to Real Betis Baloncesto S.A.D. This change was finally approved on 15 December 2018. During the 2018–19 season, their first ever in LEB Oro, Real Betis beat the record of biggest winning streak with 17, thus meaning they beat all their league opponents consecutively. The club quickly came back to the top tier after winning the championship with four rounds left. From 1987 to 2014, the club was sponsored by Caja San Fernando, renamed in 2007 as Cajasol and merged in Banca Cívica years later.
