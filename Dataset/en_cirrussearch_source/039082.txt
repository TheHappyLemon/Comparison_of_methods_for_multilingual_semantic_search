Estadio Azteca (Latin American Spanish: [esˈtaðjo asˈteka]) is a football stadium located in Mexico City. It is the official home of football team Club América, as well as the Mexico national team. The stadium sits at an altitude of 2,200 m (7,200 feet) above sea level. With a capacity of 87,523, it is the largest stadium in Latin America and the eighth-largest association football stadium in the world. Regarded as one of the most famous and iconic football stadiums in the world, it is the first to have hosted two FIFA World Cup finals; the 1970 World Cup Final, where Brazil defeated Italy 4–1, and the 1986 World Cup Final, where Argentina defeated West Germany 3–2. It also hosted the 1986 quarter-final match between Argentina and England in which Diego Maradona scored both the "Hand of God goal" and the "Goal of the Century". The Estadio Azteca is the only football stadium in the world to have both Pelé (1970) and Diego Maradona (1986) win the FIFA World Cup, both of whom are considered among the greatest football players of all time. The stadium also hosted the "Game of the Century", when Italy defeated West Germany 4–3 in extra time in one of the 1970 semifinal matches. The stadium was also the principal venue for the football tournament of the 1968 Summer Olympics and the 1971 Women's World Cup. The stadium is scheduled to host games during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, including the opening game, making it the only stadium to host three editions of the FIFA World Cup. Additionally, the National Football League (NFL) features one game at Estadio Azteca per season as a part of its International Series. The Estadio Azteca was envisioned as a major sports venue during the presidency of Adolfo López Mateos, when Mexico was awarded the 1968 Summer Olympics, where the football final was held. The stadium was designed by architects Pedro Ramírez Vázquez and Rafael Mijares Alcérreca and broke ground in 1961. The inaugural match was between Club América and Torino F.C. on 29 May 1966, with a capacity for 107,494 spectators. The first goal was scored by Brazilian Arlindo Dos Santos and the second one by Brazilian José Alves; later, the Italians tied the game, which ended in 2–2 draw. Mexican president Gustavo Díaz Ordaz made the initial kick and FIFA president Sir Stanley Rous was the witness. A modern illumination system was inaugurated on 5 June 1966, with the first night game played between Spanish side Valencia C.F. and Necaxa. The first goal of the match was scored by Honduran José Cardona for Valencia. Roberto Martínez, aka Caña Brava, became the first Mexican to score a goal in the stadium after scoring for Necaxa. The result was a 3–1 victory for Valencia. In 1978 the stadium hosted the final of the Copa Interamericana between América and Boca Juniors of Argentina, and would host a final again in 1990 between América and Club Olimpia of Paraguay. The Estadio Azteca is also the site in which Pelé and Diego Maradona (during the 1970 and 1986 FIFA World Cup) lifted the trophy for the last time (The Jules Rimet Trophy and the current FIFA World Cup Trophy, respectively). Estadio Azteca has also been used for musical performances throughout its history. Michael Jackson (5 sold-out shows in 1993), Menudo (in 1983), U2 (in 2006 and 2011), Luis Miguel (in 2002), Paul McCartney (in 2012 and 2017), Elton John, Maná, Juan Gabriel, Gloria Estefan, Jaguares, Lenny Kravitz, *Nsync, Hanson, Ana Gabriel, and The Three Tenors all have become part of the stadium's main spectacle. The stadium has also been used for political events, including Mexican president Felipe Calderón's campaign closure in 2006, as well as religious events, such as Jehovah's Witnesses conventions, and the appearance of Pope John Paul II in 1999. In April 2017, it was announced that starting July 2018, Cruz Azul would relocate to the Azteca on a temporary basis, due to the impending demolition of the Estadio Azul. According to club owner Guillermo Álvarez, they plan on building a new private stadium, which could take an estimated three-to-four years. The stadium is scheduled to host games during the 2026 FIFA World Cup that will take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada. It will be the third time Azteca hosts World Cup games as the 1970 and 1986 games took place at the stadium. Additionally, it will host the inaugural game of the 2026 Fifa World Cup. The stadium has undergone gradual improvements and renovations, including the replacing of seating within the stadium as well as the installation of electronic advertising boards. In May 2015, modern Panasonic LED panels were installed at the north and south ends of the stadium, replacing the phosphorous panels installed in 1998. In February 2015, a vast renovation plan was unveiled with the intention that the completion of the project coincide with the stadium's 50th anniversary and with Club América's centenary in 2016, as well as the construction of a commercial hub outside the stadium to be completed some time in 2019. It was reported that Grupo Televisa, owners of the stadium, approved a joint-venture bid from private development firms IQ Real Estate and Alhel. The hub, named "Foro Azteca", would reportedly consist of a mall, office spaces, two hotels, new leisure spaces, and parking spaces for 2,500 cars. The renovations to the stadium were planned in two phases: the first saw the demolition of the restaurant and seating at the lower east stand and the construction of a new hospitality area with dining and banqueting spaces, and the second saw the construction of new media boxes and private skyboxes at the upper west stand. The renovations to the stadium were completed in November 2016. The seating capacity was ultimately reduced to 87,000 as a result of the renovations. The name "Azteca" is a tribute to the Aztec heritage of Mexico City. The stadium is currently owned by Mexican multimedia conglomerate Televisa. In January 1997, Televisa officially changed the stadium's name to Estadio Guillermo Cañedo, in tribute to Guillermo Cañedo de la Bárcena, a top network executive, former Mexican Football Federation president, and a prominent member of the FIFA executive committee who had died earlier that month. After the change proved to be unpopular with the public, Televisa returned to referring to it solely as Estadio Azteca. The stadium is also referred to by the nickname "Coloso de Santa Úrsula" ("Colossus of Santa Ursula"), due to its large structure and Santa Úrsula referring to the suburb where the stadium is located. It is served by the Azteca station on the Xochimilco Light Rail line. This line is an extension of the Mexico City metro system which begins at Metro Tasqueña station and ends in the Xochimilco Light Rail Station. Tickets are available up until kick-off times from the ticket office which is located at the front of the stadium, located towards the exit ramps from the Azteca station. Prices start from as little as MXN$100 (about US$5 as of 2016), and could cost up to MXN$500 (about US$26 as of 2016) for more high-profile matches. A commemorative bronze plaque of the "Game of the Century" played between Italy and West Germany, as well as Diego Maradona's "Goal of the Century" against England. There is also a commemorative plaque with the names of the first goal scorer in the inaugural match and in the first match played at night. Estadio Azteca has hosted the FIFA World Cup on two occasions, hosting a total of nineteen FIFA World Cup matches overall. The stadium hosted ten matches during the 1970 FIFA World Cup including the final. Sixteen years later the stadium hosted nine matches during the 1986 FIFA World Cup, including the final which was the second FIFA World Cup final to be played at the stadium. Estadio Azteca will host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup which will make the stadium the only stadium to have hosted the FIFA World Cup on three occasions. Mexico City was formally announced as a host city for the FIFA World Cup in June 2020 when FIFA announced the host cities for the tournament. Mexico City is one of three host cities in Mexico and is one of sixteen host cities overall for the tournament which is being staged across the United States, Canada and Mexico. In the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the stadium will undergo renovations. However the renovations were scaled down after neighbors near the stadium complained about the project. On 4 February 2024, it was revealed that the stadium would host the opening match of both Mexico and the tournament on 11 June 2026. In total, the stadium will host five matches, three group stage matches, one Round of 32 match, and one Round of 16 match. 1968 Summer Olympics 1971 Women's World Cup 1975 Pan American Games 1977 CONCACAF Championship 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship 1985 Mexico City Cup / Azteca 2000 1993 CONCACAF Gold Cup 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup On 25 April 2022, a fight involving association football fans and the police ensued after a Cruz Azul versus Atlético San Luis game.

On 15 August 1994, Estadio Azteca hosted a preseason American Bowl game between the Houston Oilers and Dallas Cowboys which still holds the record for the highest attendance at any NFL game, with 112,376 in attendance. The Houston Oilers won the game 6–0. On 2 October 2005, the first international regular-season game in the history of the NFL was played in the stadium between the San Francisco 49ers and the Arizona Cardinals. The game was a 31–14 victory for the Cardinals. It set the record of the largest crowd to attend a regular-season NFL game with 103,467, but this record would be broken in 2009. On 21 November 2016, the Oakland Raiders hosted a home game along with the Houston Texans as part of the NFL International Series in the first game dubbed NFL Mexico Game. It was the first Monday Night Football game played outside the United States. The game saw a sell-out crowd of 76,743 in a renovated Estadio Azteca. On 19 November 2017, the Raiders hosted the Patriots at the stadium. The Kansas City Chiefs were scheduled to play the Los Angeles Rams at the stadium on 19 November 2018. However, due to poor field conditions brought on by recent events, as well as rain, the NFL cancelled the event and moved it to the Rams' home stadium Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Kansas City Chiefs played the Los Angeles Chargers on 18 November 2019, with the Chargers designated as the "home" team. In 2015, Nigerian Pastor T.B. Joshua held a two-day Christian crusade, attracting an estimated 150,000 over both days. From 13 to 14 December 2013, assemblies were held by the Jehovah's Witnesses to commemorate their religious devotion with a series of performances in scenes of biblical passages, social-contemporary themes and Christian baptisms, of which each day record of participation of 105,000 faithful, of which on Sunday there was the record time of eviction of 10 minutes for reasons of other scheduled events and in turn 2000 participants were dedicated to cleaning after each event. A public funeral service for popular Mexican comedian Roberto Gomez "Chespirito" Bolaños was held at Azteca on 30 November 2014, and was attended by 40,000 spectators. Chespirito had been a long-time supporter of Club América.
