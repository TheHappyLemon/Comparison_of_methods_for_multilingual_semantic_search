The Government of Latvia is the central government of the Republic of Latvia. The Constitution of Latvia (Latvian: Satversme) outlines the nation as a parliamentary republic represented by a unicameral parliament (Saeima) and the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Republikas Ministru kabinets), which form the executive branch of the Government of Latvia. Since the early 2000s cabinet meetings in Latvia have been open to the public. In June 2013, the Latvian government became one of the first in Europe to offer live internet broadcasts of cabinet meetings. Cabinet of Ministers building (the Palace of Justice) co-located with the Supreme Court. View from Radisson Blu Hotel Latvija.
