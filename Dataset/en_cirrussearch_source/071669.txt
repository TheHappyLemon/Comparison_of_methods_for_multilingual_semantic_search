Johan-Olav Smørdal Botn (born 18 June 1999) is a Norwegian biathlete. He made his Biathlon World Cup debut in 2024. Botn made his international debut relatively late in November 2021, securing the 32nd position in the IBU Cup sprint in Idre. Following another appearance in January, he was subsequently excluded from the squad. During the winter of 2022/23, the Norwegian participated in the initial races in early December, achieving his first top-10 result with an 8th place in the individual competition. Due to Erlend Bjøntegaard's decision to waive his starting rights, Botn received the reserve starting position for the season finale in Canmore and secured podium finishes in both sprint races. His standout performance, however, occurred in the final race of the season, the pursuit competition, where he claimed his first IBU Cup victory with a lead of over a minute over Vebjørn Sørum. At the Norwegian Championships, Botn, alongside Håvard Bogetveit, Simon Kirkeeide, and Johannes Thingnes Bø, won the bronze medal in the relay event for Sogn og Fjordane. For the 2023/2024 season, he was selected for the B-national team for the first time. At the 2024 European Biathlon Championship, he won one gold and two silver medals.
