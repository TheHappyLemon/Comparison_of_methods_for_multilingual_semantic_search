Sporting Clube Olhanense (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈspɔɾtĩɡ ˈkluβɨ oʎɐˈnẽsɨ]) is a Portuguese sports club from Olhão, Algarve. Its football team was founded on 27 April 1912 and currently plays in the Algarve Football Association First Division, the fifth tier of Portuguese football. It holds home matches at the 5,661-spectator capacity Estádio José Arcanjo. Olhanense won the Campeonato de Portugal (now Taça de Portugal) in 1924, their most prestigious honour in history. They most recently played in the Primeira Liga in 2014 and the second tier in 2017. Founded on 27 April 1912, it became the branch number 4 of Sporting Clube de Portugal (Sporting CP). Olhanense's earliest major honour was winning the 1923–24 Campeonato de Portugal (now Taça de Portugal), the largest football cup competition in Portugal. It also became the first team from the Algarve region to reach the top level of Portuguese football, after winning the Algarve Football Association in 1941. Among its achievements was a fourth-place finish in the 1945–46 season. In 1951, after ten consecutive seasons, the club returned to the second division. Following this descent, the team only returned to the top flight for five seasons in the rest of the 20th century – three in the early 1960s and two in the mid-1970s – at time when rivals Farense and Portimonense had their most successful years. Managed by former Portugal international defender Jorge Costa, the team returned to the Primeira Liga as champions of the 2008–09 Liga de Honra by defeating Gondomar 1–0. After five years in the top flight, Olhanense were relegated in May 2014 by finishing last in a season in which they had three managers. The result left the Algarve without a top-flight team. Three years later, the team finished last in the LigaPro, therefore falling out of the professional leagues for the first time in 13 years. For the first half of 2021, former Netherlands international Edgar Davids was the manager. The team missed out on promotion to the new Liga 3 that year, thus falling into the fourth tier. The 2022–23 season ended with relegation to the Algarve FA's First Division, a first such descent. The club has rivalries with fellow Algarve clubs Farense and Portimonense.
