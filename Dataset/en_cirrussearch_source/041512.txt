He played for Forward, Hasle/Løren, Manglerud Star, Storhamar Dragons and Vålerenga. He is the father of players Steffen Thoresen and Patrick Thoresen. In Vålerenga, he reached 367 points in 220 games, which gives him a fourth place on the club's all-time high list. Before the 1992–93 season, he transferred to Storhamar Dragons, where he obtained 155 points in 150 matches. Half-way through the 1995/1996 season, he became a manager for Storhamar Dragons, and led them to the Norwegian title, his first as a coach. In 2000 he signed with Vålerenga, and served as their coach until 2004, when he went back to Storhamar Dragons to help them get stability in a struggling team. In 2009 he signed a 3-year contract with Stavanger Oilers. He left Oilers in 2016 to become the head coach of the Norwegian national team. Today he is the head coach of Storhamar Hockey. He has played 96 matches for the Norwegian national team, which makes him the fifth most featured player on the national team.
