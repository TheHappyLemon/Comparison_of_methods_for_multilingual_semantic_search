Before being elected president of the United States, Donald Trump had produced and hosted reality TV shows The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice from 2004 to 2015. He also made dozens of cameo appearances in films, television series, and advertisements since the 1980s. He has won the Worst Supporting Actor award at the 11th Golden Raspberry Awards for Ghosts Can't Do It in 1990, as well as awards for Worst Actor and Worst screen Combo at the 39th Golden Raspberry Awards for his roles in the documentary films Death of a Nation and Fahrenheit 11/9 in 2019.

In 1989, Trump appeared in the music video for Bobby Brown's single "On Our Own", which was featured in the movie Ghostbusters II. In 1991, Trump originally made an appearance in the music video for Precious Metal's cover of Janet Robin's song, "Mr. Big Stuff". However, Trump wanted a $250,000 payment instead of the agreed-upon $10,000 appearance fee. After the band refused to pay for his appearance, Trump was replaced in the final version of the music video. He also appeared in an I Like Trains song The Truth. Trump has also appeared in a number of television commercials for Pizza Hut. The first of these commercials aired in the United States in 1995, and featured him and his ex-wife Ivana promoting Stuffed Crust pizzas.

Wilson) turns Hill Valley's courthouse into a gaudy casino/hotel (à la the Trump Plaza hotel) where he lives an obnoxiously luxurious lifestyle. In his office is a portrait of himself that was based on one of Donald Trump. Co-writer Bob Gale says that the Trump connection was definitely intentional.
