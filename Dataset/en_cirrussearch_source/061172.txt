Reni (Ukrainian: Рені́, pronounced [reˈn⁽ʲ⁾i]; Romanian: Reni) is a small city in Izmail Raion, Odesa Oblast, southern Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Reni urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Reni is located in the Bessarabian historic district of Budjak and on the left bank of the Danube. The settlement was founded around 1548, acquiring city status in 1821. Population: 17,736 (2022 estimate). There are six schools, one filial branch of the Oles Honchar Dnipro National University, and three Ukrainian Orthodox church buildings. Reni is also home to the Light of the World Church. Until July 18, 2020, Reni was the administrative center of Reni Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Odesa Oblast to seven. The area of Reni Raion was merged into Izmail Raion. On the night between July 23 and 24, 2023, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the nationwide missile attacks, the port of Reni was attacked by Russia, being struck by multiple suicide drones. The port of Reni is an internal port of Ukraine, laying on the Danube river which forms Ukraine's border with Romania, the port itself lying half a kilometer away from the Romanian bank of the Danube. Multiple Romanian sailors in the waters around the port caught the bombings on camera, and a Romanian ship was damaged during the assault. Similar attacks targeted the nearby ports of Izmail and Kiliia, all laying on the Danube. The government of the neighbouring country allowed numerous ships to immediately cross the border. According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, the surrounding Reni Raion includes some 38,000 people (including those in the town), 49% of them ethnic Moldovans/Romanians, 18% Ukrainians, 15% Russians, 8.5% Bulgarians and 8% Gagauz. In 1897, the ethnic make-up, by mother tongue, was 37.6% Moldavian/Romanian, 19.8% Ukrainian, 17.1% Russian, 10.5% Jewish, 9.4% Bulgarian, 2.0% Greek, 1.5% Turkish, 1.1% Polish.
