Following examination of the body, Tang found a needle prick in the victim's body, which was not reported in the autopsy report. Also, he used a visual stimulisor of the broken glasses and found the missing glass from the murdered Don's car.

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 3/5 stars, calling it "more no-holds-barred slapstick action". Todd McCarthy of Deadline Hollywood was less favorable, writing: "Its enormous box office numbers notwithstanding, I have to rate Detective Chinatown 3 as something of a disappointment after the raucously engaging first two entries." John Berra of Screen International gave the film a favorable review, writing that it "exudes a heightened zaniness which is most welcome in today's largely homogenised franchise landscape" and "is an insanely colourful, no expense spared blockbuster". Chinese audiences on Maoyan gave the film a 8.8/10, while those on Douban gave it an average score of 5.6. "Box Office: 'Detective Chinatown 3' Tops 'Avengers: Endgame' With $160M Friday".
