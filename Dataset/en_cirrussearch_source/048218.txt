The 12 Treasures of Spain (Spanish: 12 Tesoros de España) was a project that selected the purported "Twelve Treasures of the Kingdom of Spain". The contest was conducted by broadcasters Antena 3 and COPE. The final results were announced on 31 December 2007. Nine architectural monuments, two natural monuments and a monument pictorial were chosen. Four months after the international competition to choose the New Seven Wonders of the World, in late September 2007, Antena 3 and Onda Cero launched a campaign to elect the 12 so-called Treasures of Spain, an initiative based on the votes of the people, through internet and mobile phone. Finally, they received over 9,000 applications, and the candidates were whittled down to 20. At first they were to choose 7 Treasures of Spain, but later that figure was changed to 12. The twelve winners in order of votes were: Cathedral of Córdoba Cave of Altamira Seville Cathedral Alhambra Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar Teide National Park Roman Theatre of Merida Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias Sagrada Família Beach of La Concha Guggenheim Museum Bilbao New 7 Wonders of Nature New 7 Wonders of the World Seven Wonders of the Ancient World Los 12 Tesoros de España Los 12 Tesoros de España se elegirán en Nochevieja
