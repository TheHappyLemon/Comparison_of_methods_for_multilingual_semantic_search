He is a follower of football, ice hockey and formula one. He supports the football team AC Sparta Praha. The 2022-23 season brought the best season for Krčmář in his career. He finished 13th in the overall standings, 9th in the individual, sprint and mass start standings and 14th in the pursuit standings. This included notable results in Pokljuka (5th in the sprint), Ruhpolding (8th in the individual), Östersund (4th in the mass start), and Oslo (10th in the sprint and 9th in the pursuit). The Czech team had their best season for many years as well placing 6th in the nations cup (their best result since the 2015-16 season). In August 2023 he suffered from a viral infection that briefly prevented him from training. Competing during the 2023-24 season, he reached the top 10 in Lenzerheide (8th place in the mass start). Inconsistent results at the beginning of the second trimester as well as health issues forced him to withdraw from the World Cup in Antholz in order to prepare for the World Championships.
