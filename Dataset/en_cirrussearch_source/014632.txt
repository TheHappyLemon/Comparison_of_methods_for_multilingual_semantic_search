The Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR was established in 1940 as the People's Saeima and finally disbanded in 1990 and was briefly succeeded by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia. According to the 1978 Constitution of the Latvian SSR, representatives could serve an unlimited amount of five-year terms. The Supreme Soviet consisted of 325 deputies before its dissolution. The structure and functions of the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR were copied from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The sessions of the Supreme Soviet lasted only several days twice a year and decisions were made unanimously and without much discussion. Elections for the Supreme Soviet were held in 1947, 1951, 1955, 1959, 1963, 1967, 1971, 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1990. The amount of deputies in the Supreme Soviet was increased from 310 to 325 in the 1978 Constitution of the Latvian SSR.
