The ZB-30 and ZB-30J were Czechoslovakian light machine guns that saw extensive use during World War II. The Zb 30 and Zb 30J were the later versions of the famous Czechoslovak machine gun, the ZB-26. However, the ZB-30 had some design differences, making it similar to the later ZGB-33, which was an early prototype of the Bren gun. Like the ZB-26, the Wehrmacht adopted the ZB-30 after the occupation of Czechoslovakia, renaming it the MG30(t); it was used in the same role as the MG34, as a light machine gun. In the opening phases of World War II, the ZB-30 in 7.92 mm Mauser caliber was used in large numbers by elements of the German Waffen-SS, who did not initially have full access to standard Wehrmacht supply channels. Comparison of original ZB vz.26 and modifications: Note - The ZB 30J was a late design iteration of the ZB 30 for sale to Yugoslavia (originally spelled with a J) that featured an adjustable gas system so that commonly available light and heavy 7.92mm ball ammunition would cycle the mechanism.  Kingdom of Afghanistan: 2,000 in 7.92mm Mauser caliber shipped in 1938  Algeria: used by the National Liberation Army.  Biafra  Bolivia: 3,350 in 7.65mm Mauser between 1932 and 1937, used in the Chaco War  Bulgaria: used as aircraft gun on Kaproni Bulgarski KB-11 Fazan[citation needed]  Czechoslovakia Republic of China: Imported and produced under license.  Ecuador 750 7.92mm Mauser in 1935-1936  Ethiopia: 400-450 in 7.92mm Mauser ZB vz.30 bought in 1934, used by the Kebur Zabagna  Nazi Germany  Guatemala: 50 in 7mm Mauser, delivered in 1937  Iran: produced under license.
