Shock Value is the second solo studio album by record producer Timbaland. The album was released in the UK on April 2, 2007, and released in the US one day later. It is Timbaland's first release on his own imprint, the Interscope Records-distributed Mosley Music Group. Shock Value features a long list of guest artists, among them Fall Out Boy, Justin Timberlake, the Hives, Keri Hilson, Nelly Furtado, Missy Elliott, 50 Cent, Tony Yayo, Dr. Dre, OneRepublic, Elton John, Magoo and Nicole Scherzinger. "Release" is featured in the EA Sports game Madden NFL 08 and "The Way I Are" is also on the soundtrack of NBA Live 08. On April 16, the unreleased song "Laugh at 'Em" was leaked to the internet. It was originally supposed to be on the album but was not completed in time. It features Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake. The song is now known as the "Give It to Me" remix. Another unreleased track called "I See U", featuring Attitude and D.O.E., was also leaked to the internet. An instrumental version of the album was released on the iTunes Store on July 31, 2007. The album was supposed to be supported by a Shock Value 2008 Tour. The tour was to begin in Australia and continue to New Zealand, but was postponed and then canceled because the expected amount that Showtime Touring was to pay Timbaland was unavailable, and the star refused to perform. There had also been many scheduling conflicts with Europe. The tour was canceled one day before it was to begin. Shock Value received generally mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received a weighted mean score of 54, based on 24 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
