The Switzerland men's national ice hockey team (German: Schweizer Eishockeynationalmannschaft; French: Équipe de Suisse de hockey sur glace; Italian: Nazionale di hockey su ghiaccio della Svizzera) is a founding member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and is controlled by the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation. As of 2022, the Swiss team is ranked 7th in the IIHF World Rankings. Bibi Torriani served as the Switzerland national team captain from 1933 to 1939. He played on a forward line known as "The ni-storm" (German: Der ni-sturm), with brothers Hans Cattini and Ferdinand Cattini. The line was named for the last syllable (-ni) of players' surnames. The ni-storm was regarded as the top line of HC Davos and Switzerland's national hockey team. Torriani served as head coach of the Switzerland men's national ice hockey team in 1946–47, and again from 1948 to 1949 to 1951–52. From a bronze medal at the 1953 World Championships until the silver medal of 2013 and 2018, Switzerland did not win a medal at a major senior ice hockey tournament, coming close in 1992 and 1998, when they finished in 4th place at the World Championships both years.[citation needed] Before the 2013 IIHF World Championship, the Swiss national hockey team scored two historic upsets at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, defeating the Czech Republic 3–2 and shutting out Canada 2–0 two days later. They finally fell to Sweden in the quarterfinals. At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, the Swiss nearly stunned Canada again in round-robin play, taking the heavily favored Canadians to a shootout, which they lost 1–0 for a narrow 3–2 loss.[citation needed] 1930 – Won bronze medal 1933 – Finished tied in 5th place 1934 – Finished in 4th place 1935 – Won silver medal 1937 – Won bronze medal 1938 – Finished in 6th place 1939 – Won bronze medal 1947 – Finished in 4th place 1949 – Finished in 5th place 1950 – Won bronze medal awarded Silver as European Champion 1951 – Won bronze medal 1953 – Won bronze medal 1954 – Finished in 7th place 1955 – Finished in 8th place 1959 – Finished in 12th place 1961 – Finished in 11th place (3rd in Pool B) 1962 – Finished in 7th place 1963 – Finished in 10th place (2nd in Pool B) 1965 – Finished in 10th place (2nd in Pool B) 1966 – Finished in 14th place (6th in Pool B) 1967 – Finished in 15th place (7th in Pool B) 1969 – Finished in 16th place (2nd in Pool C) 1970 – Finished in 12th place (6th in Pool B) 1971 – Finished in 7th place (won Pool B) 1972 – Finished in 6th place 1973 – Finished in 13th place (7th in Pool B) 1974 – Finished in 15th place (won Pool C) 1975 – Finished in 9th place (2nd in Pool B) 1976 – Finished in 12th place (4th in Pool B) 1977 – Finished in 13th place (5th in Pool B) 1978 – Finished in 11th place (3rd in Pool B) 1979 – Finished in 13th place (5th in Pool B) 1981 – Finished in 11th place (3rd in Pool B) 1982 – Finished in 14th place (6th in Pool B) 1983 – Finished in 14th place (6th in Pool B) 1985 – Finished in 10th place (2nd in Pool B) 1986 – Finished in 9th place (won Pool B) 1987 – Finished in 8th place 1989 – Finished in 12th place (4th in Pool B) 1990 – Finished in 9th place (won Pool B) 1991 – Finished in 7th place 1992 – Finished in 4th place 1993 – Finished in 10th place 1994 – Finished in 13th place (won Pool B) 1995 – Finished in 12th place 1996 – Finished in 14th place (2nd in Pool B) 1997 – Finished in 15th place (3rd in Pool B) 1998 – Finished in 4th place 1999 – Finished in 8th place 2000 – Finished in 6th place 2001 – Finished in 9th place 2002 – Finished in 9th place 2003 – Finished in 8th place 2004 – Finished in 8th place 2005 – Finished in 8th place 2006 – Finished in 9th place 2007 – Finished in 8th place 2008 – Finished in 7th place 2009 – Finished in 9th place 2010 – Finished in 5th place 2011 – Finished in 9th place 2012 – Finished in 11th place 2013 – Won silver medal 2014 – Finished in 10th place 2015 – Finished in 8th place 2016 – Finished in 11th place 2017 – Finished in 6th place 2018 – Won silver medal 2019 – Finished in 8th place 2020 – Cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic 2021 – Finished in 6th place 2022 – Finished in 5th place 2023 – Finished in 5th place 2024 – 1964 – Finished in 4th place 1967 – Won bronze medal 1968 – Finished in 4th place 1972 – Finished in 4th place 1974 – Finished in 4th place 1975 – Finished in 4th place 1976 – Won bronze medal 1977 – Finished in 5th place 1978 – Finished in 5th place 1979 – Finished in 5th place 2017 – Won silver medal Roster for the 2023 IIHF World Championship.
