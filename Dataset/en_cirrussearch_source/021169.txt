7°8′55.41″S 34°47′48.82″W﻿ / ﻿7.1487250°S 34.7968944°W﻿ / -7.1487250; -34.7968944 Ponta do Seixas (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈpõtɐ du ˈsejʃɐs]), is a beach on the Atlantic coast of Paraíba state, eastern Brazil, that forms the easternmost point of the American double-continent, roughly 8 km (5 mi) southeast of João Pessoa, the state capital. It is surrounded by white sand beaches bordered by flat-topped forms of sedimentary strata called "tabuleiros", which rise sharply above the beaches to heights between 150 and 500 ft, and enjoys abundant rainfall. It lies on the coastal highway connecting João Pessoa and the port of Cabedelo farther north. A few meters away from the beach is one of the city's most important and visited postcards, the Cabo Branco Lighthouse, which is very close to Cabo Branco Station. Opened in 1972, the Cabo Branco Lighthouse has a unique triangular shape in the country. From the Lighthouse, visitors have a privileged and surprising view of a large part of the coastline of João Pessoa. A very common mistake that foreigners do is to confuse Cabo Branco with Ponta dos Seixas. These two are different official neighborhoods and separate beaches. "Cape Branco | cape, Brazil".
