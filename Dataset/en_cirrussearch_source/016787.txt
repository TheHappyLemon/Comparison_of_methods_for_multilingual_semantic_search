Kenneth Bernard Faried Lewis (/fərˈiːd/ fə-REED; born November 19, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Cangrejeros de Santurce of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN). Known as "the Manimal" due to his hustle on the court, he attended Morehead State University for four years, twice being named the Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year. He finished his collegiate career as the NCAA all-time leading rebounder in the post-1973 era with 1,673 rebounds. He was selected 22nd overall in the 2011 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. Faried played for the United States national team at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, where he won a gold medal and was named to the All-Tournament Team. Faried attended Technology High School in Newark, New Jersey. Due to his lanky physique and low standardized test scores, he was not heavily recruited out of high school, only receiving interest from Iona College, Marist College, and Morehead State University. He ultimately chose to attend Morehead State, citing their persistence as the deciding factor. A 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) post player, Faried arrived at Morehead State in 2007. He led the Ohio Valley Conference in rebounding as both a sophomore and a junior (13.0 rebounds per game in each season) – ranking him third in the NCAA in 2008–09 and second in 2009–10. Faried also chipped in double-digit scoring in each of his three varsity seasons. Faried also led the Eagles to team success, as Morehead claimed a berth in the 2009 NCAA tournament by winning the Ohio Valley Conference tournament. He led the way in the conference championship, his 15 points and 17 rebounds in its final against Austin Peay earning him the tournament's MVP. In his junior year Faried again led the Eagles to the post-season, as they advanced to the second round of the College Basketball Invitational. At the end of the season, Faried was named OVC Player and Defensive Player of the Year and an AP honorable mention All-American. He also passed 1000 rebounds for his career. After his junior season, Faried declared himself eligible for the 2010 NBA draft. However, he elected to return as a senior, and went on to break Tim Duncan's modern-era (post-1973) Division I career rebounding record of 1,570 rebounds. The mark, which had stood since 1997, fell to Faried's 12 rebounds in the Eagles' 71–65 victory over Indiana State on February 19, 2011. Morehead State again won the Ohio Valley conference tournament, earning a 13 seed in the 2011 NCAA tournament. Led by the play of Faried, Morehead State pulled off a huge upset in the first round of the tournament, toppling the 4 seed Louisville Cardinals. Faried ended his collegiate career with 1,673 rebounds. In his senior season, Faried was named a second-team All-American by the United States Basketball Writers Association and Fox Sports. On April 1, 2011, Faried was named the most valuable player of the Reese's College All-Star Game. Consensus second team All-American (2011) NABC Defensive Player of the Year (2011) 2× OVC Player of the Year (2010–2011) OVC tournament MVP (2009) Reese's College All-Star Game MVP (2011) 3× All-OVC First Team (2009–2011) 3× OVC Defensive Player of the Year (2009–2011) OVC All-Newcomer Team (2008) NCAA all-time rebounding leader (1,673 rebounds) (post-1973) On June 23, 2011, Faried was selected by the Denver Nuggets with the 22nd overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft.

He appeared in 46 games (39 starts) in his rookie year, recording 10.2 points and 7.7 rebounds per game in 22.5 minutes. He posted career highs of 27 points and 17 rebounds against the Golden State Warriors on April 9, 2012, becoming the first player in the shot-clock era to have at least 27 points and 17 rebounds while playing less than 25 minutes. He went on to be named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for April. He finished third in NBA Rookie of the Year voting for the 2011–12 season, and earned NBA All-Rookie Team honors.

Faried suffered through a sore back for much of the 2016–17 season and caused him to miss 15 games overall, most of which were in February, March and the final games in April. He played through the pain in many others. He played in 61 games overall with averages of 9.6 points and 7.5 rebounds in 21.2 minutes, all career lows.
