Salem Mohammed Shafi Al-Dawsari (Arabic: سالم محمد شافي الدوسري; born 19 August 1991), known as Salem, is a Saudi Arabian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal and the Saudi Arabia national team. Salem Al-Dawasari has spent his entire career at Al Hilal (apart from one year where he spent on loan). As part of a deal between the Saudi Arabian Football Federation and La Liga, he joined Spanish club Villarreal on loan. He made one appearance in Spain, coming on as a substitute against Real Madrid as Villarreal came from behind to draw 2–2. In the second leg of the 2019 AFC Champions League final on 24 November, Al-Dawsari scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–0 away win over Urawa Red Diamonds, which saw Al-Hilal win the title following a 3–0 aggregate victory; the title allowed them to qualify for the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup. On 7 February 2023, Al-Dawsari scored two penalties in a 3–2 win over Flamengo in the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup semi-final, helping his club reach the final for the first time in their history. Al-Dawsari was called up to the Saudi Arabia national team for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, and scored his first international goal in an away match against Australia in 2012. In May 2018, he was named in Saudi Arabia's preliminary squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. On 25 June, Al-Dawsari scored a late winning goal as his side won 2–1 over Egypt in their last group stage match of the World Cup. On 22 November 2022, Al-Dawsari scored his second goal at a FIFA World Cup, his first at the 2022 edition in Qatar in a match against Argentina. He made a run around the box before finishing past Emiliano Martínez to put Saudi Arabia ahead by a score of 2–1, which ended in a historic shock victory for the Saudi Arabia national team. On 30 November, he scored a goal against Mexico, in which he equaled the record of most goals scored by a Saudi player in World Cups, three goals by Sami Al-Jaber, as Saudi Arabia exited the World Cup with a 2–1 loss to Mexico.
