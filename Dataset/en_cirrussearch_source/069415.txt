He and his mother moved to London in 1995. Mackampa began playing guitar and composing songs at the age of 12. He attended the Cardinal Wiseman Catholic School in Coventry. As a teenager, he would record music in a studio in the neighbourhood youth center. He went on to study music at the University of Northampton. Mackampa has named soul singers such as Marvin Gaye and Bill Withers as shaping his musical style. In 2016, Mackampa self-released his EP, Physics.

Mackampa signed a record deal with AWAL Recordings in 2017 and released his first studio album, Foreigner, in March 2020. The album addresses Mackampa's experiences growing up as a Congolese immigrant in England.
