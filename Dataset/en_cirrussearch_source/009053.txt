Mark Lapush, Grigorenko's agent, said, "They gave him a 10-percent chance to be alive, and he made it. He’s feeling good. He said, 'Mark, trust me, I’m going to play hockey. I’m going to play for Detroit.'" He signed a one-year, entry-level contract with the Detroit Red Wings in May, 2007, but was unable to make the team out of training camp.
