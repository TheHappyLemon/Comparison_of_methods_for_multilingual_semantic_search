The 1996 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXVI Olympiad, were a summer multi-sport event held in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, from July 19 to August 4. A total of 10,339 athletes from 197 nations participated in 271 events in 26 sports across 37 disciplines. Overall, 79 nations received at least one medal, and 53 of them won at least one gold medal. Athletes from host nation United States won the most medals overall, with 101, and the most gold medals, with 44. It marked the first time the United States led the medal count in both gold and overall medals since 1984 and the first at a non-boycotted Olympics since 1968. Russia won the second most gold medals (26) and the third most total medals (63). Germany won the third most gold medals (20) and the second most total medals (65). Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Slovakia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan were represented for the first time at a Summer Games. Czech Republic and Slovakia had competed previously as Czechoslovakia, and the other nations were formerly part of the Soviet Union. Of these, only Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan did not receive any medals. The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals.
