Michael J. Reilly Jr. (born July 13, 1993) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman for the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was originally selected by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the fourth round (98th overall) of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft and previously played in the NHL for the Minnesota Wild, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers. Born in Chicago, Reilly grew up in Chanhassen, Minnesota. After attending and playing for the Academy of Holy Angels and Shattuck-St Mary's, Reilly was selected by the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Opting not to sign with the Blue Jackets, he went on to play for the University of Minnesota. Reilly was named Big Ten Conference's Defensive Player of the Year and First Team All-American following both his sophomore and junior seasons. Reilly became an unrestricted free agent on June 15, 2015, after he was unable to come to terms on a contract with Columbus. On July 1, he signed a two-year, entry-level contract with the Minnesota Wild worth $1.85 million, and on January 9, 2016, Reilly made his NHL debut in a 2–1 victory over the Dallas Stars. He scored his first NHL goal on February 13, in a 4–2 loss to the Boston Bruins. On February 26, 2018, Minnesota traded Reilly to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for a fifth-round pick in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. He signed a two-year extension with Montreal worth $3 million following the 2018–19 season. On January 2, 2020, Reilly was traded to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Andrew Sturtz and a fifth-round pick in 2021. After parts of two seasons in Ottawa, Reilly was traded to the Boston Bruins in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft on April 11, 2021. On July 27, Reilly signed a three-year, $9 million contract extension with the Bruins. Due to the Bruins battling salary cap issues, while in just his second season with the club in 2022–23, Reilly was placed on waivers by the Bruins on November 9, 2022. In clearing the following day, Reilly's cap hit was buried and he was re-assigned and played the remainder of the season with the Bruins' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Providence Bruins. On February 24, 2023, Reilly scored his first professional hat-trick in a 6–5 win for Providence, adding two assists as well, resulting in a five-point night. Having completed the season, on June 30, 2023, Reilly was placed on unconditional waivers for the purpose of a buyout from the remaining year of his contract with the Bruins. Released to be a free agent, Reilly was immediately signed on the opening day of free agency to a one-year, $1 million contract with the Florida Panthers on July 1. Entering the 2023–24 season, Reilly was a healthy scratch for the Panthers through the first month of the season before making his debut in a 5–4 overtime victory over the Blue Jackets on November 6, 2023. Reilly was scoreless in two games with the Panthers before he was placed on waivers and later claimed by the New York Islanders on November 25. He made his Islanders debut in a 5–4 defeat by the New Jersey Devils on November 28. His first goal with the Islanders was in a 5–4 overtime loss to the San Jose Sharks on December 5. Reilly's father, Michael Sr., was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the eighth round of the 1977 NHL Amateur Draft, but ultimately never played in the NHL. "Wild Signs Defenseman Mike Reilly".
