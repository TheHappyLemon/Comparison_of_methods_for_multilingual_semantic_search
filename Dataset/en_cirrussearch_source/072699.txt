BK Skonto is the name of a former professional basketball club that was based in Riga, Latvia. BK Skonto was founded in 2001 as a basketball section of FC Skonto. The basketball team was founded by FC Skonto president Guntis Indriksons and basketball legend Valdis Valters. Skonto took the place in Latvian Basketball League from BK Brocēni, another basketball club from Riga, which stopped to exist in 2001. Skonto's main focus was developing young Latvian talents and they did so by developing players such as Andris Biedriņš, Kristaps Valters, Jānis Blūms, Sandis Valters, Kaspars Bērziņš, Kristaps Janičenoks and others. Skonto lasted for three seasons, making the Latvian league finals in every one of them. In 2004 club's president Guntis Indriksons announced that he would not continue to support the basketball section, thus, ending the existence of BK Skonto.
