Eero Einar Böök (9 February 1910 – 7 January 1990) was a Finnish chess player and engineer. A five-time Finnish champion who represented his country six times in the Chess Olympiad, Böök was awarded the International Master title in 1950 and became an honorary Grandmaster in 1984. His only significant international tournament victory was a tie for first place with Gösta Stoltz in the 1947 Nordic Championship in Helsinki. Perhaps his best tournament finish was sharing eleventh place in the category 14 interzonal, Saltsjöbaden 1948. Böök played many of the world's top players, and had a plus record against Miguel Najdorf (+1 −0 =2). He beat Max Euwe with the black pieces in Dubrovnik in 1950, as well as the Estonian chess player Paul Keres in the 1952 Helsinki Olympiad. Böök also wrote several chess books.
