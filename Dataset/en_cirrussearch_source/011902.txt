Pilař made his North American hockey debut during the 2001–02 NHL season, playing 52 games for the St. John's Maple Leafs of the AHL and earning himself a promotion to their parent club, the Toronto Maple Leafs, for the remainder of the season.

Once healthy, Pilař returned to North American ice 2007, playing the final 10 games of the season with the Toronto Marlies of the AHL. Seeking an opportunity for an NHL comeback, Pilař signed with the Atlanta Thrashers for the 2007–2008 season. After being claimed by the Chicago Blackhawks from waivers during training camp and re-claimed by the Thrashers, he was assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Chicago Wolves. On January 14, 2009, he left Metallurg Magnitogorsk and returned to the Czech Republic, where he signed a contract to play for Sparta Praha.
