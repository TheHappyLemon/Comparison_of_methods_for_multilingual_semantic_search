Zhu Chen (simplified Chinese: 诸宸; traditional Chinese: 諸宸; pinyin: Zhū Chén, Arabic: زو تشن; born March 13, 1976) is a Chinese-born Qatari chess Grandmaster. In 1999, she became China's second women's world chess champion after Xie Jun, and China's 13th Grandmaster. In 2006, she obtained Qatari citizenship and since then has played for Qatar. In 1988 Zhu became the first Chinese player to win an international chess competition when she won the World Girls Under-12 Championship in Romania. She won the World Junior Girls Chess Championship in 1994 and 1996. When she became Grandmaster in 1999, she was the seventh woman to do so. At the age of 25 she defeated Alexandra Kosteniuk of Russia in a tournament for the 2001/2002 Women's World Chess Championship, by 5–3, becoming the ninth champion. Zhu gave up the chance to defend her world title in Georgia in May 2004 due to a jammed schedule and her pregnancy. In June 2004, Zhu played two games against the chess computer "Star of Unisplendour", which was an advanced AMD 64 bit 3400+ CPU and 2 GB RAM combined with the chess engine Fritz 8. She lost both games. Zhu is married to Qatari Grandmaster Mohamad Al-Modiahki, and now represents Qatar. As of 2010, they have two daughters: Dana (b. 2004) and Hind (b. 2008). She also studied for a master's degree at Tsinghua University. 1988.25 July-7 August, World Girls Under 12 Championship. 1st place - Romania 1990.5–19 September, Chinese National Women's Individual Championship "Group B".1st place - China 1991, Chinese National Women's Individual Championship. 2nd place - Chengdu China 1992.
