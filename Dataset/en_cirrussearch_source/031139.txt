Danmark Rundt is a Danish multi-day professional road cycling race. It is currently sponsored by the Danish national postal agency, PostNord, and the race is therefore also known as PostNord Danmark Rundt. The race is sometimes called the Tour of Denmark in English language media. The race has been on the UCI ProSeries calendar since 2021, after being cancelled in 2020. Traditionally, the race starts off on the Jutland peninsula and ends on the island of Zealand – on Frederiksberg Allé in Copenhagen. Since 2004, one of the stages has included the steep street Kiddesvej in the city of Vejle. It's this hilly stage and the time trial that usually determine who will win the general classification. The race was first run yearly from 1985 to 1988 and, after a break of 7 years, from 1995 onwards. It attracts approximately half a million spectators on the road.[citation needed] After no less than five second places overall, including twice before the race hiatus of 1989–1994, Rolf Sørensen finally secured overall victory in his home race in 2000. In 2004 it was won by Kurt Asle Arvesen, after his Team CSC teammate Jens Voigt let him win an intermediate sprint, so Arvesen finished 2 seconds ahead in the overall classification. In 2005 Ivan Basso of Team CSC, coming off the 2005 Tour de France as the overall runner-up, totally dominated the race, and won overall as well as 4 out of 6 stages. Since the race was run at the same time as the UCI ProTour race Eneco Tour, only three UCI ProTour teams participated. In 2006, the race was won by Fabian Cancellara of CSC ahead of Stuart O'Grady, also of CSC and in 2007 Kurt Asle Arvesen returned to win for the second time, being the first in history to do so, and giving Team CSC its 4th consecutive win. In 2008 Jakob Fuglsang from Team Designa Køkken became the first Dane to win since 2002. In 2009 he became the first rider to win the race two years in a row before going on to win for a third consecutive year in 2010. Fuglsang was succeeded by Australian rider Simon Gerrans in 2011, Lieuwe Westra in 2012 and Wilco Kelderman in 2013. The 2014 Danmark Rundt was won by Danish rider Michael Valgren of the Tinkoff–Saxo team. The 2015 edition was planned to start on 4 August 2014, with the first stage scheduled to begin in Struer and end in Holstebro. It ended on 8 August. The 2015 Danmark Rundt was won by Danish rider Christopher Juul-Jensen of the Tinkoff–Saxo team. Various secondary competitions have been held over the years. *In 1985, 1986 and 1987 the competition was for riders under 23 years, in 1988 the bar was raised to 24 years, and in 2000 and later editions, it has been for riders born in or after (race year) – 25 years (i.e. in 2000 they had to be born in or after 1975).[dubious – discuss] In addition to the five competitions above, in all editions except the 1985 and 1995 ones, a fighter competition was held. Until 2000, a sprint competition was held. In 1987 and 1988 a "Best Dane" competition was held. In 1995, a "Best Amateur" competition was held.
