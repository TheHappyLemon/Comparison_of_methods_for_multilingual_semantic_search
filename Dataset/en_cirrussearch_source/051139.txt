Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport (IATA: FKB, ICAO: EDSB) (German: Flughafen Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden) is the international airport of Karlsruhe, the third-largest city in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, and also serves the spa town of Baden-Baden. It is the state's second-largest airport after Stuttgart Airport, and the 13th-largest in Germany with 1,731,055 passengers as of 2023 and mostly serves low-cost and leisure flights. The airport itself is part of Baden Airpark, a business park with numerous other tenants. It is located in Rheinmünster, 40 km (25 mi) south of Karlsruhe, 12 km (7.5 mi) west of Baden-Baden, 25 km (16 mi) east of Haguenau and 25 km (16 mi) north of Strasbourg, France. The construction of a military airfield began in December 1951 in the Upper Rhine Plain between the Black Forest and the Rhine River under the supervision of the French Air Force. The runway and associated facilities were completed by June 1952. The airfield was granted to Canadian forces and became a military base, RCAF Station Baden–Soellingen, later renamed CFB Baden–Soellingen, from 1953 until 1994. The newly founded Baden Airpark GmbH took over the former military airfield to develop it into a regional airport and business park. Technically, the airport itself today is part of the Baden Airpark, which also includes business facilities. The first commercial flight from Hapag-Lloyd Flug (now TUI fly Deutschland) took place in April 2001 with service to Palma de Mallorca and Ibiza. In 2008 the airport counted over one million passengers within a year for the first time.

In July 2018, TUI fly Deutschland announced that it would terminate its operations at the airport, cancelling seven year-round and seasonal leisure routes to the Canaries and the Mediterranean.
