HK Dinaburga are a professional Latvian ice hockey team that plays in the Optibet Hockey League, the top tier of the sport in Latvia. The team is based in Daugavpils and play their home games at the Daugavpils Ice Arena. The team was founded in 2013, initially playing under the name of the city in which they're located; Daugavpils. The previous team in the city, DHK Latgale, folded at the culmination of the 2011-12 season. They began play in the Latvian Hockey League, the top tier of hockey in Latvia, during the 2013-14 season, however, they performed poorly winning only one game. Following this, the team dropped down a league to the newly formed Latvian 1st Division where they remained until 2019. Daugavpils would find more success in the second tier of Latvian hockey, winning the league in 2016, and finishing top of the table in the regular season in both 2017 and 2019. Following the culmination of the 2019 Daugavpils changed their name to HK Dinaburga, taking the moniker of a nearby castle, and rejoined the Latvian Hockey League, now known as the Optibet Hockey League for sponsorship reasons. In their first season back in the top tier, Dinaburga were in 6th place out of 8 teams before the play-offs were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Updated February 11, 2021.
