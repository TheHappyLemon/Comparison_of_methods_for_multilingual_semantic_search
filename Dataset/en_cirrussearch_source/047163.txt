Falkenbergs Fotbollsförening, also known simply as Falkenbergs FF, Falkenberg or (especially locally) FFF, is a Swedish football club based in Falkenberg. Formed on 3 January 1928, the club plays in the third highest Swedish league, Ettan Fotboll. Falkenberg are affiliated with Hallands Fotbollförbund. During the first thirty seasons of Falkenbergs FF, the club spent most of its time in Division 3. In the early years, the club also played bandy and handball. In the early seventies (1973 and 1974), FFF were in Division 6. However, they would then start ascending in the Swedish league system, earning two consecutive promotions in 1986 to Division 2 and in 1987 to Division 1, which was then the second tier of Swedish football. The following season in 1988, Falkenberg played their first season in the second division. After twelve rounds of play in 1998, Falkenbergs FF led Division 1 Södra and had their sights set on qualifying for Allsvenskan. But the club's success would not last all 26 rounds and they finished seventh in the league table. As of 28 January 2024 Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.
