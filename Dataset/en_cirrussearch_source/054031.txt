The 2020 Bretagne Classic Ouest–France was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 25 August 2020 in France. It was the 84th edition of Bretagne Classic Ouest–France and the 11th event of the 2020 UCI World Tour. Twenty-five teams, including all 19 UCI WorldTour teams and six UCI Professional Continental teams, were scheduled to participate in the race. All but two teams, those EF Pro Cycling and Total Direct Énergie which each entered six riders, entered seven riders. On the morning of the race, an unnamed Bora–Hansgrohe rider tested positive for COVID-19, so the entire team decided to pull out of the race. This meant that 166 riders started the race, of which 104 finished. After the race, Ralph Denk the team boss of Bora–Hansgrohe, raised concerns about the COVID-19 test, after it returned a false positive.
