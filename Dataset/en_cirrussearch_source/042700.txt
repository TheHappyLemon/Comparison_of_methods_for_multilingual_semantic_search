Michael Raffl (born 1 December 1988) is an Austrian professional ice hockey left winger currently with Lausanne HC of the Swiss National League (NL). He previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Philadelphia Flyers, Washington Capitals and Dallas Stars, as well as EC VSV in the Austrian ICE Hockey League (IceHL).

Raffl and his older brother Thomas spent most of their childhood in the Villacher Stadthalle arena. Raffl said that it was "pretty popular to play hockey" in Villach, "but it wasn't professional", and it was difficult for players to head overseas and play in the National Hockey League (NHL). Growing up, he was close friends with future NHL player Michael Grabner, who lived "a two-minute walk" away from the Raffls. As a youth, Raffl played in the 2002 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Austria. On 31 May 2013 Raffl signed a one-year, entry-level contract with the Philadelphia Flyers. He began the 2013–14 season with the Flyers AHL affiliate, the Adirondack Phantoms.

On November 28, 2020, Raffl was loaned by the Flyers to Villacher SV in the ICE Hockey League until the commencement of the delayed 2020–21 North American season. He played four games there before he was recalled to the Flyers. At the NHL trade deadline on April 12, 2021, the Flyers traded Raffl to the Washington Capitals in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick. His debut with the team was delayed after suffering an upper-body injury with the Flyers, and he began practicing with the team on April 21.
