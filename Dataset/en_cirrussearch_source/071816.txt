Soyuz MS-25 is an ongoing Russian crewed Soyuz spaceflight from Baikonur Cosmodrome to the International Space Station. This is the first launch of two women, Tracy Caldwell-Dyson from US and Marina Vasilevskaya from Belarus, aboard a Soyuz spacecraft. The mission commander is Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky, born in Chervyen, Minsk Voblast, Byelorussian SSR, USSR (now Belarus). Primary Crew Backup crew It was originally scheduled for launch on 21 March 2024, but due to a voltage drop in one of the power generators, the launch was aborted. The second launch attempt on 23 March 2024 was successful. Dyson will spend approximately six months aboard the International Space Station. Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky and spaceflight participant Marina Vasilevskaya of Belarus will spend approximately 12 days aboard the orbital complex as a part of 21st ISS visiting expedition. After completing her expedition, Dyson will return to Earth on 24 September 2024 with Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub on the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft. Kononenko and Chub have been on the ISS since September 2023. They arrived with NASA astronaut Loral O’Hara on the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft. Kononenko and Chub will remain aboard the orbital laboratory for about one year. If the mission lasts 300–365 days, Kononenko will have spent a total of 1,036–1,101 days in space, exceeding the current record of 878 days by Gennady Padalka. He will thus also become the first person to stay 1,000 days in space. O’Hara, who will spend six months aboard the space station, will return with Novitsky and Vasilevskaya on the Soyuz MS-24 spacecraft.  This article incorporates public domain material from NASA Astronaut Tracy C.
