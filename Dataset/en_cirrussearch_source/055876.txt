Khazret Sultan (Uzbek: Hazrati Sulton choʻqqisi) is a mountain formerly considered to be the highest point of Uzbekistan, with an elevation of 4,643 metres (15,233 ft). The mountain is located on the border of Uzbekistan's Surkhondaryo Region and Tajikistan's Sughd Region, in the Gissar Range. The mountain was formerly known as "Peak of the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party". It is not to be confused with another Uzbek mountain named Mount Khazret Sultan, which, at an elevation of 4,083 metres (13,396 ft), is a holy mountain climbed by pilgrims. In August 2023, an expedition by country highpointers Eric Gilbertson & Andreas Frydensberg climbed both Khazret Sultan and another peak on the Uzbekistan-Tajikistan border named Alpomish. Using professional survey equipment, they determined Alpomish to be 4,668 metres (15,315 ft) above sea level, making it 25 meters higher than Khazret Sultan and therefore the true country highpoint of Uzbekistan.
