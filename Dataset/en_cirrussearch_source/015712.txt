"Let Yourself Go" was described as a return to punk rock in contrast to the band's previous two singles "Oh Love" and "Kill the DJ" by VH1's Zara Golden. The song was stylistically compared to their 1990s roots with a tone and style that imitates the band's work from Dookie and Insomniac. Slant Magazine had said that it also reflects the style of Van Halen from the 1980s. David Fricke of the Rolling Stone in a review of ¡Uno! compared the theme of the song with "Stay the Night", another song on the album, stating; "'Stay the Night' and 'Let Yourself Go' are the kind of pop-smart here's-my-fucking-problem miniatures Armstrong was writing like second nature when he, Dirnt and Cool were too young to drink (legally) where they gigged. But Armstrong is 40 now, married and a dad, and a lot of this ruckus sounds designed to drown out the time bombs ticking in his head and the maddening static outside". The song received positive reception from the critics, mainly focusing on the song's references to Green Day's stylistic origins. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised the song, describing it as a "blistering [and] Ramones-tinged [song]." Katie Hasty of HitFix added to the song's familiarity, stating "It's back to the melodic, snotty sound of early Green Day, with some spit shine and a few f-bombs." At The Reporter, Stephen Moore described that the song was a "rant and snarl encouragingly" in which "[Cool's] rapid-fire drumming [was] conjuring up some of the Dookie magic". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune stated that the song was "undeniably sharp, [and] catchy" which was "hurtling on a wave of harmony vocals". Yorgo Douramacos at Slant Magazine noted it as an "occasional guitar solo" and further added that the song "steers a straightforward punk anthem toward early-'80s Van Halen territory." Randall Roberts from the Los Angeles Times described the song to be an "obvious chart-buster" and added that it would "no doubt be used to back NFL highlight reels for years to come." Scott Heisel from Alternative Press cited the song to be the fastest on the album by observing with "breaking 200 bpms and creating an instant sing-along with perfectly placed profanity. It's destined to become a live staple." Green Day played a secret-show in Costa Mesa, California on August 11, 2011, where they performed various songs from the upcoming album, including "Let Yourself Go". Later on, the song was also played at few other secret shows of the band. A recording of the band performing the song live at Red 7 in Austin, Texas on November 17, 2011 was released online on July 30, 2012 as the "official live video" for the song.
