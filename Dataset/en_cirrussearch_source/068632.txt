That match was also the final home game under manager Arsène Wenger, with Mavropanos keeping his first clean sheet as the team won 5–0. He also played in the following game away against Leicester City, but was sent off after 15 minutes to conclude his first season at Arsenal. At the beginning of October 2018, Mavropanos suffered a groin injury and was ruled out until mid-December.

On 25 February 2020, Mavropanos picked up an injury playing against Darmstadt 98; the club was unsure of how long he would be absent. On 16 July 2020, Mavropanos signed a new deal with Arsenal and joined VfB Stuttgart on a €250.000 loan for the 2020–21 season.

On 15 October 2020, Mavropanos suffered an injury during a friendly with SC Freiburg and underwent an operation on his meniscus.

On 22 August 2023, it was announced that Mavropanos had signed for English club West Ham United on a five-year contract for a €25 million fee. 10% of the transfer fee was payable to Arsenal as they had inserted a sell-on clause in the player's contract when he was sold in 2022.
