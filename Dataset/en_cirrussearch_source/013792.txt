Malchin (German pronunciation: [malˈçiːn]) is a town in the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte district, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, in north-eastern Germany. The name of the town is of Slavic origin. It was granted town rights in 1236. During World War II, in February 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Allied prisoners-of-war from the Stalag XX-B POW camp passed through the town. The former municipality Duckow was merged into Malchin in January 2019. It offers some notable landmarks, such as two Brick Gothic town gates, a medieval defense tower, the Gothic town church of St. John and the Neo Baroque town hall.
