Lettonia is a Latvian student fraternity, called a corporation in Latvia. It is the oldest active student fraternity in the country. Students at Tartu University established the fraternity Tērbata Latvian in 1870. Its name changed to Fraternitas Lettonica on December 3, 1881. Its current name, Lettonia, was adopted on February 20, 1882, when the government allowed the ethic-Latvian fraternity to incorporate. It expanded to the University of Latvia. In this era, activities included cultural activities, oratory, singing, and festival banquets. Membership was limited to ethnic Latvians; Jews, Russians, and Germans were not allowed to join. A modern historian notes that this was consistent with Latvia at the time—unwelcoming to those who were not of its own. Members of Lettonia fought for their country during World War I. During the occupation of Latvia, the fraternity ceased its operations. Some members were imprisoned while others managed to emigrate to safety. Before World War II, there were an estimated 500 members still in Latvia. At least seven members were early Nazi collaborators under the leadership of Lettonia member Viktors Arājs. Arājs set up Nazi recruitment tables in front of the Lettonia headquarters. The Lettonia presence was common enough amongst the Latvian–German collaborators that the Jews of the Riga ghetto called their guards "Arājsen Burschen" or "Arājs's fraternity brothers". However, more than half of the Lettonia membership had left Latvia by the end of the war. In 1989, Latvia was again free and the restored country's statutes were adopted on May 18, 1989. Rector J. Zakis approved the restoration of Lettonia to the country's colleges on July 4, 1989. Lettonia accepted its first class of new members in the fall of 1989. In 2020, it had around 150 (Latvian: pusotrs simts) with about 250 members living outside Latvia. The fraternity's name was selected based on the Latin version of their country's name. Its motto is "vitam, salutem, veritatem" or "Life, prosperity, truth". The rapier is its symbol, representing masculinity and courage. The fraternity holds literary evenings which are designed to expand its members' knowledge of topics such as art, history, literature, and science. and fencing. Fencing is also an important activity, included to help members to overcome fear and develop heroism.
