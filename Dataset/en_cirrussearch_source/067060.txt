The 2022–23 NHL season was the 106th season of operation (105th season of play) of the National Hockey League (NHL). The regular season began on October 7, 2022, when the San Jose Sharks and the Nashville Predators played the first of two games in Prague, Czech Republic as a part of the 2022 NHL Global Series. The playoffs concluded on June 13, with the Vegas Golden Knights defeating the Florida Panthers in the Stanley Cup Finals in five games, winning their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. In addition to sponsor logos on helmets (helmet entitlement partner), teams were allowed to also sell another sponsor placement on their players' jerseys (jersey patch partner) this season. The jersey sponsor patches had to be no greater than 3 by 3+1⁄2 inches (7.62 cm × 8.89 cm). The following teams announced their jersey sponsors: Arizona: Gila River Resort & Casino (home) Boston: Rapid7 Columbus: Safelite Florida: AutoNation (away) Minnesota: TRIA Montreal: RBC (home) Pittsburgh: Highmark (home) St. Louis: Stifel Toronto: Dairy Farmers of Ontario Vancouver: TD Bank (home) Vegas: Circa Las Vegas (home) Washington: Caesars Sportsbook (home) Winnipeg: Canada Life After previous trials during the 2016 World Cup of Hockey and 2020 NHL All-Star Game, the NHL deployed digitally enhanced dasherboards, using Supponor technology, at all arenas this season. This allows the digital replacement and insertion of advertising on the rink boards on selected camera angles, which can be localized for individual regional, national, and international broadcasters. These advertising units include logo placements similar to the boards seen in person (which will still be shown on camera angles that do not support ad replacement), and larger "zone"-based units across sections of the boards, or the entire board. The 2022 NHL Entry Draft was held on July 7–8, 2022, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, the home of the Montreal Canadiens. Juraj Slafkovsky was selected first overall by the Canadiens. The league held preseason games in Europe for the first time since 2019. The Nashville Predators played SC Bern at PostFinance Arena in Bern, Switzerland, on October 3, 2022.

The regular season began on October 7, 2022, and ended April 14, 2023. Sixteen NHL games were played on the same day for the first time on April 8, 2023.

The one against Columbus was rescheduled to January 17, and the one against Colorado was rescheduled to April 14 (the day after the regular season was originally scheduled to end). Due to a severe winter storm, two December 23 games were postponed. The Detroit Red Wings–Ottawa Senators game was rescheduled to February 27.

The team with home ice advantage plays at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team is at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top three teams in each division make the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference, for a total of eight teams from each conference. In the First Round, the lower seeded wild card in each conference played against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card played against the other division winner, and both wild cards were de facto #4 seeds. The other series matched the second and third place teams from the divisions. In the first two rounds, home ice advantage was awarded to the team with the better seed. In the Conference Finals and Stanley Cup Finals, home ice advantage was awarded to the team with the better regular season record.

The San Jose Sharks unveiled new uniforms which were mainly inspired by the team's original 1991 to 1998 set. These uniforms will also feature teal pants, gloves, and home helmets. The Vancouver Canucks unveiled a modernized version of their 1990s black/red/yellow "Flying Skate" uniforms as their new alternate jersey. The Vegas Golden Knights promoted their gold alternate jerseys to primary home jersey, as part of their "Golden Age" campaign. Each NHL team wore "Reverse Retro" jerseys for select games during the 2020–21 season, utilizing a variety of uniform designs and color schemes from the teams' histories. After several months of speculation, the NHL formally announced the return of the "Reverse Retro" program for the 2022–23 season on October 19, 2022, with new designs. All 32 jerseys were formally revealed the next day on October 20, with all containing a vintage-styled orange and black NHL shield logo. The jerseys for the 2023 NHL All-Star Game, revealed in late January 2023, were also revealed to be part of the program.

This was the ninth season of the league's 12-year Canadian national broadcast rights deal with Sportsnet. This included Sportnet's sub-licensing agreements airing Saturday Hockey Night in Canada games on CBC Television and French-language broadcasts on TVA Sports. Sportsnet has discontinued the Hometown Hockey format for its Monday-night national games and replaced it with Rogers Monday Night Hockey. The schedule included two special Friday editions of Hockey Night in Canada on January 13 and 27, and the Hockey Day in Canada games on January 21. NHL Live, the digital streaming package for both national and out-of-market games, was discontinued. Out-of-market games were now streamed exclusively on Sportsnet Now Premium, albeit with reduced functionality with no home/away or radio broadcast features available. This followed the league's trend of moving out-of-market streaming rights directly onto a media partner's platform, after the previous season when ESPN+ took over the U.S. rights from the league's in-house NHL.tv. Hometown Hockey co-host Tara Slone left Sportsnet entirely after the format was discontinued. The Winnipeg Jets hired Dan Robertson as the team's new TV play-by-play announcer, replacing Dennis Beyak. TSN analyst Mike Johnson replaced Ray Ferraro as a color commentator of the network's Toronto Maple Leafs broadcasts. Ferraro departed TSN to focus primarily on his duties as the lead color commentator on ESPN and ABC's NHL broadcasts in the United States. This was the second season of the league's seven-year U.S. national broadcast rights deals with the ESPN family of networks and Warner Bros Discovery Sports (formerly Turner Sports). ESPN aired exclusive regular season games on selected Tuesdays, Thursdays, and weekends. ABC continued to air games on selected Saturdays during the second half of the season. ESPN+ and Hulu exclusively streamed games throughout the season, primarily on most Tuesdays, Thursdays, and weekends. The All-Star Game and the Stadium Series was broadcast by ABC, while the All-Star skills competition aired on ESPN. NHL content on ESPN+, including out-of-market games, was rebranded under the blanket title "NHL Power Play on ESPN+". ESPN also collaborated with Disney Channel on a youth-oriented alternate broadcast of the Washington Capitals–New York Rangers game on March 14, 2023, using the player and puck tracking system to render a live, 3D animated version of the game portrayed by characters from its animated series Big City Greens. WBD aired regular season games primarily on TNT, with TBS, truTV, and HLN being used as overflow. TNT primarily aired national games on Wednesday nights, along with the Thanksgiving Showdown, Winter Classic, and selected Sunday games during the later half of the season. Unlike the previous season, not all of TNT's games were exclusive broadcasts, and were thus subject to blackout. NHL Network continues to nationally televise selected regular season games not broadcast by either ESPN or TNT. The network also produces its own game broadcasts on Saturday and Sunday afternoons as part of the NHL Network Showcase series. In September 2022, Ted Leonsis's Monumental Sports & Entertainment bought out NBCUniversal's ownership stake in NBC Sports Washington, which carries broadcasts of the Washington Capitals and the NBA's Washington Wizards, both Monumental-owned teams. Monumental initially took minority ownership of the network in 2016. NBC will provide transitional corporate, technical, and distribution support up to 18 months after the sale, and Monumental plans to rebrand the network after the 2022–23 season. On February 24, 2023, the AT&T SportsNet regional sports networks sent letters to the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Vegas Golden Knights saying they had until March 31, 2023, to reach an agreement to take their local television rights back. Warner Bros. Discovery, the owners of the networks, intends to leave the regional sports networks business. If a deal is not reached the networks will file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The Seattle Kraken's deal with Root Sports Northwest is not affected because Warner Bros. Discovery only has minority control of that network. On March 14, Diamond Sports Group, the operator of the Bally Sports regional sports networks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Diamond plans to continue to broadcast games for the 12 NHL teams it has regional rights to while it plans to separate from majority parent Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of the reorganization. The Seattle Kraken hired Eddie Olczyk as a TV color commentator, joining John Forslund and J. T. Brown on a three-person booth for a majority of games. Olczyk will continue to hold the same position with TNT on a concurrent basis. The New Jersey Devils hired Bill Spaulding as the team's new TV play-by-play announcer, replacing Steve Cangialosi.
