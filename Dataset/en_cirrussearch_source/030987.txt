The Mieses Opening is a chess opening that begins with the move: 1. d3 The opening is named after the German-British grandmaster Jacques Mieses. It is considered an irregular opening, so it is classified under the A00 code in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves. White's 1.d3 releases their c1-bishop and makes a modest claim for the centre, but since it does not stake out as large a share of the centre as 1.d4 does, it is not a popular opening move. Of the twenty possible first moves for White, it ranks tenth in popularity. Nevertheless, since 1...d6 is playable by Black against any opening move from White, the corresponding move is playable by White as well. Its ability to transpose into a King's Indian Attack setup is also important to consider. Black has many reasonable responses, such as 1...e5, 1...d5, 1...c5, 1...Nf6, and 1...g6. The most famous use of this opening was in the third game in the Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov match in 1997. Kasparov believed that the computer would play the opening poorly if it had to rely on its own skills rather than on its opening book. The game was drawn. It had been previously used by David Levy in a 1984 prize match against Cray Blitz, which Levy won.
