Oliver Baumann (born 2 June 1990) is a German professional footballer who currently plays as a goalkeeper for and captains Bundesliga club TSG Hoffenheim. Oliver Baumann joined SC Freiburg's youth team in 2002, since then he has gone on to make 104 Bundesliga appearances for the club. He went on to make 21 appearances for SC Freiburg. On the last day of the 2009–10 Bundesliga season, Baumann made his senior team debut in a 3–1 home victory over Borussia Dortmund. He became the SC Freiburg first-choice goalkeeper from the 2010–11 season onwards, where he made 30 appearances in the Bundesliga.[citation needed] In June 2011, he extended his contract until 2015. In the following two seasons, 2011–12 and 2012–13, Baumann made a total of 73 appearances for the Freiburg first-team, 67 of those in the league. In the 2013–14 season he continued to be the mainstay of the Freiburg line-up, starting all of the club's first six Bundesliga fixtures, as well as starting Freiburg's opening UEFA Europa League and DFB-Pokal matches. In a match against Hamburg SV, Baumann made three terrible bloopers that led to a 3–0 loss to Hamburg SV. Despite his terrible performance, he started the following game against Nürnberg and kept a clean sheet to help Freiburg achieve its first win of the 2013/14 season. On 24 September 2013, Baumann signed a new contract at the club. On 14 May 2014, Baumann joined TSG Hoffenheim on a four-year contract deal. Baumann is yet to make his senior team debut for Germany, but has made at least one appearance for all of the nation's youth sides from Under-18 level to Under-21 level.[citation needed] He made his one and only Germany U-18 appearance in a 2–3 friendly defeat to the Republic of Ireland in the under-18 side. All four of Baumann's Under-19 appearances came in friendlies, most notable was a 5–0 home win against the Estonia U-19 side.[citation needed] After then making two appearances for Germany's U-20 side against the Switzerland Under-20s and Italy Under-20s, he made the step up to Under-21 level. For the 2010–11 season, Baumann made four Germany U-21 friendly appearances, conceding six goals during those matches.[citation needed] Since that season, he has made just five Under-21 appearances in three seasons.[citation needed] Baumann was called up to the senior Germany squad for the UEFA Nations League matches against Spain and Switzerland in September 2020.
