She tracks down Jacob, the son of the shoemaker Heinz and the grocer Hanna, and invites him into her castle. When Jacob refuses to aid the witch in her plan, the witch transforms him into an ugly hunchbacked dwarf with a long nose. The witch is convinced that Jacob will be unable to withstand the social rejection and return to her. Jacob finds that seven years have passed during his time in the castle; Heinz died of grief in Jacob's absence, and Hanna is unable to recognize Jacob upon his return. At the same time, the King's daughter Princess Greta is turned into a goose by the witch after she discovers her in her father's library stealing a spell which will help her rule the kingdom. Jacob and Greta meet and plan to overthrow the witch and get back to their families and true forms.
