Hyperion is a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) in California that is the world's tallest known living tree, measuring 115.92 m (380.3 ft). Hyperion was discovered on August 25, 2006, by naturalists Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor. The tree was verified as standing 115.55 m (379.1 ft) tall by Stephen Sillett. It was found in a remote area of Redwood National Park that was part of the original 1968 park boundaries. The park also houses the second, fourth and fifth tallest known trees, coast redwoods named Helios, Icarus, and Daedalus, currently 377, 371 and 363 feet, respectively. Hyperion was measured as 116.07 metres (380.8 ft) tall in 2019. Hyperion is estimated to be 600 to 800 years old and contain 530 m3 (18,600 cu ft) of wood. The exact location of Hyperion is nominally secret but is available via internet search. However, In July 2022, the Redwood Park superintendent closed the entire area around the tree, citing "devastation of the habitat surrounding Hyperion" caused by visitors, and now anyone who gets too close could face up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Researchers have said that woodpecker activity at the top may have prevented the tree from growing taller. In February 2012, Hyperion was featured in the BBC Radio 4 documentary, James and the Giant Redwoods, by James Aldred.
