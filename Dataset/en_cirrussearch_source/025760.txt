Akure is a city in south-western Nigeria. It is the capital and largest city of Ondo State. The city had a population of 403,000 as of the 2006 population census. Its current population is 774,000. Rock engravings prior to the Mesolithic period, have been discovered on the outskirts of Akure. Also the oldest Homo sapiens fossil ever found in West Africa thus far was discovered there, dating back to around 11,000 years ago. The Akure Kingdom is regarded as one of the sixteen ancient Ekiti kingdoms. According to oral history, a person by the name of Alakure founded Akure, but Omoremilekun Asodeboyede (a descendant of Oduduwa) actually established the present dynasty of monarchs and the modern Akure Kingdom.a. The Prince left Ile-Ife, where Oduduwa ruled, in search of a place to settle after passing a strict test administered by Oduduwa himself, and eventually founded the city upon his arrival in the Akure region and his conquering of the Alakure. Asodeboyede represents the wave of princely descendants from Ile-Ife who ousted the indigenous rulers of the region. The Oba's Palace is located at the centre of the town, and was built in 1150 AD. It has over 16 courtyards (ùà), with each having its unique purpose. Ùà Lílá (big courtyard, which serves as the town hall), Ùà Ùbúra (courtyard for swearing oaths), Ùà Jẹ́mifọhùn, Ùà Ùkómọ (courtyard for naming ceremonies), Ùà Ògògà (courtyard of the Ògògà), Ùà Oriole (courtyard for sacred religious oaths taken by chiefs and the king), Ùà Ojukoto (where religious ceremonies are held), Ùà Agbeto (courtyard where babalawo and priests of Ifa meet to offer prayers and council), Ùà Ameshe (where criminals were punished), are some of the names of the courtyards. At present, a bigger and more modern palace is being built to the south of the old palace's grounds. Oja Oba, which means the Oba's Market, is just a stone's throw away from the Palace. Akure's King is known as the Deji of Akure and is supported by six (6) high chiefs (Iwarefa) in his or her domain. The totem of Akure is the Leopard. Omoremilekun (Asodeboyede), the first king of Akure, was himself called Ekun, meaning "Leopard" (this was his regnal name). It is for this reason that every descendant of the Akure clan has been addressed by outsiders as Omo Ekun during the recitation of his or her praise poetry or, alternatively, as 'Omo Akure Oloyemekun', since Omoremilekun was said to have stayed for a while at Igbo Ooye ascending to the region that would become his kingdom.
