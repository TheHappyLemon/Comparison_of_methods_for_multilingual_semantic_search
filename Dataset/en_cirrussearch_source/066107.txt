The Gilgit River (Urdu: دریائے گلگت) is a tributary of the Indus River, flowing through various districts of Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan region, including Gupis-Yasin, Ghizer and Gilgit districts. The Gilgit River originates from Shandur Lake and proceeds to join the Indus River near the towns of Juglot and Bunji. This confluence is believed to mark the meeting point of three prominent mountain ranges: the Hindu Kush, the Himalaya, and the Karakoram ranges.. The upper sections of the Gilgit River are referred to as the Gupis River and Ghizer River. Shandur Pass isbn:1483603792 - Cerca con Google (in Italian). Handy, Norman (2017).
