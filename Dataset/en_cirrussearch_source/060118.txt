The Rarytkin Range (Russian: хребет Рарыткин; Chukot: Ръарыткын) is a range of mountains in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russian Far East. Administratively the range is part of Anadyr District. The Rarytkin Range is the northernmost subrange of the Koryak Highlands, East Siberian Mountains. It stretches roughly from southeast to northwest in southern Chukotka, along the left bank of the Velikaya River in its middle and lower course. To the northwest flows the Anadyr River and the range acts as an eastern boundary of the Anadyr Lowlands. The highest mountain of the Rarytkin Range is 1,085 metres (3,560 ft) high Mount Palets (гора Палец). It rises in the central area of the range. Lake Krasnoye is located at the feet of the northwestern part of the range. Rare fossil plants of the Maastrichtian and Eocene periods have been found in the range. Some of them are now kept in the Botanical Museum of the Russian Academy of Sciences. There are shrub thickets of Japanese stone pine and alder in the lower mountain slopes. The upper elevations are covered with mountain tundra. The Rarytkin Range has a subarctic climate, somewhat moderated by the proximity of the ocean. Michael C. Boulter, Helen Fisher eds.
