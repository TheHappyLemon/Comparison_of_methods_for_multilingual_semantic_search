The 1974 NHL Amateur Draft was the 12th NHL Entry Draft. It was held via conference call at the NHL office in Montreal, Quebec. In an effort to prevent the WHA from poaching players, the draft was conducted early and in secret. This failed to prevent tampering as information leaked out via agents and other sources over the three days of the draft. As a statement of frustration at the slow, secretive conference call format, Buffalo General Manager Punch Imlach claimed "Taro Tsujimoto" of the "Tokyo Katanas" of Japan using the 183rd overall pick. NHL officials immediately validated the selection, but weeks later Imlach admitted that Tsujimoto was a fabrication. The selection was ruled invalid by the NHL and removed from their records. This also marked the first year the NHL allowed underage players to be signed, a move made in response to the WHA's similar practice the previous year. The last active player in the NHL from this draft class was Mark Howe, who retired after the 1994–95 season. Below are listed the selections in the 1974 NHL amateur draft. The Vancouver Canucks' first-round pick went to the Montreal Canadiens as the result of a trade on May 15, 1973 that sent Montreal's first-round pick (Bob Dailey) in 1973 NHL Amateur Draft to Vancouver in exchange for this pick. The St. Louis Blues' first-round pick went to the Montreal Canadiens as the result of a trade on March 9, 1974 that sent Dave Gardner to St. Louis in exchange for this pick.

The Asia / Japan selection was later invalidated, once Buffalo Sabres General Manager Punch Imlach admitted that "Taro Tsujimoto" of Japan, a low selection (eleventh round, 183rd overall), was a fabrication in answer to his frustration over the format of the 1974 draft. 1974–75 NHL season 1974 NHL Expansion Draft 1974 WHA Amateur Draft List of NHL players 2005 NHL Official Guide & Record Book ISBN 0-920445-91-8 "TSN Rewind: TSN Original – The Man Who Never Was" (video).
