The House of Pahlen (German: von der Pahlen; Russian: Пален, Palen) is an old German, Estonian, Russian, Lithuanian, Swedish and Baltic German noble family of Pomeranian origin. The family probably originated from Pomerania, but in the beginning of the 15th century moved to Livonia. The first historical account of this family dates to 1290, when Johannes de Pala was Vogt at Turaida. On 18 September 1679, Charles XI of Sweden granted a barony to five brothers of the family and all their descendants. In 1799, Emperor Paul I of Russia gave Peter Ludwig von der Pahlen and all of his descendants the rank of count. By a decision of the Russian Empire in 1755 and 1865, most of the other members of the Pahlen family received the Russian baronial rank. Members of the branches with Russian baronial titles also live in Sweden, and they form part of the unintroduced nobility.
