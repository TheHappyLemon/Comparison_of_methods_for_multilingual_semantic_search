In opting to continue his development in the CHL, Hájek was selected second overall in the 2015 CHL Import Draft by the Saskatoon Blades of the WHL. At the completion of his second season with the Blades, Hájek was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning on 21 March 2017.

On 13 November 2020, Hájek was loaned to HC Kometa Brno of the Czech Extraliga (ELH). On 7 September 2021, the Rangers re-signed Hájek to a one-year contract. On 12 July 2022, he was signed to a one-year contract extension. He spent most of the 2022–23 season with the Rangers but was assigned to Hartford on 10 February 2023.
