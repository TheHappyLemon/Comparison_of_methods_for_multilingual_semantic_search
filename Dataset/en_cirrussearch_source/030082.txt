Chamaebatia, also known as mountain misery, is a genus of two species of aromatic evergreen shrubs endemic to California. Its English common name derives from early settlers' experience with the plant's dense tangle and sticky, strong-smelling resin. They are actinorhizal, non-legumes capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiosis with the actinobacterium, Frankia. Chamaebatia comprises the following species: Chamaebatia australis (Brandegee) Abrams – Southern mountain misery Chamaebatia foliolosa Benth. – Sierra mountain misery, bearclover, kit-kit-dizze The status of the following species is unresolved: Chamaebatia foliolosa Newb.
