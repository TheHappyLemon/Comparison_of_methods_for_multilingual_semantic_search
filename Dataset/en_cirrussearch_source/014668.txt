Goshenite is a colorless gem variety of beryl. It is called the mother of all gemstones because it can be transformed into other like emerald, morganite, or bixbite. Goshenite is also referred to as the purest form of beryl since there are generally no other elements present in the stone. The gem is used as imitation for diamond or emerald by adding colored foil on it. Goshenite is named after Goshen, Massachusetts, United States, where it was first found. It is also known as white beryl or lucid beryl. Goshenite is not popular in the jewelry industry because of its lack of color and it lacks brilliance, luster, or fire. It is also inexpensive due to the fact it is abundant. Although the gem value of goshenite is relatively low, it can be colored yellow, green, pink, blue, and in intermediate colors by irradiating it with gamma rays and bombarding it with neutrons from nuclear reactors and radioactive materials. The resulting color depends on the content of Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Fe, and Co impurities. It is most commonly found inside granite. It can also be found in metamorphic rocks. Goshenite can be found in countries like China, Canada, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Pakistan, the United States, and Madagascar. "Goshenite". mindat.org. Retrieved 2021-09-22.
