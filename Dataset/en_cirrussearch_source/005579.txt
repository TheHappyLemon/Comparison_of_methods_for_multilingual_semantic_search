.fm is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Federated States of Micronesia, an independent island nation located in the Pacific Ocean. Except for reserved names like .com.fm, .net.fm, .org.fm and others, any person in the world can register a .fm domain for a fee, much of the income from which goes to the government and people of the islands. The domain name is popular (and thus economically valuable) for FM radio stations and streaming audio websites (other similar ccTLDs are .am, .tv, .cd, .dj and .mu); a notable example is Last.fm, a social music website. On March 29, 2018, .fm began allowing registration of emoji domains. Aside from Micronesians and the audio streaming industry, the ccTLD is also used by companies such as: Ask.fm, website through which people ask and answer questions alienradio.fm, website used to promote Coldplay's 2021 album Music of the Spheres DI.FM, internet radio broadcaster consisting of over 90 channels dedicated exclusively to electronic music Dice.fm, UK based ticketing website Fastmail, email hosting company based in Australia Last.fm, website that allows users to track their music listening history Libre.fm, social music platform based on free software Overcast.fm, iOS podcast listening software Relay.fm, an online podcasting network run by Myke Hurley and Stephen Hackett Tastebuds.fm, dating website for music fans thefuture.fm, website providing a platform for DJs to distribute their mixes, and a source for internet radio Moniker Domain Discount24 Key-Systems Gandi.net Name.com 101 Domain EasySpace Idotz.net INWX Hexonet Marcaria (company) EnCirca Safenames Ascio Lexsynergy Internet in the Federated States of Micronesia Internet in the United States .us Roig, Jon.
