Aleksandrs Basovs (born 24 October 1977) is a Latvian football coach. Since January 2020, he has been the head coach of the Latvian U-21 football team. He was born in Riga. Aleksandrs Basovs started his first football training at the Riga Football School. At the age of 15, he made his debut in the 1993 Latvian Higher League season as part of FK Pārdaugava against FK Auseklis, coming on as a substitute in the 88th minute. It was the only game at the highest level as a player, as a cruciate ligament rupture ended his football career. Until then, he was also a candidate for the U-17 and U-19 national team. After prematurely ending his playing career, he started working as a youth coach in Latvia and Russia. In 2015, he returned to Latvia at the invitation of the Latvian Football Federation to lead the Latvian youth national team. "FK Auseklis - FK Pārdaugava 1993 Latvian Higher League". LFF.lv. LFF.
