Křivoklát Castle (Czech: hrad Křivoklát) is a castle in Křivoklát in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It is protected as a national cultural monument. Křivoklát was founded in the 12th century, belonging to the kings of Bohemia. During the reign of Otakar II of Bohemia a large, monumental royal castle was built, later rebuilt by King Wenceslaus IV and later enlarged by King Vladislaus II. The castle was damaged by fire several times. It was turned into a harsh prison and the building slowly deteriorated. During the 19th century, the Fürstenberg family became the owners of the castle and had it reconstructed after a fire in 1826. The Fürstenberg family owned the castle until 1929. Today the castle serves as a museum, tourist destination and place for theatrical exhibitions. Collections of hunting weapons, Gothic paintings and books are stored there.
