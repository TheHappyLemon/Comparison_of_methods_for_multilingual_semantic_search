The Atwood machine (or Atwood's machine) was invented in 1784 by the English mathematician George Atwood as a laboratory experiment to verify the mechanical laws of motion with constant acceleration. Atwood's machine is a common classroom demonstration used to illustrate principles of classical mechanics. The ideal Atwood machine consists of two objects of mass m1 and m2, connected by an inextensible massless string over an ideal massless pulley. Both masses experience uniform acceleration. When m1 = m2, the machine is in neutral equilibrium regardless of the position of the weights. An equation for the acceleration can be derived by analyzing forces. Assuming a massless, inextensible string and an ideal massless pulley, the only forces to consider are: tension force (T), and the weight of the two masses (W1 and W2). To find an acceleration, consider the forces affecting each individual mass. Using Newton's second law (with a sign convention of m1>m2{\displaystyle m_{1}>m_{2}}) derive a system of equations for the acceleration (a). As a sign convention, assume that a is positive when downward for m1{\displaystyle m_{1}} and upward for m2{\displaystyle m_{2}}. Weight of m1{\displaystyle m_{1}} and m2{\displaystyle m_{2}} is simply W1=m1g{\displaystyle W_{1}=m_{1}g} and W2=m2g{\displaystyle W_{2}=m_{2}g} respectively. Forces affecting m1: m1g−T=m1a{\displaystyle m_{1}g-T=m_{1}a} Forces affecting m2: T−m2g=m2a{\displaystyle T-m_{2}g=m_{2}a} and adding the two previous equations yields m1g−m2g=m1a+m2a,{\displaystyle m_{1}g-m_{2}g=m_{1}a+m_{2}a,} and the concluding formula for acceleration a=gm1−m2m1+m2{\displaystyle a=g{\frac {m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}} The Atwood machine is sometimes used to illustrate the Lagrangian method of deriving equations of motion. It can be useful to know an equation for the tension in the string. To evaluate tension, substitute the equation for acceleration in either of the two force equations. a=gm1−m2m1+m2{\displaystyle a=g{m_{1}-m_{2} \over m_{1}+m_{2}}} For example, substituting into m1a=m1g−T{\displaystyle m_{1}a=m_{1}g-T}, results in T=2gm1m2m1+m2=2g1/m1+1/m2=mhg{\displaystyle T={2gm_{1}m_{2} \over m_{1}+m_{2}}={2g \over 1/m_{1}+1/m_{2}}=m_{h}\,g} where mh=2m1m2m1+m2{\displaystyle m_{h}={\frac {2m_{1}m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}} is the harmonic mean of the two masses. The numerical value of mh{\displaystyle m_{h}} is closer to the smaller of the two masses. For very small mass differences between m1 and m2, the rotational inertia I of the pulley of radius r cannot be neglected. The angular acceleration of the pulley is given by the no-slip condition: α=ar,{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {a}{r}},} where α{\displaystyle \alpha } is the angular acceleration. The net torque is then: τnet=(T1−T2)r−τfriction=Iα{\displaystyle \tau _{\mathrm {net} }=\left(T_{1}-T_{2}\right)r-\tau _{\mathrm {friction} }=I\alpha } Combining with Newton's second law for the hanging masses, and solving for T1, T2, and a, we get: Acceleration: a=g(m1−m2)−τfrictionrm1+m2+Ir2{\displaystyle a={{g(m_{1}-m_{2})-{\tau _{\mathrm {friction} } \over r}} \over {m_{1}+m_{2}+{{I} \over {r^{2}}}}}} Tension in string segment nearest m1: T1=m1g(2m2+Ir2+τfrictionrg)m1+m2+Ir2{\displaystyle T_{1}={{m_{1}g\left(2m_{2}+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}+{\frac {\tau _{\mathrm {friction} }}{rg}}\right)} \over {m_{1}+m_{2}+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}}}} Tension in string segment nearest m2: T2=m2g(2m1+Ir2+τfrictionrg)m1+m2+Ir2{\displaystyle T_{2}={{m_{2}g\left(2m_{1}+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}+{\frac {\tau _{\mathrm {friction} }}{rg}}\right)} \over {m_{1}+m_{2}+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}}}} Should bearing friction be negligible (but not the inertia of the pulley nor the traction of the string on the pulley rim), these equations simplify as the following results: Acceleration: a=g(m1−m2)m1+m2+Ir2{\displaystyle a={{g\left(m_{1}-m_{2}\right)} \over {m_{1}+m_{2}+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}}}} Tension in string segment nearest m1: T1=m1g(2m2+Ir2)m1+m2+Ir2{\displaystyle T_{1}={{m_{1}g\left(2m_{2}+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}\right)} \over {m_{1}+m_{2}+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}}}} Tension in string segment nearest m2: T2=m2g(2m1+Ir2)m1+m2+Ir2{\displaystyle T_{2}={{m_{2}g\left(2m_{1}+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}\right)} \over {m_{1}+m_{2}+{\frac {I}{r^{2}}}}}} Atwood's original illustrations show the main pulley's axle resting on the rims of another four wheels, to minimize friction forces from the bearings. Many historical implementations of the machine follow this design. An elevator with a counterbalance approximates an ideal Atwood machine and thereby relieves the driving motor from the load of holding the elevator cab — it has to overcome only weight difference and inertia of the two masses. The same principle is used for funicular railways with two connected railway cars on inclined tracks, and for the elevators on the Eiffel Tower which counterbalance each other. Ski lifts are another example, where the gondolas move on a closed (continuous) pulley system up and down the mountain. The ski lift is similar to the counter-weighted elevator, but with a constraining force provided by the cable in the vertical dimension thereby achieving work in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Boat lifts are another type of counter-weighted elevator system approximating an Atwood machine. Frictionless plane Kater's pendulum Spherical cow Swinging Atwood's machine Tipler, Paul A. (1991).
