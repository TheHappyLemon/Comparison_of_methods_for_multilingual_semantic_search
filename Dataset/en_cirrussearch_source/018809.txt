Paraná Clube, commonly referred to as Paraná, is a Brazilian professional club based in Curitiba, Paraná founded on 19 December 1989. It competes in the Campeonato Paranaense Série Prata, the second tier of the Paraná state football league. Established on December 19, 1989, in the Vila Capanema district, it is one of several Brazilian clubs called Tricolor da Vila ("tricolored of the town") by its fans because it has three team colors. Paraná's three colors are red, white and blue. Apart from football, other sports sponsored at the club are bowling, futsal, martial arts, tennis, volleyball and weight-lifting. On December 19, 1989, Paraná Clube was founded by the merger of EC Pinheiros (three times winner of the state championship (1967 as Savóia FC Água Verde, 1984, 1987)), and Colorado EC (winner of one state championship (1980)). Rubens Minelli was hired as the club's first manager, and Emerson de Andrade was chosen as the director of football. The club's first match was played on February 4, 1990, when Coritiba beat Paraná 1–0 at the Estádio Couto Pereira. In 1991, two years after the club's foundation, Paraná won its first state championship. Later, Paraná would win five state championships in a row, from 1993 to 1997. In 1992, the club won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série B, gaining the right to compete in the following year's Série A. After 8 years, Paraná Clube won another national championship. In 2000, Paraná beat AD São Caetano to win the Yellow Module of the João Havelange Cup. This cup replaced the Campeonato Brasileiro (all levels), which had been suspended for one year. In 2003, Paraná Clube and L.A. Sports, which is a sports marketing company, started a partnership to help Paraná Clube keep its youth academy, and sign new players. In 2005, Paraná Clube created an investment fund to replace L.A. Sports, and, because of this, the partnership was not renewed. On April 9, 2006, Paraná Clube won the Paraná State League for the 7th time after beating ADAP of Campo Mourão 3–0 in the Maringá and drawing 1–1 at Pinheirão Stadium. The attendance of the final match was 25,306 supporters. Paraná Clube's stadium is the Estádio Durival Britto e Silva, also known as the Vila Capanema. It underwent a modernization in 2006, when more than 60 skyboxes were built, as well as new bathrooms and snack bars. The capacity of the "new" Vila Capanema rose to 20,083 spectators, and the inaugural match was held on September 20, 2006 when Paraná beat Fortaleza 2–0 in the Campeonato Brasileiro.[citation needed] In 2007, Paraná played its first Copa Libertadores de América match. In the first stage, Paraná eliminated Cobreloa from Chile, winning the first leg 2–0 in Calama and drawing 1–1 in Curitiba. In the group stage, composed by Parana Clube, Flamengo, Union Maracaibo and Real Potosi, the club finished in second place. Paraná was eliminated in the Round of 16 by Libertad, of Paraguay. After 10 years in the second division, Paraná gained access to the first division of the Brazilian Championship, defeating CRB 1-0 for the 37th round of Serie B 2017.
