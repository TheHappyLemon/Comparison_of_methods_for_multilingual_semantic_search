Nõmme (Estonian for 'heath') is one of the eight administrative districts (Estonian: linnaosa) of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. It has a population of 39,422 (As of 1 January 2019[update]) and covers an area of 28 km2 (11 sq mi), population density is 1,407.9/km2 (3,647/sq mi). The district is largely a middle-class suburban area, mostly consisting of listed private homes from the 1920s and 1930s and is sometimes referred to as the "Forest Town." Nõmme was founded by Nikolai von Glehn, the owner of Jälgimäe Manor, in 1873 as a summerhouse district. The development started around the railway station. In 1926 it was granted town rights, but in the beginning of the Soviet occupation in 1940, it was merged with Tallinn and remains as one of the eight districts of Tallinn to date. There are many historical sights in Nõmme, such as Glehn Castle, the sculpture Kalevipoeg (also known as "Glehn's Devil"), the Victoria Palace cinema, and Nõmme Market. Other important sights include Vanaka Hill, the ski jumping tower, Rahumäe cemetery, and Pääsküla Bog. Nõmme is divided into 10 subdistricts (Estonian: asum): Hiiu, Kivimäe, Laagri, Liiva, Männiku, Nõmme, Pääsküla, Rahumäe, Raudalu, and Vana-Mustamäe. There are six stations in Nõmme on the western route of Elron: Rahumäe, Nõmme, Hiiu, Kivimäe, Pääsküla, and Laagri.
