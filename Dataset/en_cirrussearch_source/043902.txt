B36 Tórshavn (Faroese: Bóltfelagið 1936 Tórshavn) is a Faroese professional football club based in the capital of Tórshavn, playing in the Faroe Islands Premier League, the top tier of Faroese football. B36 Tórshavn has always played its home games in Gundadalur. Today B36 Tórshavn is among the most successful football clubs in the Faroe Islands, having won the Faroe Islands Premier League 11 times, the Faroese Cup 6 times and the Faroese Super Cup once. The club also has a women's section, which is currently in the process of rebuilding. B36 Tórshavn is one of the biggest football clubs in the Faroe Islands, and is known for playing technical and positive football. B36 Tórshavn was officially founded on 28 March 1936, but had already been playing matches since 1935. The capital was growing, and there was a lot of interest in football. B36 was founded by young people who wanted to play football, but had no opportunity to play for the existing club, HB Tórshavn. The initiative was taken by an entrepreneur called Niels Ejdesgaard, who became the first chairman of the new football club. When B36 was founded, they battled with local rivals for the rights to the Gundadalur Stadium, although both teams used the venue and played a number of derby matches there during that initial season. The conflict was solved by the mayor of Tórshavn, who decided that the stadium was to be shared equally between the two clubs. In 1946 the club were celebrated as national champions for the first time, and in 1965 the club won its first national cup. In 1962, B36 Tórshavn celebrated its fifth national championship, but dark times were to follow. The club would wait 35 years for its next national championship. To make matters worse, rival team HB Tórshavn experienced a lot of success in the same period. In the middle of the 1980s, B36 Tórshavn was relegated twice from the best division. Then in 1987, Kristian á Neystabø took over as chairman and Kjartan Mohr as cashier. They took on the task of rebuilding the club, and succeeded in making a turnaround. The results improved, and the cup was won in 1991, although the National Championship was lost in the final match that same year. Then, in 1997, the club celebrated its first national championship in 35 years. Since then, B36 Tórshavn has been five-time champions, and have won the cup three times. In the last 20–25 years, the local rivalry with HB Tórshavn has increased, and now the two clubs are about equal in strength. In 2018, the teams fought a fierce cup final, which B36 Tórshavn won on penalties, after one of the most dramatic cup finals ever at The Faroe Islands. After two red cards in the end of the match, B36 Tórshavn was playing 9 against 11 from the stoppage time in the ordinary match and through all the extended time. In the 95th minute, B36 Tórshavn equalized to 2–2 with the last shot in the ordinary match from the youngster Hannes Agnarson, and went on to keep HB Tórshavn from scoring. This 9 against 11 was a repetition of the previous years 2nd leg of the cup semi finals, where B36 Tórshavn also played with 9 men in all the extended time and about 20 minutes of the ordinary time. Despite being down with 2 men, B36 Tórshavn won the match 3–2, when club legend Róaldur Jacobsen scored from 72 meters in the last minute. Normally Faroese players who move abroad to play football are youngsters who join foreign clubs as academy players, but recently B36 Tórshavn has sold two senior players to norwegian football teams. In 2018 the Faroese international defender Odmar Færø was sold to Hamarkameratene, where he played one season. He then returned to Faroese league to play for KÍ Klaksvík. Likewise, the former Faroe Islands national under-21 football team player Meinhard Olsen was sold to Kristiansund BK in 2018. After a short spell with B36 in 2020 he again went abroad, and is now playing with Mjøndalen IF Fotball in Norway. In June 2019, he made his debut on the Faroe Islands national football team in a match against Spain. In 2022 Martin Agnarsson was sold to the danish Superliga team Viborg FF, after the teams had met in UEFA Europa Conference League. Martin is currently a regular player on Faroe Islands national under-21 football team. In november 2022 he had his debut on the Faroe Islands national football team in a friendly against Kosovo. B36 Tórshavn regularly delivers players to Faroese National Team. Most recently, Andrass Johansen, Hannes Agnarsson, Jann Benjaminsen and Magnus Egilsson were called up for the matches against Liechtenstein and Denmark. A current player on The Faroese U21 National Team is Gutti Dahl Olsen. Last year Taufee Skandari made his debut for Afghanistan.
