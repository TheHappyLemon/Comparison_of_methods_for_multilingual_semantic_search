The Radziwiłł Chronicle, also known as the Königsberg Chronicle, is a collection of Old East Slavic illuminated manuscripts from the 15th-century; it is believed to be a copy of a 13th-century original. Its name is derived from the Radziwiłł family of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (later, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), who kept it in their Nesvizh Castle in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Radziwiłł manuscript was taken out of Königsberg in 1761 and acquired by the Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg, where it is currently being preserved with registration number "34.5.30". The work is a Rus' chronicle which tells the history of Kievan Rus' and its neighbors from the fifth to the early 13th centuries in pictorial form, representing events described in the manuscript with more than 600 colour illustrations.[citation needed] Among East Slavic chronicles, the Radziwiłł is distinguished for the richness and quantity of its illustrations, which may derive from the 13th-century original.[citation needed] The chronicle includes the Tale of Bygone Years and extends it with yearly entries until 1206.[citation needed] Novgorod Slavs building Novgorod Saint Andrew's prophecy of the rise of Kiev Igor of Kiev levying tribute from the Drevlians Academic Chronicle Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible Tolochko 2016.
