Soyuz MS-24 is a Russian crewed Soyuz spaceflight launched from Baikonur on 15 September 2023 to the International Space Station. They were originally assigned to Soyuz MS-23 mission, but they were moved to MS-24 due to a coolant leak on Soyuz MS-22 that required MS-23 to be launched uncrewed as its replacement. Oleg Kononenko is assigned for a one year long mission with his MS-24 crewmate Nikolai Chub that started on September 15, 2023. If the mission lasts 300-365 days, Kononenko will have spent a total of 1,036-1,101 days in space, exceeding the current record of 878 days by Gennady Padalka. He will thus also become the first person to stay 1,000 days in space.
