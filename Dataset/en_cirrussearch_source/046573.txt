The phrase per mille (from Latin per mīlle 'in each thousand') indicates parts per thousand. The associated symbol is ‰, similar to a per cent sign % but with an extra zero in the divisor. Major dictionaries do not agree on the spelling, giving other options of per mil, per mill, permil, permill, permille. The word promille is the cognate in Dutch, German, Finnish and Swedish, and is sometimes seen as a loanword in English with the same meaning as per mille. The code point for the glyph is included in the General Punctuation block of Unicode characters: U+2030 ‰ PER MILLE SIGN. It may be typed using Alt+0137, Compose%o, Ctrl+⇧ Shift+u 2030, or ⌥ Option+⇧ Shift+r according to operating system. Promille and permille are likely best known as shorthand terms for Blood Alcohol Concentration, where 1 promille corresponds to 1 gram of alcohol per liter of blood.

Property taxation rates may be expressed as the millage rate (U.S.) or mill rate (Canada), from mill (currency), one thousandth of a dollar.
