Varakļāni Palace (Latvian: Varakļānu muižas pils) is a palace in Varakļāni, Varakļāni Municipality in the historical region of Latgale, in Latvia. After the end of the Livonian War in 1583, von der Borch [de] family acquired the Vark castle district, it was called "Vark land" (German: Warkland , Warkelen). The palace was designed by the Italian architect Vincenzo Macotti at the request of the estate owner, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth diplomat Count Michał Jan Borch. Construction started in 1783 and completed in 1789. After the death of Count Borch in 1810, his wife, Eleonor Christine (1766-1844), and later their son, Karol Borch (1798-1861), whose daughter Maria married Paweł Roman Sanguszko [pl] (1834–1876), operated the palace. After his death, the manor was inherited by their daughter, Teresa Sanguszko-Kowelska (1864-1954), who married Leon Paweł Sapieha [pl] (1856-1893).
