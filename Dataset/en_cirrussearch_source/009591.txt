Qualifying for all events took place at the Bank of England Sports Ground, Roehampton. The grass was of the Perennial Ryegrass type and cut to 8mm. The 2011 championships were the 125th to be held since 1877, excluding the years 1915–1918 and 1940–1945, when the event was not held due to the two world wars. To mark the occasion a number of special events and activities occurred. Blue Peter broadcast a special programme looking at the championships, past, present and future, which was screened on the second Monday of the tournament. Four 30-minute documentaries charting the history of the championships were commissioned. A new exhibition known as the queue was held in the All England Club's Museum celebrating the people who queue each year for tickets to the championship. In addition, a range of licensed merchandise featuring the "125" logo was released; the ball boy and ball girl uniforms had this logo. The shoes provided by Fila had the words "125 years" and the logo printed on them. The balls provided by Slazenger also had "125 years" stamped onto them, and a special can design was used. Lanson champagne, which is served on the grounds, had "125 years" stamped on the bottle. Finally, to celebrate the anniversary there was a community art project in which participants were asked to "interpret" an unstrung wooden tennis racket "in a medium of their choosing". HSBC held a series of polls on the Wimbledon website to find the 10 greatest things about the championships. The polls consisted of anything from greatest character to best final. In addition the bank also teamed up with the Sports Technology Institute at Loughborough University; to predict how tennis would develop over the next 25 years up to 2036; the 150th Wimbledon and 100 years since Fred Perry, the last British male winner of the championships, won.
