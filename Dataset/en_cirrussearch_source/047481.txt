Kyoko Hamaguchi (浜口 京子, Hamaguchi Kyōko, born January 11, 1978 in Taito, Tokyo) is a Japanese freestyle wrestler. She has won five FILA Wrestling World Championships and two Olympic Bronze medals in the 72 kg weight class. She is sponsored by Japan Beverage Inc. and was nominated by the Japanese Olympic Committee's Special Athlete Campaign. Her father is professional wrestler Animal Hamaguchi, who is known for his emotional displays during Kyoko's matches. Although Kyoko has long wanted to follow in her father's footsteps and enter the professional game, the lack of a stable women's circuit since the collapse of All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling has kept her from doing so.[citation needed] She swam while in junior high school. At the age of fourteen, she decided that she wanted to be a female professional wrestler and trained in the Animal Hamaguchi's Wrestling Dojo. She won the Japan Championship every year from 1996 to 2006, and won the World Championships five times. In both the 2004 Athens Olympics and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, she won a bronze medal in the 72 kg class. She was also a flag bearer for the Japanese team in the opening Olympic ceremonies in 2004. 1996 - win - Japan Championship (70 kg) 1997 - win - Japan Championship (70 kg) 1997 - win - World Championship (75 kg) 1998 - win - Japan Championship (75 kg) 1998 - win - World Championship (75 kg) 1998 - FILA's female wrestler of the year 1999 - win - Japan Championship (75 kg) 1999 - win - World Championship (75 kg) 2000 - win - Japan Championship (75 kg) 2001 - win - Japan Championship (75 kg) 2001 - win - East Asia Competition 2002 - win - Japan Championship (72 kg) 2002 - win - World Championship (72 kg) 2002 - win - Asian Games at Busan (72 kg) 2003 - win - Japan Championship (72 kg) 2003 - win - World Championship (72 kg) 2004 - 2nd - Testing Competition for Athens Olympics (72 kg) 2004 - 3rd - Athens Olympics (72 kg) 2004 - win - Japan Championship (72 kg) 2005 - 2nd - World Championship (72 kg) 2005 - win - Japan Championship (72 kg) (winning for 10 years), MVP (天皇杯 (Ten'noh-hai)) 2006 - win - Japan Queen's Cup (72 kg) 2006 - 2nd - World Cup (72 kg) 2006 - 2nd - Asian Games (72 kg) 2007 - 2nd - Asia Championship (72 kg) 2008 - 2nd - Asia Championship (72 kg) 2008 - 3rd - Beijing Olympics (72 kg) Tokyo Sports Wrestling Special Award (1998, 1999, 2002-2006) "東京スポーツ プロレス大賞：選考経過（1990～1999）".
