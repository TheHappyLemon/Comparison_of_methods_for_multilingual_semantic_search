It co-stars Zhang Xiaofei, Shen Teng, and Chen He. It is the first film directed by Jia Ling; a semi-autobiographical fantasy story about a young woman who is suddenly thrown back in time to the year 1981, where she meets her mother and develops a bond of sisterhood with her. The film's themes include familial love, maternal love, and filial piety. It was released on 12 February 2021 (Chinese New Year). The film has grossed US$848 million at the box office, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 2021, the third-highest-grossing non-English film of all time, and the highest-grossing film by a solo female director until Barbie in 2023. The film received positive reviews, with word of mouth contributing to its popularity.In addition, the film also won the honor of excellent film at the 36th China Popular Film Awards, and won the award for excellent feature film at the 19th China Huabiao Awards. After her mother Li Huanying is fatally injured in a car accident in 2001, grief-stricken Jia Xiaoling finds herself transported back in time to the year 1981, where she becomes her mother's close friend. Jia Xiaoling feels that she has not been a good enough daughter in the present, so back in 1981, she does all she can to make Li Huanying happy, including setting her up with a factory manager's son, Shen Guanglin, in the hope of giving her mother a better husband, a better daughter, and a better life than she had the first time around. Jia Ling as Jia Xiaoling Zhang Xiaofei as Li Huanying Liu Jia as Li Huanying (middle-aged) Shen Teng as Shen Guanglin Chen He as Leng Te He He as Bao Yumei Ding Jiali as Bao Yumei (middle-aged) Bao Wenjing as Zhao Yanhua Han Yunyun as Wang Qin Wang Lin as Wang Qin (middle-aged) Xu Juncong as Xu Zhikai Qiao Shan as Jia Wentian Jia Wentian as Jia Wentian (middle-aged) Hi, Mom is Jia Ling's directorial debut. She spent more than three years writing the script with her co-writers, and production started on 25 September 2019. It was filmed on location at factories in Jia Ling's hometown of Xiangyang, Hubei. The film is adapted from Jia Ling's 2016 comedy sketch of the same name, "Hello, Li Huanying", from season 1 of Comedy General Mobilization [zh]. It is also based on stories of Jia Ling's own mother, also named Li Huanying, who died in 2001 shortly after Jia started college. Jia made the film as a tribute to her mother. The film's Chinese title literally means "Hello, Li Huanying" rather than "Hi, Mom". When asked about this difference, Jia Ling said that a mother is not just a mother, but her own person too. On September 25, 2019, Jia Ling published a post announcing the launch of the movie Hi, Mom. On January 7, 2020, the film was announced.

On 6 March, its gross reached 5.04 billion RMB, surpassing 2019's Nezha to become the second-highest-grossing film of all time in China.
