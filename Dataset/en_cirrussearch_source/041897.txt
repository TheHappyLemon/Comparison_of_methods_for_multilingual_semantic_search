Fragaria viridis, commonly called creamy strawberry or green strawberry is a species of strawberry native to Europe and central Asia. It has fruits with fine flavour. They have surprisingly little of the usual strawberry aroma, but a refreshing acidity, and sometimes ripen without becoming red. When they are plucked from the plant, the calyx will usually adhere and they will detach with a noticeable snapping sound. All strawberries have a base haploid count of 7 chromosomes. Fragaria viridis is diploid, having 2 pairs of these chromosomes for a total of 14 chromosomes. Fragaria viridis is approximately 6,24 million years old.
