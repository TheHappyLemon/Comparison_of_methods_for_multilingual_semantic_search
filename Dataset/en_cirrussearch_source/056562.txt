Cidlina (Czech pronunciation: [ˈtsɪdlɪna]) is a river in the Czech Republic, a right tributary of the Elbe River. It flows mainly through the Hradec Králové and Central Bohemian regions. It is 87.3 km (54.2 mi) long. According to one theory, the name of the river is of Celtic origin and was composed of the words sīd(o) (meaning 'calm' or 'peace') and lèana (meaning 'wet meadow'). According to another theory, the name comes from the Proto-Slavic adjective cědlá, which meant 'clear', 'clean'. The Cidlina originates in the territory of Lomnice nad Popelkou in the Ještěd–Kozákov Ridge at the elevation of 563 m (1,847 ft) and flows to Libice nad Cidlinou, where it enters the Elbe River at the elevation of 186 m (610 ft). About 1.5 km south of the main spring there is the secondary spring of the Cidlina. The river is 225.9 km (140.4 mi) long. Its drainage basin has an area of 1,164.5 km2 (449.6 sq mi). The longest tributaries of the Cidlina are: The most notable settlement on the river is the town of Jičín. The river flows through the municipal territories of Železnice, Jičín, Vitiněves, Slatiny, Žeretice, Vysoké Veselí, Smidary, Skřivany, Nový Bydžov, Mlékosrby, Chlumec nad Cidlinou, Olešnice, Žiželice, Choťovice, Žehuň, Dobšice, Sány, Opolany and Libice nad Cidlinou. The largest body of water on the Cidlina and in its whole basin area is the Žehuňský Pond with an area of 173 ha (430 acres). There are 126 bodies of water larger than 1 ha in the basin area. On the upper reaches of the river there is an extensive nature monument called Javorka a Cidlina – Sběř. It has an area of 272.9 ha (674 acres) and, in addition to the Cidlina bed, it also covers the bed of the lower course of the Javorka and some areas on the banks of the Cidlina. The reason for the protection is to ensure a stable population of specially protected species of plants and animals, especially the thick shelled river mussel, the dusky large blue, the Eurasian otter and the green snaketail. The area of Žehuňský Pond and its surroundings is protected as Žehuňský rybník National Nature Monument. It has an area of 301.6 ha (745 acres). Endangered species found here include the narrow-mouthed whorl snail and several rare species of the genus Taraxacum (bavaricum, pauckertianum and irrigatum). The secondary spring of the Cidlina is located in Jezírko pod Táborem Nature Monument on an area of 0.3 ha (0.7 acres). It is a small peat pond with a population of the round-leaved sundew. The Cidlina is suitable for river tourism. About 76 km (47 mi) of the river is navigable. Its calm flow makes it suitable for beginner paddlers.
