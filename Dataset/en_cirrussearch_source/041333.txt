Daryl Impey (born 6 December 1984) is a South African former professional road cyclist, who competed as a professional from 2008 to 2023. Impey is an all-rounder; he generally comes to the fore on tough uphill sprints. Impey is a two-time winner of the Tour Down Under, and the only rider to have won the race in consecutive years, winning in 2018, and 2019. He has won the South African National Road Race Championships twice, and is a nine-time winner of the South African National Time Trial Championships, including eight consecutive titles between 2013 and 2020. In 2013, Impey became the first African rider to wear the yellow jersey at the Tour de France, doing so for two days; six years later, he won his first individual stage at the race, winning the ninth stage in Brioude. After riding for the South African team Barloworld in 2008 and 2009, in 2010 Impey joined Team RadioShack. Impey had originally signed for 2011 with the Australian team called Pegasus, but was forced to seek employment elsewhere after that team failed to secure a UCI license. After riding for MTN–Qhubeka and Team NetApp in 2011, Impey joined GreenEDGE for the squad's inaugural season in 2012. He won a stage of the Tour of the Basque Country in April of that year, before making his Grand Tour debut at the Giro d'Italia in May. In 2013, he became the first South African ever to lead the Tour de France. He won the Tour of Alberta in 2014 by a single second thanks to his victory in the last stage, which gave him enough bonus seconds to overtake Tom Dumoulin. Impey confirmed his good form a couple of days later by taking the fourth place on the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec. In 2015, Impey had to abandon the Tour de France after being involved in a massive crash on the third stage. He was named in the start list for the 2015 Vuelta a España. In August 2020, it was announced that Impey was to join Israel Start-Up Nation from the 2021 season – alongside his former Barloworld teammate Chris Froome – on a two-year contract. 2003 1st Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships 2004 National Under-23 Road Championships 1st Time trial 2nd Road race 1st Stage 5 Giro del Capo 6th Overall Tour de Tunisie 2006 African Road Championships 3rd Time trial 4th Road race 2007 1st Road race, All-Africa Games Giro del Capo 1st Points classification 1st Prologue & Stage 2 1st Stage 10 Tour du Maroc 2008 1st Stage 6 Herald Sun Tour 6th Memorial Viviana Manservisi 9th World's View Challenge 1 9th World's View Challenge 2 2009 1st Overall Tour of Turkey 1st Points classification 1st Stage 4 2nd Road race, National Road Championships 3rd Giro del Capo II 7th Giro del Capo IV 2011 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 2nd Overall Tour du Maroc 1st Stage 7 3rd Overall Tour of South Africa 9th Overall Tour of Azerbaijan (Iran) 2012 1st Stage 2 Tour of the Basque Country 1st Stage 2 Tour of Slovenia 2013 1st Time trial, National Road Championships Tour de France 1st Stage 4 (TTT) Held after Stages 6–7 1st Stage 2 Tour of the Basque Country 1st Stage 2 Bayern–Rundfahrt 2nd Team time trial, UCI Road World Championships 5th Overall Eneco Tour 5th Vuelta a La Rioja 2014 National Road Championships 1st Time trial 2nd Road race 1st Overall Tour of Alberta 1st Stage 5 4th Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec 7th Overall Bayern–Rundfahrt 1st Stage 3 7th Overall Tour Down Under 2015 National Road Championships 1st Time trial 2nd Road race 2nd Vuelta a La Rioja 3rd 947 Cycle Challenge 6th Overall Tour des Fjords 6th Classic Sud-Ardèche 7th Overall Tour Down Under 1st Sprints classification 2016 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 3rd Team time trial, UCI Road World Championships 2017 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st 947 Cycle Challenge 1st Stage 6 Volta a Catalunya 2018 National Road Championships 1st Road race 1st Time trial 1st Overall Tour Down Under Critérium du Dauphiné 1st Points classification 1st Stage 1 3rd Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race 8th GP Industria & Artigianato di Larciano 10th Brabantse Pijl 2019 National Road Championships 1st Road race 1st Time trial 1st Overall Tour Down Under 1st Stage 4 1st Overall Czech Cycling Tour 1st Points classification 1st Stage 1 (TTT) 1st Stage 9 Tour de France 3rd Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race 2020 National Road Championships 1st Time trial 2nd Road race 3rd Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race 6th Overall Tour Down Under 2021 2nd La Drôme Classic 2022 1st Stage 4 Tour de Suisse 2nd Road race, Commonwealth Games Puddicombe, Stephen (21 July 2016).
