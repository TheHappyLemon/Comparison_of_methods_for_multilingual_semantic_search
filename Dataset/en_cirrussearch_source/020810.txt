Ng Ser Miang was born in 1949 in Swatow, China; his family moved to Singapore the same year. He studied at the Serangoon Garden Government High School (now Serangoon Garden Secondary School and Dunman Government High School (now Dunman High School). While in high school, Ng was a Boy Scout troop leader and head prefect. During this time he also travelled to the United States for nine months with an American Field Service scholarship. While in the US Ng first developed an interest in sailing and learned the sport. After high school, Ng studied business administration at the University of Singapore (now the National University of Singapore) and graduated in 1971 with honours. While at university, in 1969, Ng won a silver medal at the Southeast Asian Peninsular Games as a part of the Singapore sailing team. Following his graduation, he completed his national service. In 1973, Ng entered the business world, working as a bank officer at the Chung Khiaw Bank. Three years later, he became the managing director of Singapore Shuttle Bus, a City Shuttle Service operator. To create competition for the Singapore Bus Service, the only bus service in Singapore at the time, Ng started the Trans-Island Bus Services (TIBS) in 1982 and acted as the company's managing director. As a result of his work with TIBS and Singapore Shuttle Bus, Ng was named Singapore's Outstanding Manager of the Year in 1993. In 2001, TIBS was purchased by SMRT Corporation and later rebranded SMRT Buses. Ng retired from the company after overseeing the sale.

While serving as the SSC chairman, Ng helped launch the Sports for Life programme to promote sports for Singaporeans of all ages, and the Sports Excellence programme which directed national resources to supporting athletes in competitive sports. During Ng's tenure, the Singaporean government spent Singapore $500 million in supporting the different programmes.

In 2005, after being the first Asian elected to the International Olympic Committee Executive Board, Ng served as President of the 117th IOC Session Organising Committee which took place in Singapore.
