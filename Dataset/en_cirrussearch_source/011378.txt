The Long Road is the fourth studio album by Canadian rock band Nickelback, released on September 23, 2003. Recorded at the famed Greenhouse Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, it is the band's final album with Ryan Vikedal as drummer, and features a notable change in style towards more aggressive guitar riffs and the inclusion of double bass drumming. The album is the first collaboration with producer Joey Moi; who engineered their previous album Silver Side Up and would produce the band's next three albums. Most of the album's songs were an experiment from the band into writing heavier downtuned riffs in either B or C tuning. On tracks such as "Flat on the Floor", "Because of You", and "Throw Yourself Away"; Vikedal implemented the use of double bass drumming. Despite this; the album features several prominent acoustic segments on songs such as "Someday", "Believe it or Not", and "Should've Listened". Kroeger's lyrics often revolved around topics ranging from breakups, self-harm, sex, and personal motivation. Kroeger wrote the lyrics to "Throw Yourself Away" about Melissa Drexler's infamous 1997 infanticide at her high school prom. During the band's appearance at Bizarre Festival in Weeze, Germany, on August 16, 2002; "Figured You Out" made its first live appearance. "Someday" later made an appearance as a part of Nickelback's appearance on MTV Unplugged in London on September 3, 2003. The album debuted at #6 on the Billboard 200 in the United States, it managed to sell 200,000 copies in its first week of release. The album was quickly certified platinum by the RIAA on October 24, 2003; eventually being certified double-platinum on March 6, 2004. The album was later certified 3× Platinum in the United States on March 10, 2005; having sold 3,591,000 copies as of April 2011. It has sold over 5 million copies worldwide and was the sixth bestselling album of 2003, having also sold over 2 million copies internationally. It was later ranked #157 on Billboard's 200 Albums of the Decade. The album received polarizing reviews from critics, journalists often praised the heavier musical direction and aggressive guitar riffs, but criticized the album's misogynistic lyrics. The album was nominated for Rock Album of the Year at the 2004 Grammy Awards. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly praised the album for its musical compositions, lauding the angrier direction and Vikedal's strong drumming on numerous tracks, claiming "The band hammers each song home with a single-minded fervor, cannily melding metal, grunge, and melody. As a singer, Kroeger possesses that rarest of latter-day rock-star commodities: an instantly identifiable voice imbued with passion and edge". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album a modest review, criticizing Kroeger's songwriting but also praising the production of the album in addition to the band's darker change in musical direction, claiming "Nickelback courts it through their audience-pleasing grunge pastiche, which treats the style as just another variation of hard rock". The band embarked on tour in support of the album with Trapt and Three Days Grace hired as opening acts. Theory of a Deadman were later hired as an opening act in November 2003 replacing Trapt. The tour included 45 North American dates, 25 European dates, 3 Japanese dates, and 5 Australian dates, the second longest tour to date from the band. Prior to the second European leg, opening acts Theory of a Deadman and Three Days Grace were replaced by 3 Doors Down and Puddle of Mudd. Following the tour, on January 2, 2005, Nickelback unexpectedly fired Vikedal after a minor royalty disagreement, replacing him with 3 Doors Down drummer Daniel Adair. Kroeger later sued Vikedal to prevent him receiving any further royalties from the band's music, though the matter was later settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. The bonus track of the band's cover of Elton John's 1973 song "Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting" was featured on the soundtrack to the movie Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle in 2003, with a guest verse from Kid Rock and a guitar solo from Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell. The song "Learn The Hard Way" was featured on Daredevil: The Album in 2003. The song "Slow Motion" was featured on The Punisher: The Album in 2004. The song "Flat on the Floor" was featured in the video games MLB 2005 in 2004 and FlatOut 2 in 2006; the song "Believe It or Not" was also featured in the latter. The song "See You at the Show" was featured on the album Harley-Davidson: Ride in 2005. In Australia, it was also used on the Nine Network's Friday night Australian Football League coverage in 2005. The song "Because of You" was featured in the video games MX vs. ATV Unleashed in 2005 and Guitar Hero World Tour in 2008. The song "Figured You Out" was featured as downloadable content for the video game Rock Band in 2010. The song "Someday" was later included in 2011. The song "Should’ve Listened" was covered by country singer Travis Tritt on his 2007 album The Storm.. Credits adapted from album's liner notes.
