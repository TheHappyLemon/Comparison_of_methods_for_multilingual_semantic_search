Taxi 2 (French: Taxi Deux) is a 2000 French action comedy film directed by Gérard Krawczyk and released in March 2000. Starring Samy Naceri, Frédéric Diefenthal and Marion Cotillard. It is the second installment in the Taxi film series. It is a sequel to Taxi, written by Luc Besson and directed by Gérard Pirès in 1999. It was followed by Taxi 3 in January 2003. A video game adaptation was released on the Game Boy Color by Ubisoft, also in 2000. A Japanese minister of defence is traveling to Paris to sign a weapons contract between Japan and France, but first, he is visiting Marseille to view and rate the city police's anti gang tactics (using fake attacks on him). During the visit, however, he is kidnapped by a group working for the Japanese yakuza. Emilien (Frédéric Diefenthal) is determined to rescue the minister and detective Petra (Emma Sjöberg), his girlfriend who was also kidnapped, and restore the honour of his department. Once again, speed demon taxi driver Daniel (Samy Naceri) is called upon to save the day with his high speed driving skills. Also with the Peugeot, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI is also featured as a star car driven by the yakuza.

Lead of ARP and Besson's friend Pétin grit his teeth, as he had carried the first project, but he agreed. The director of the first film Gérard Pirès was replaced by Gérard Krawczyk, who detractors say was more controllable, but who responded back stating he did what he wanted without needing to respect the scenarios laid by Besson. On Monday, August 16, 1999, only two weeks into filming, Boulevard de l'Amiral-Bruix was closed to traffic for the length between Porte Dauphine and Porte Maillot. The Peugeot 406 had to come speeding out of the tunnel, head on to the springboard, jump over two AMX-30 tanks and land on a bed of boxes and mattresses. After an unsuccessful first try, the stunt coordinator Rémy Julienne with 35 years of experience and credit of 4000 films including six James Bond Films, decided to increase the incline of the springboard a bit and also up the car's running speed. On the second take, the taxi took off faster and higher, landing a few meters further than expected, hitting the 41-year-old cameraman Alain Dutartre, his assistant and a third person. Dutartre died a few hours later in the hospital. The assistant had both of his legs broken. Besson was in Los Angeles at the time and was contacted immediately. He flew to the set, where detectives were already investigating the matter. Filming had to continue, but did so in a somber mood. In June 2002, Luc Besson was summoned to court. Authorities alleged safety was compromised in an effort to cut costs. The stunt coordinator Rémy Julienne was given a one-year suspended jail sentence, and fined €13,000. Luc Besson, Grenet and director Gerard Krawczyk were initially cleared of charges. But the Paris Court of Appeal reversed the ruling in June 2009, and EuropaCorp was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and ordered to pay €100,000. Julienne's jail sentence was reduced to six months, and his fine was reduced from €13,000 to €2,000, but he was required to pay the Dutartre family €50,000 in court costs. The film set an opening record and had 10.3 million admissions in France (the highest for the year) and 5 million in 37 other countries worldwide. It also had good TV ratings with 10 million viewers on TF1. Neil Smith, reviewing the film for BBC, gave it two stars out of five and writes that it's a "virtual reprise of the 1998 French box-office smash" and while "there's very little of merit in this tongue-in-cheek actioner, it at least delivers the requisite amount of high-octane thrills."
