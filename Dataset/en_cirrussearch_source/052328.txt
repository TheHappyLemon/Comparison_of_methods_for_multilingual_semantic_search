The first Wikipedia related to the Hungarian language was created on 5 September 2001, by Larry Sanger, the English language Wikipedia coordinator at the time. He created the address at http://hu.wikipedia.com/. At that time Wikipedia was still running on UseModWiki. For many months there was little Hungarian content, and there were problems with vandalism. The Hungarian Wikipedia as it is known today was launched by Péter Gervai on 8 July 2003. On this day, the opening page was made available with a Hungarian interface and in Hungarian, at its current address of http://hu.wikipedia.org/. Since its launch it has been growing steadily, moving up in the multilingual ranking from 34th place in 2003 to 18th place in December 2005 and 17th in December 2009, then dropping slightly to 19th place in September 2011. On 31 October 2010, the Hungarian Wikipedia contained 179,894 articles with 8,992,153 edits by 38 administrators, 153,779 registered users as well as many unregistered ones. On 14 January 2013, the Hungarian Wikipedia became the first to enable the provision of interlanguage links via Wikidata. The Hungarian Wikipedia reached the 50,000-article milestone on 7 February 2007, the 100,000th on 17 July 2008, and the 150,000th on 25 December 2009, by which it matched the size of the first complete Hungarian encyclopedia, the Pallas's Great Lexicon. The 200,000-article milestone was reached in September 2011, and it was marked by a new version of the Wikipedia globe showing 200,000 moving onward.
