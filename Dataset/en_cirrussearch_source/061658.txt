Zoran Tošić (Serbian Cyrillic: Зоран Тошић, pronounced [zǒran tǒʃitɕ, - tôː-]; born 28 April 1987) is a Serbian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Greek Super League club Lamia. He has built a reputation as a free-kick specialist and a tricky dribbler. Tošić began his career with his local side Proleter Zrenjanin, before making his debuts with Mladost Lukićevo. He then joined Budućnost Banatski Dvor, who then merged with Proleter to form Banat Zrenjanin. A year later, he signed for Serbian giants Partizan, for whom he played for two years before a high-profile move to Manchester United of England. After he struggled to break into the Red Devils first-team, he was sent on a six-month loan to German side 1. FC Köln in January 2010, and was then transferred to CSKA Moscow of Russia that summer. A full international between 2007 and 2016 , Tošić has earned 76 caps for Serbia. He was part of their teams at the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2010 World Cup. Born in Zrenjanin, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia, Tošić began his football career with Mladost Lukićevo. After he terminated a contract with the club, he stayed without a club to play for a six-month period. He also played futsal with KMF SAS in the meantime. Later he moved to Budućnost Banatski Dvor, before the club merged with Proleter Zrenjanin to form Banat Zrenjanin. In 25 appearances for Banat in the 2006–07 Serbian SuperLiga campaign, Tošić scored two goals, and in doing so helped his team avoid relegation. Tošić's performances both on the domestic scene with Banat and on the international scene with Serbia earned him glances from many clubs across Europe. On 6 August 2007, Tošić signed a four-year professional contract with Partizan. He made his Partizan debut in a 1–0 league win against Vojvodina at Stadion Karađorđe on 11 August, coming on as a 15th-minute substitute for injured Almami Moreira. Tošić was subject to a successful work permit application as the player had not played the required 75% of his team's matches in the previous year. On 28 November, there were reports that Tošić had been granted a work permit, with the transfer expected to go through at the start of the transfer window. Despite claims that negotiations had stalled over Tošić's personal terms, the transfer was finalised on 2 January 2009, with both Tošić and his Partizan teammate Adem Ljajić joining United. Tošić was given the number 14 shirt. Tošić received his first taste of first team football on 20 January 2009, when he was named on the bench for United's League Cup semi-final second leg at home to Derby County. He made his debut in an FA Cup Fourth round match against Tottenham Hotspur on 24 January 2009, when he came on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Cristiano Ronaldo. Tošić's league debut came three days later, on 27 January 2009, when he came on as a 77th-minute substitute for his friend Dimitar Berbatov in United's 5–0 win over West Bromwich Albion. Although he did not make many first team appearances in his first season at Manchester United, Tošić became a regular in the club's reserve team, helping the team to a second-place finish in the Premier Reserve League before scoring the winning goal in the final of the 2009 Manchester Senior Cup against Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium. He scored his first senior goal for the club on 26 July 2009 in an 8–2 victory over Hangzhou Greentown during United's pre-season campaign in Asia. In a Scottish newspaper interview in September 2012, Tošić stated that he regretted walking out on United. On 27 January 2010, Tošić joined 1. FC Köln on loan until the end of the 2009–10 season.
