.mw is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Malawi. After initial delegation, in 2002 the IANA recommended that administration of the ccTLD be transferred to the Malawi Sustainable Development Network Programme from Computer Solutions Ltd. The recommendation was implemented. Prices for .mw domains are US$100 for the first two years, followed by $50 per year thereafter. In addition to registrations directly at the second level, it is also possible to register third-level names beneath these names. For the most part, the descriptions of the types of organizations each domain is for are advisory, and are not enforced. ac.mw – academic institutions co.mw – commercial organisations com.mw – an alternative for commercial organisations coop.mw – cooperative associations edu.mw – degree-granting academic institutions gov.mw – restricted to government int.mw – international treaty organisations museum.mw – museums, historical, documentation or display organisations net.mw – networking organisations org.mw – non-profit organisations IANA .mw whois information .mw domain registration website nic.mw "IANA | Report on Redelegation". www.iana.org.
