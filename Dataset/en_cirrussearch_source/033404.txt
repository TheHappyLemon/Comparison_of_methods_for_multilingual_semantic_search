Kosmos 2516 (Russian: Космос 2516 meaning Space 2516) is a Russian military satellite launched in 2016 as part of the GLONASS satellite navigation system. This satellite is a GLONASS-M satellite, also known as Uragan-M, and is numbered Uragan-M No. 753. Kosmos 2516 was launched from Site 43/4 at Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia. A Soyuz-2-1b carrier rocket with a Fregat upper stage was used to perform the launch which took place at 08:44 UTC on 29 May 2016. The launch successfully placed the satellite into a Medium Earth orbit. It subsequently received its Kosmos designation, and the international designator 2016-032A. The United States Space Command assigned it the Satellite Catalog Number 41554. The satellite is in orbital plane 2, in orbital slot 11. Kosmos 2516 experienced a depressurization event in November 2020, which permanently disabled the satellite after four years in service. GLONASS-K 15 (No. 705), launched on 25 October 2020, was repurposed as its replacement.
