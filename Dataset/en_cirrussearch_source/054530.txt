Macek would play a total of 319 WHL games until 2013, first representing the Tri-City Americans, followed by a stint with the Calgary Hitmen. Following an outstanding 2012–13 season with the Calgary Hitmen, in which he served as an assistant captain and scored 32 goals in 70 games to go along with 48 assists in WHL play, Macek decided to accept an offer from Germany: In June 2013, he inked a two-year deal with the Iserlohn Roosters of the German top-flight Deutsche Eishockey Liga. In 2015, he had his contract renewed for the 2015–16 campaign. After three years with the Roosters and 154 DEL appearances with the team (51 goals, 61 assists) plus 22 playoff contests (nine goals, seven assists), Macek decided to move on.

In 2018, he won a second straight German championship. He tallied 34 goals and 25 assists in 67 games during the 2017-18 campaign. On June 12, 2018, Macek signed a one-year deal (worth an NHL average annual value of $650,000 and an American Hockey League base salary of $175,000) with the Vegas Golden Knights of the NHL. In his first professional season in North America, Macek was assigned by the Golden Knights to American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Chicago Wolves, for the duration of the 2018-19 season. He showed his offensive instincts, earning a top-line role in finishing third in scoring with 26 goals and 34 assists for 60 points in 64 games. He posted 5 goals in 17 playoff games as the Wolves reached the Calder Cup finals. On June 21, 2019, Macek left the Vegas Golden Knights as an impending restricted free agent, agreeing to a one-year contract with Russian club, Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg of the KHL.
