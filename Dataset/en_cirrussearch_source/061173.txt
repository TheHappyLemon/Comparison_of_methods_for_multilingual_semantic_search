In July 2016, he was included in the roster for the 2016 MLS All-Star Game. On 12 December 2017, Ciman was traded to MLS expansion side Los Angeles FC in exchange for Raheem Edwards and Jukka Raitala.

Following the 2020 season, Toronto chose not to renew his contract. Ciman was a member of the Belgium squad which came fourth at the 2008 Olympics.
