Soyuz TMA-17M was a 2015 flight to the International Space Station. It transported three members of the Expedition 44 crew to the International Space Station. TMA-17M was the 126th flight of a Soyuz spacecraft; the first having occurred in 1967. The crew consisted of a Russian commander accompanied by Japanese and American astronauts. The capsule remained docked to the space station for about five months until the scheduled departure of Expedition 45 in December 2015. Soyuz TMA-17M landed safely on the steppes of Kazakhstan on 11 December, 2015, in a rare night landing. The mission patch for the mission is completely based on Apollo 17 insignia.
