Ildikó Mádl (born 5 November 1969 in Tapolca) is a Hungarian chess player who holds the FIDE titles of International Master (IM) and Woman Grandmaster (WGM). Madl learned to play chess from her father. In 1978 she became a pupil of the chess school Mereszjev that helped to promote talented Hungarian children and teenagers. In 1982 and 1983 she won the so-called Olympiad of Pioneers and the Hungarian Championships under-13 and under-15. Moreover, in 1982 she won the Hungarian Girls Championship U20 although she was only 13 years of age. At the Hungarian Women's Championship in 1982 she was third. In 1983 and 1984 she achieved her first international successes. In winter 1983/84 she won an international girl's tournament in Straubing and in 1984 she won the Cadet World Championship for Girls (U16) in Champigny-sur-Marne and the European Junior Chess Championship for girls U20 in Katowice. It was only consequent that Mádl was nominated for the Hungarian national team. Consequently, in her first Women's Chess Olympiad she scored 8 points from 11 games, receiving the title of Woman International Master (WIM). She achieved the required norms for the title of Woman Grandmaster in 1985 at a men's tournament in Szolnok and an international women's tournament in Jajce. In 1986 she could repeat her success at the European Junior Championship which in that year took place in Băile Herculane. In the same year she became World Junior Girls Champion U20 in Vilnius, scoring 2 points ahead of Camilla Baginskaite and Svetlana Prudnikova.

The Hungarians winning the Olympiad 1988 in Thessaloniki was remarkable. For the first time since 1976 the event was not won by the Soviet Union. Mádl played together with the three Polgár sisters (Judit, Zsuzsanna and Zsófia). The gold medal was overshadowed by the tragic loss of her fiancé of that time, Béla Perényi. A few weeks before on the way from Budapest to the Olympiad he was killed in a car crash. During the Olympiad Mádl's coach was the FIDE Master Ottó Magyar. She took part in European Women's Team Championship six times between 1992 and 2007. In 1992, 1999, 2001 and 2005 she played first board, in 2007 third board.
