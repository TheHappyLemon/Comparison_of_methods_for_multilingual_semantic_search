The 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup was the first Confederations Cup to be organized by FIFA. The tournament had previously been played in 1992 and 1995 as the King Fahd Cup. This edition of the tournament was hosted by Saudi Arabia, as with the previous editions, in December 1997 and was the first to feature representatives from all of the FIFA confederations. It was won by Brazil, who, in a rematch of their goalless group stage encounter, beat Australia 6–0 in the final. After winning the 1997 tournament, Brazil became the first country to be the reigning champion of both major FIFA tournaments (the World Cup and the Confederations Cup), as well as champion of their respective confederation by winning the 1997 Copa América. This feat has since been accomplished once by France, victorious in the 1998 World Cup, UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup. 1Germany, the UEFA Euro 1996 winner, declined to participate. Czech Republic, the runners-up, were invited to their place. 2The United Arab Emirates was awarded a spot in the competition because Saudi Arabia had won the 1996 AFC Asian Cup. All matches were played in 67,000-seat King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh.[citation needed] 12 December 1997 16:15 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 80,000 Referee: Nikolai Levnikov (Russia) 12 December 1997 19:00 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 15,000 Referee: Pirom Un-Prasert (Thailand) 14 December 1997 17:50 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 15,000 Referee: Ian McLeod (South Africa) 14 December 1997 20:00 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 15,000 Referee: Lucien Bouchardeau (Niger) 16 December 1997 17:50 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 55,450 Referee: Javier Castrilli (Argentina) 16 December 1997 20:00 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 20,000 Referee: Ian McLeod (South Africa) 13 December 1997 17:50 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 13,000 Referee: Ramesh Ramdhan (Trinidad and Tobago) 13 December 1997 20:00 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 7,500 Referee: Javier Castrilli (Argentina) 15 December 1997 17:50 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 11,000 Referee: René Ortubé (Bolivia) 15 December 1997 20:00 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 9,000 Referee: Saad Mane (Kuwait) 17 December 1997 17:50 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 8,000 Referee: René Ortubé (Bolivia) 17 December 1997 20:00 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 8,000 Referee: Ramesh Ramdhan (Trinidad and Tobago) 19 December 1997 15:15 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 28,000 Referee: Lucien Bouchardeau (Niger) 19 December 1997 19:00 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 22,000 Referee: Nikolai Levnikov (Russia) 21 December 1997 17:50 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 27,000 Referee: Lucien Bouchardeau (Niger) 21 December 1997 21:00 AST King Fahd II Stadium, Riyadh Attendance: 65,000 Referee: Pirom Un-Prasert (Thailand) Source: FIFA Romário received the Golden Shoe award for scoring seven goals.
