Prince Louis of Wales (/ˈluːi/ LOO-ee; Louis Arthur Charles; born 23 April 2018) is a member of the British royal family. He is the third and youngest child of William, Prince of Wales, and Catherine, Princess of Wales. A grandson of Charles III, he is fourth in the line of succession to the British throne. Prince Louis was born on 23 April 2018 in St Mary's Hospital, London, at 11:01 BST (10:01 UTC), during the reign of his paternal great-grandmother Elizabeth II, as the third child and second son of Prince William and Catherine, then known as Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. His birth was marked by gun salutes and bell ringings. On 27 April, his name was announced as Louis Arthur Charles, honouring his paternal grandfather, Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles III), and his 3rd-great-uncle Louis, Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Louis was christened on 9 July by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace. Louis and his family lived at Kensington Palace and Anmer Hall during his early childhood. He made his Trooping the Colour debut in 2019. He started at Willcocks Nursery School near Kensington Palace in April 2021. The family relocated to Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Home Park in 2022, after which he started attending Lambrook, an independent preparatory school in Berkshire, along with his older siblings, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Louis also accompanied his siblings and parents for Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022 and Louis's grandfather became king. Accordingly, Louis became fourth in line to the throne. He accompanied his parents and elder siblings to his grandfather's coronation on 6 May 2023. Louis is a British prince with the official style and title "His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Wales". Before his father was created Prince of Wales on 9 September 2022, Louis was styled "His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge". Louis is fourth in the line of succession to the British throne, behind his father and two elder siblings, George and Charlotte. Following the implementation of the Perth Agreement, which replaced male-preference primogeniture with absolute primogeniture, he is the first British prince to be ranked behind an elder sister in the line of succession.
