For the first time, the flag of Riga was mentioned in 1232 (in the book vexillum civitatis Rigensis), but its color and form are not known. After Riga joining the Hanseatic League in 1282 sources mention that the flag of Riga ships has a white cross, but the shape and color of the flag are not indicated (in the beginning of the 14th century it was known that Riga had a black flag with a white cross). After 1582, the flag of Riga was white with a red coat of arms of the city, while in the middle 17th century, thanks to the city's heroism defending against Muscovite troops, the king of Sweden assigned his royal colors to Riga: a blue flag with a yellow cross, with in the center of the cross two keys were crossed on the red shield. The flag was used until 1860. The blue-white flag of Riga, which was used today, was created in 1673, when it was approved in the statutes of Riga - blue and white bands in rectangular shape, with the coat of arms of Riga in the center. The flag was used along with the flag given by the Swedish king. From the mid-1800s until 1917, a new tricolor flag with equal blue, red and white bands was approved for Riga. Some sources place its origin to the 1830s. During the 1920s the blue-white flag of Riga was restored by 1935, and, with the addition of the coat of arms in the center, officially approved on 4 May 1937. It was flown until the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940. During the era of Soviet Latvia, after having no official city flag, the city authorities hurriedly adopted a red flag in 1970 after the city was awarded the Order of Lenin, with a different obverse and reverse side of the flag. The obverse side of the flag consisted of Lenin's portrait with a laurel branch and the inscription "Workers of the world, unite!" in Latvian. The reverse side of the flag consisted of the coat of arms of the Latvian SSR, and the inscription "Riga City" in both Latvian and Russian. In 1988, during the Singing Revolution, academician Jānis Stradiņš [lv] led a campaign to return to the blue and white design. While the change was accepted on 5 August 1988, the then-communist-dominated city council with its chairman Alfrēds Rubiks in charge amended the coat of arms of the original flag, replacing the crown and cross in the shield with a five-pointed red star and the color of the crossed keys from black to gold. The shade of blue was also made lighter. The original blue-white flag of 1937 was ultimately restored by the city council as the current flag in 20 April 1990.
