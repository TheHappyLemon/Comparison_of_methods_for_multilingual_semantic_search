This article lists the WTA Awards given by the Women's Tennis Association to players and coaches for achievements during a season or their careers. This award is named for the late WTA trailblazer Jerry Diamond and is awarded to the player who gives endlessly to promote the game of tennis on and off the court. Award named for Peachy Kellmeyer, former player and the first tour director of the fledgling Virginia Slims circuit (precursor of WTA Tour). In 2020, the award was presented to all the members of the WTA Players' Council, as the group "worked diligently discussing proposals and obtaining feedback to help the Tour return safely and successfully, all with a dedicated commitment to their fellow players", following the suspension of the tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Award named for Karen Krantzcke, an Australian player who died of a heart attack whilst jogging, aged 31, on 11 April 1977. Currently this award and only one other award, the Peachy Kellmeyer Player Service, are uniquely given after a vote by fellow players. 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Tennis portal ATP Awards ITF World Champions World number 1 ranked female tennis players World number 1 ranked male tennis players Tennis statistics Martina Navratilova, originally from Czechoslovakia, became a U.S. citizen in 1981.
