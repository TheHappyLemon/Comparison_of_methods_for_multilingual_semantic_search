Nikola Milenković (Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Миленковић, pronounced [nǐkola milěːŋkoʋitɕ]; born 12 October 1997) is a Serbian professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Serie A club Fiorentina and the Serbia national team. The quest to begin his career journey began in Žarkovo, where his family lived. Because Nikola grew up in that Belgrade neighbourhood, it was easy for his parents (notably his Mother) to identify a suitable academy he could train with. After having a successful trial, the youngster got enrolled in the academy roaster of OFK Žarkovo. This is a famous professional football academy based in Žarkovo. Nikola laid his career foundation on solid footings in this nice academy. Nikola had an excellent start to his youth career, as he surpassed his teammates in both training and games. OFK Žarkovo’s youth coach (Nikola Jelic) observed Nikola’s attributes and was very eager to discuss the boy’s future. All he wanted was for Nikola to excel fast, and Jelic noticed that his continuous stay with OFK Žarkovo wasn’t the right option. At 15, the youngster had a successful trial with Teleoptik. This bigger and better academy came with a limitation – which is distance. On many occasions, Nikola’s mother got worried about how her son would travel and get to school (on time) and still balance his football obligation. Because of the issue with distance, there came this quest to change Nikola’s academy. Thankfully, word came out that Partizan was looking for kids. This is an elite Serbian football club based in Belgrade. Because of their reputation, it is really hard to pass their academy trials. Nikola Milenković was among 30 other kids who were approved to come for trials with the great club. Only five passed, and Nikola was one of them. Passing the youth categories of Partizan, Milenković was loaned to Teleoptik for the 2015–16 season. At the beginning of 2016, he joined the first team of Partizan under coach Ivan Tomić and signed a five-year contract, but also stayed with Teleoptik on dual registration until the end of season.

During the first few months, Nikola was getting used to his new environment and that's why Viola coach Stefano Pioli didn't often include him in the starting line-up. However, the tragic death of the team captain Davide Astori made Pioli change his mind and include Nikola in the starting eleven more often.
