His long-range passing is particularly noteworthy, and he is capable of playing accurate diagonal balls to switch the play and create space for his teammates. Due to his passing abilities, Akanji has been deployed as both a left back and right back, as well as occasionally a libero, much like teammate John Stones, by City manager Pep Guardiola.

His sister Sarah is a former footballer for FC Winterthur Frauen and Social Democratic Party of Switzerland politician.
