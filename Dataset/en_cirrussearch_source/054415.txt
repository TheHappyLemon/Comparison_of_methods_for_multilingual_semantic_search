Henderson is a city in Clark County, Nevada, United States, about 16 miles (26 km) southeast of downtown Las Vegas. It is the 2nd most populous city in Nevada, after Las Vegas, with an estimated population of 320,189 in 2019. The city is part of the Las Vegas Valley. Henderson occupies the southeastern end of the valley, at an elevation of 1,864 feet (568 m). Henderson is known for its supply of magnesium during World War II. With the decline of magnesium production, the Nevada legislature approved a bill that gave Nevada's Colorado River Commission the authority to purchase the industrial plants, and Henderson was incorporated in 1953. Henderson is the location of Lake Las Vegas. The township of Henderson first emerged in the 1940s during World War II with the building of the Basic Magnesium Plant. Henderson quickly became the main supplier of magnesium in the United States, which was called the "miracle metal" of World War II. The plant supplied the US War Department with magnesium for incendiary munition casings and airplane engines, frames, and other parts. A quarter of all US wartime magnesium came from the Henderson Plant to strengthen aluminum, using 25% of Hoover Dam's power to separate the metal from its ore by electrolysis. Mayor Jim Gibson's grandfather, Fred D. Gibson, was one of the original engineers sent to Great Britain to learn the secret of creating the "miracle metal" which would help the United States and its allies win the war. The British liaison officer sent to Henderson, Major Charles Ball, had a main thoroughfare named after him. Because of concerns about having a street named “Ball Avenue”, the name was later changed to “Major Avenue”.[citation needed] Although "born in America's defense", Henderson's future after World War II was uncertain. In 1947, magnesium production was no longer necessary for defense, and most of the Black Mountain Industrial (BMI) Complex's 14,000 employees moved away. Enrollment in the school system was reduced by two thirds, and well over half the townsite houses, built to house plant workers, became vacant. In 1947, the United States War Asset Administration offered Henderson for sale as war surplus property. In an effort to save the city, the Nevada Legislature spent a weekend visiting Henderson, evaluating the possibility of state administration of Basic Magnesium. Within days of the visit, the legislators unanimously approved a bill that gave Nevada's Colorado River Commission the authority to purchase the industrial plants. Governor Vail Pittman signed the bill on March 27, 1947, helping save Henderson from becoming war surplus property.[citation needed] With the help of local industry, Henderson was incorporated on April 16, 1953, as the City of Henderson. On May 23, 1953, Henderson, with its population of 7,410, elected Dr. Jim French as the first mayor. Originally only about 13 square miles (34 km2) in size, the city quickly began to grow, reaching over 94 square miles (240 km2) in size today.[when?] Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada (PEPCON) was incorporated in Henderson, Nevada, about seven miles southeast of Las Vegas, in November 1955 by Edgar J. Marston (La Jolla, CA), Fred D. Gibson Sr. (Las Vegas, NV), and John V. Mueller (Reno, NV). Initially, PEPCON provided consulting services specializing in mining and chemical plant design. It was also the operator of a chlorine gas packaging plant (servicing area businesses that had swimming pools) and a sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) manufacturing operation using the brand name “Boulder White.” On May 4, 1988, 10:40am the Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada (PEPCON) Ammonium perchlorate manufacture, a crystallized oxygen, in the modern-day Gibson Business Park of Henderson, caught fire.[clarification needed] After complaining of the smell of Mercaptan, an odorant added to natural gas, for 2 weeks prior to the explosion on May 4, 1988. The blaze quickly engulfed the factory, smoke, and flames from the building, eventually obliterating it in a massive explosion, followed by six smaller explosions. Smoke was seen from 100 miles (160 km) away, and two major blasts measured 3.0 and 3.5, respectively, on the Richter magnitude scale at observatories in California and Colorado. These explosions sent shockwaves throughout Henderson and parts of the Las Vegas Valley that shattered glass and damaged buildings. Two people were killed and 372 were injured. Investigators surveying the damage in the surrounding communities estimated the blast as similar to a 1-kiloton air burst nuclear detonation. The full report can be found in the book: A Brief History: Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada – January 14, 2016 ISBN 1-5144-3524-1. The events of the PEPCON spurred new development in Henderson years later, from its historical industrial development to residential and commercial development. There are now no signs of the explosion where it happened. Today, the site consists mostly of office buildings.[citation needed] Henderson is about 16 miles (26 km) southeast of downtown Las Vegas. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 107.7 square miles (279.0 km2), all land. The city is in the Mojave Desert with wildlife and vegetation typical of the Mojave. The mountains that surround Henderson mostly have gentle slopes. The McCullough Range is closest to the city; most of this range is covered by black rocks from a volcanic explosion millions of years ago. These mountains reach an average height of about 3,800 feet (1,200 m). The landscape consists of the desert; the only water in the city is found in washes like Duck Creek.

A mayor and four council members are elected citywide, but no more than one council member are allowed to reside in each ward.

Fire prevention services are provided by the Henderson Fire Department and police services by the Henderson Police Department. In 2013, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it had reached a cooperative settlement agreement with the city of Henderson under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The DOJ received complaints by individuals who are deaf that officers for the city of Henderson did not provide them with qualified sign language interpreters and other auxiliary aids and services when needed for effective communication. One of the complainants was arrested and detained for two days in the Henderson detention facility, while the other was an alleged crime victim. During its investigation into the allegations, the department inquired whether the city of Henderson would be interested in resolving the matter voluntarily. The city expressed its full commitment to ensure compliance with the ADA. Under the settlement, the city of Henderson will pay $35,000 to the complainants. The city agreed to provide sign language interpreters, usually within an hour of a person's request to law enforcement officers. Henderson also agreed to modify its handcuffing policies for people who use sign language or hand writing to communicate, and to adopt other policies consistent with the ADA.
