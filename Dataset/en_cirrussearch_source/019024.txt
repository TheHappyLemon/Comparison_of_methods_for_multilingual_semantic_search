This is a list of Baltic German recipients of the military Order of Lāčplēsis. The list consists of 55 recipients of Baltic German extraction, of whom 52 were Latvian citizens at the time they were awarded the Order of Lāčplēsis. The Order was named after the Latvian epic hero, Lāčplēsis. As a young man, Lāčplēsis kills a bear with his bare hands and thus the order is also known as the Order of the Bearslayer.
