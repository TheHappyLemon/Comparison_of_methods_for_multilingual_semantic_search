Expressway S11 or express road S11 (in Polish droga ekspresowa S11) is a Polish highway which has been planned to run from Kołobrzeg on the Baltic coast through Koszalin, Piła and Poznań to Piekary Śląskie (north of Katowice). Its total planned length is about 556.5 kilometres (346 mi). As of March 2024, several sections serving as bypasses of cities and towns are open to traffic, totalling 120.5 km. A few further sections of the expressway are under construction, but the bulk of it still awaits development. According to the plans, the road should be fully completed by 2030. The sections which were constructed with high priority were those which serve as bypasses of the city of Poznań and several smaller cities and towns along the planned highway route. In June 2012, the fragment between DK92 and the A2 motorway opened to traffic. This stretch of the expressway serves as the western bypass of Poznań and provides faster access to Poznań's airport, as well as diverting most of the traffic away from Poznań's congested city centre. The section which serves as the city's western bypass was completed in 2014. In 2023 the section from Koszalin to Bobolice (47.8 km) as well as the bypass of Olesno (24.8 km) were completed.
