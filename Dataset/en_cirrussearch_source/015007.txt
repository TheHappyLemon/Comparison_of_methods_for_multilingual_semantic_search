The men's BMX racing competition at the 2012 Olympic Games in London took place at the BMX track at the Velopark within the Olympic Park, from 8 to 10 August. Latvia's Māris Štrombergs won the gold medal, successfully defending his victory in 2008, with a time of 37.576 seconds. Sam Willoughby, representing Australia, won silver and Carlos Oquendo from Colombia took the bronze. The riders were seeded into four quarter-finals based on a time trial. Each of the four quarter-finals comprised five runs, using a point-for-place system. The top two riders after three runs advanced to the semi-finals (without having to finish the remaining two rides), in addition the top two remaining riders progressed after the full five runs. The semi-finals consisted of three runs, with the top four in each group advancing to the final. The final was a one-run contest.
