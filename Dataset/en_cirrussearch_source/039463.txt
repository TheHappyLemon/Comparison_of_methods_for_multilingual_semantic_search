Dylan Teuns (born 1 March 1992) is a Belgian professional road racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI ProTeam Israel–Premier Tech. Born in Diest in Flemish Brabant, Teuns is based in Halen in Limburg. He originally joined BMC Racing Team as a stagiaire in 2014 before being announced as part of the team's line-up for the 2015 season. He was named in the start list for the 2016 Vuelta a España and the start list for the 2017 Giro d'Italia. In July 2017, Teuns won the Tour de Wallonie, also winning two stages and the points classification alongside his overall success. Teuns then took overall victory in the Tour de Pologne. The following month, he won the Arctic Race of Norway, again winning two individual stages and the points classification. After four years with the BMC Racing Team, Teuns joined the Bahrain–Merida team for the 2019 season. In July 2019, he was named in the startlist for the 2019 Tour de France. Teuns won stage 6 of the race, outsprinting fellow breakaway rider Giulio Ciccone at the summit finish on La Planche des Belles Filles. During the 2021 Tour de France, Teuns took his second Tour de France stage victory, winning the eighth stage of the race. On the final climb of the day, the Col de la Colombière, Teuns caught up with the solo leader Michael Woods and ultimately dropped him before the top of the ascent. Behind Teuns, Tadej Pogačar had attacked out of the peloton and was chasing down the riders in front of him. Pogačar closed to within 15 seconds of Teuns, but did not risk catching him on the descent on wet roads into Le Grand-Bornand. After competing in the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana and the Volta a Catalunya stage races in the first quarter of the 2022 season, Teuns' focus shifted to the Classics. After taking top-ten finishes at the Tour of Flanders (sixth), the Amstel Gold Race (tenth), and Brabantse Pijl (eighth), Teuns took his first one-day race victory at La Flèche Wallonne. Teuns made his move on the final ascent of the Mur de Huy, and managed to hold off five-time race winner Alejandro Valverde to become the first Belgian to win the race since Philippe Gilbert in 2011. 2009 6th Tour of Flanders Juniores 2010 1st Omloop Het Nieuwsblad Juniores 2012 4th Overall Ronde de l'Isard 2013 1st Stage 1 Triptyque Ardennais 3rd Overall Ronde de l'Isard 5th Liège–Bastogne–Liège Espoirs 9th Memorial Van Coningsloo 2014 1st Stage 5 Tour de l'Avenir 1st Stage 3 Giro della Valle d'Aosta 1st Young rider classification, Tour of Utah 2nd Overall Tour de Bretagne 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 3 2nd Liège–Bastogne–Liège Espoirs 2nd Omloop Het Nieuwsblad Beloften 2nd Piccolo Giro di Lombardia 6th Grand Prix de Wallonie 10th Overall Tour of Britain 2015 1st Stage 3 (TTT) Critérium du Dauphiné 3rd Volta Limburg Classic 4th Overall Tour of Belgium 2016 10th Volta Limburg Classic 2017 (8 pro wins) 1st Overall Arctic Race of Norway 1st Points classification 1st Young rider classification 1st Stages 1 & 4 1st Overall Tour de Wallonie 1st Points classification 1st Stages 3 & 5 1st Overall Tour de Pologne 1st Stage 3 3rd La Flèche Wallonne 6th Grand Prix de Wallonie 8th Grand Prix Pino Cerami 2018 3rd Giro di Lombardia 3rd Giro dell'Emilia 5th Overall Tour de Pologne 6th Overall Paris–Nice 7th Brabantse Pijl 2019 (2) 1st Stage 6 Tour de France 5th Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 5th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 6th Overall Critérium du Dauphiné 1st Stage 2 9th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 10th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía Vuelta a España Held after Stage 6 2020 (1) 5th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 1st Stage 5 (ITT) 5th Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 10th Gent–Wevelgem 2021 (1) 1st Stage 8 Tour de France 4th Overall Deutschland Tour 7th Brabantse Pijl 8th Overall Tour de Pologne 2022 (2) 1st La Flèche Wallonne 1st Stage 1 Tour de Romandie 4th Grand Prix de Wallonie 5th Overall Tour of Britain 6th Tour of Flanders 6th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 8th Brabantse Pijl 10th Amstel Gold Race 2023 2nd Grand Prix de Wallonie 5th Overall Arctic Race of Norway 9th Overall Tour de Suisse 10th Overall Deutschland Tour 2024 8th Tour of Flanders "BMC Racing Team: Dylan Teuns".
