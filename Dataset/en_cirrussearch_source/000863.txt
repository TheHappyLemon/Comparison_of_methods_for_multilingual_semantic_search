The Italy v Serbia match was abandoned after six minutes due to rioting by Serbian fans. The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body awarded the match as a 3–0 forfeit win to Italy. As punishment for the crowd trouble at the abandoned Italy v Serbia match, Serbia was ordered to play its next home match against Northern Ireland behind closed doors, with another one-match crowd ban deferred for a probationary period of two years. Italy received a one-match crowd ban deferred for a probationary period of two years. However the Irish Football Association objected and as a result UEFA decreed that Serbia's game against Northern Ireland would only be allowed to have 200 Northern Irish fans attend it. Serbian fans were not allowed to visit the away game against Estonia. The goal tally takes into account the original result of fixtures that were subsequently forfeited, not the awarded scoreline.
