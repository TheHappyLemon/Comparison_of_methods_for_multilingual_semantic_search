The national flag of Saudi Arabia, also known as the al-Alam, is a green background with Arabic inscription and a sword in white. The inscription is the Islamic creed, or shahada: "There is no deity but God; Muhammad is the Messenger of God". The current design has been used by the government of Saudi Arabia since 15 March 1973. The Arabic inscription on the flag, written in the calligraphic Thuluth script with the current one by Saleh al-Mansouf, is the shahada or Islamic declaration of faith: لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا الله مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ الله lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāh, muḥammadun rasūlu-llāh "There is no god but God; Muhammad is the Messenger of God." The green of the flag represents Islam and the sword stands for the strictness in applying justice. The flag is manufactured with identical obverse and reverse sides, to ensure the shahada reads correctly, from right to left, from either side. The sword also points to the left on both sides, in the direction of the script. The usual color of the flag's green was approximated by Album des pavillons as Pantone 330 C, while the color used on flags at United Nations is approximately Pantone 349. At the 2012 London Olympics, Pantone 355 was used. A construction sheet for the governmental version of the flag of Saudi Arabia Because the shahada is considered holy, the flag is not normally used on T-shirts or other items. Saudi Arabia protested against its inclusion on a planned football to be issued by FIFA, bearing all the flags of the participants of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Saudi officials said that kicking the creed with the foot was completely unacceptable. Similarly, an attempt by the U.S. military to win favour with children of the Khost Province of Afghanistan by distributing footballs adorned with flags, including that of Saudi Arabia, ended in demonstrations. The flag is never lowered to half-mast as a sign of mourning, because lowering it would be considered blasphemous and desecrating. Similarly, the flags of Afghanistan and Iraq are also never at half-mast. The normal flag cannot be hoisted vertically according to Saudi legislation. Special vertical flags are manufactured where both the inscription (the creed) and the emblem (the sword) are rotated, although this is rare, as most Arab countries traditionally do not hoist flags vertically. The precursor states to Saudi Arabia were Nejd and Hejaz. The state flag of Nejd followed today's Saudi flag pattern very closely. The state of Hejaz followed the patterns seen in countries like Palestine and Sudan. Caliphates such as the Rashiduns, the Umayyads and the Abbasids used other flags with only one color. After the Siege of Baghdad in 1258, the primary caliphate became the Mamluk Sultanate. In 1517, the Ottomans invaded Egypt and inherited Hejaz and ruled it until the Arab Revolt (1916–18). From 1902 until 1921 a different Arabic inscription was used. One of the primary opponents to the Saudis was the Emirate of Jabal Shammar of the Al Rashid family in the north of the peninsula, until their defeat in 1921. The Black Standard was one of the flags used by the Rashidun and Abbasid Caliphates The white flag was used by the Umayyad Caliphate and the Fatimids The yellow flag was the royal banner of the Fatimid caliph and the state flag of the Ayyubid Caliphate, which conquered what is now Hejaz This flag was used by the Mamluk Sultanate, which inherited Hejaz from the Ayyubids Flag of the First Saudi State from 1744 to 1818 and flag of the Second Saudi State from 1822 to 1891 and the flag of the Third Saudi State from 1902 to 1913 Flag of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar from 1835 to 1921 This flag was used by the Ottoman Empire and correspondingly by Ottoman Hejaz and Arabia from 1844-1916. The Ottomans captured Hejaz from the Mamluks in 1517.

This flag was also used by the Sharifian Caliphate from 1924 to 1925, before Hejaz merged with Nejd to form a union.

He and the people who followed him, since the 18th century, had used the shahada on their flags. In 1921, Abdulaziz Abdulrahman Al-Saud, leader of the Al Saud and the future founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, added a sword to this flag. The design of the flag was not standardized prior to 15 March 1973 when its use became official. Variants with two swords and/or a white vertical stripe at the hoist were frequently used. By 1938, the flag had basically assumed its present form, except the sword had a different design (with a more curved blade) and it, along with the shahada above, took up more of the flag's space.

The script on the flag is written in the Thuluth script. It is the shahada or Islamic declaration of faith: لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا الله مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ الله lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāh, muhammadun rasūlu-llāh There is no god but God; Muhammad is the Messenger of God Royal Flag of the King of Saudi Arabia.
