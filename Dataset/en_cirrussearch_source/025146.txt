The International Commerce Centre is a 108-storey, 484 m (1,588 ft) supertall skyscraper in West Kowloon, Hong Kong, resting atop the Elements mall and near two MTR Stations(Kowloon and Austin Station). It is the world's 13th tallest by height, 10th tallest by number of floors, and Hong Kong's tallest, as well as the only building in the city with over 100 storeys. The official height is 484 m (1,588 ft), which includes the 6 m (20 ft) tall parapets on the roof. It was the world's 4th tallest building and 3rd in Asia when completed in 2010. The south side of the building faces Victoria Harbour, and directly opposite Hong Kong's second tallest building, the International Finance Centre. MTR Corporation Limited and Sun Hung Kai Properties, Hong Kong's metro operator and largest property developer respectively, were responsible for the development of this skyscraper. Known in development as Union Square Phase 7, its current name was officially announced in 2005. The International Commerce Centre was completed in phases from 2007 to 2010. The tower opened in 2011, with the Ritz-Carlton opening in late March and the observatory in early April. The height had been scaled back from earlier plans due to regulations that did not allow buildings to be taller than the surrounding mountains. The original proposal for this building was called Kowloon Station Phase 7 and it was designed to be 574 m (1,883 ft) tall with 102 floors. It would have risen 162 m (531 ft) over the then-current tallest in Hong Kong, 2 International Finance Centre. The tower was designed by the American architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates (KPF) in association with Wong & Ouyang. It was built by Sanfield, the construction subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai. Construction work was temporarily halted on 13 September 2009, due to an lift shaft accident that killed six workers. The top floor is numbered 118. The number "4" is skipped as it sounds like the word "death" when spoken in Cantonese, and is therefore considered an unlucky number, while floor 13 is skipped due to tetraphobia. Except for level 3, 103 and 113, levels with "3" in the last digit were also skipped, and levels 5, 6, 7, 26, 28, 29 & 105 were skipped as well for unknown reasons. They are currently replaced by levels with letter "M" and "R", which stand for "Mechanical" and "Refuge". Although the levels are missing, they are still shown on the elevator's screen of Sky100 and Skydining 101 while going up and down. 28 floors were skipped: 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29, 33, 34, 43, 44, 53, 54, 63, 64, 73, 74, 83, 84, 93, 94, 104, 105, 114. 18 floors were added: UG, M1-1, M1-2, M1-3, M1-5, R1, R2, M2-1, M2-2, R3, M3-1, M3-2, R4, M4-1, M4-2, M4-3, M5, M6 It takes 60 seconds to reach the world's 14th highest observation deck, Sky100 from the lobby on level 2 with a special lift, along with Elements, and the skyway (behind the main entrance of Sky100) to West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD). The 4 restaurants of Skydining 101, which include Inakaya, Odyssée, The Sky Boss and The Kitin, sit on level 101 at 399 m above sea level. The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong occupies level 3, 8, 9 and the top 17 floors (M4-3 to 118), offering 312 rooms as well as the world's highest bar, fitness center and swimming pool set on the top floor. The office floors are located on level 10 to 99, including a mechanical floor and refuge level; in which, the sky lobbies set on level 48 and 49, and the fitness center "SPACE" on level 20. Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank have become anchor tenants of ICC's offices since 2008. The LED light show set a new Guinness World Records for the “largest light and sound show on a single building” using a total of 50,000 m2 on two facades of the ICC. The Show is designed by the lighting design supervisor, Hirohito Totsune, who already designed the lighting system of the Tokyo Skytree. It creates a theme and story line by using lights and music elements, similar to "A Symphony of Lights" in Victoria Harbour.
