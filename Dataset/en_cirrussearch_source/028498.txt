Ceire Cion (Hebrew: צעירי ציון, "Youth of Zion"), sometimes called the Zionist Party or Ethnic Socialist Party, was a centre-left Jewish political party in Latvia during the inter-war period. It was led by jurist Max Lazerson. The party combined the ideas of Zionism and democratic socialism. One of the party's goals was to create a Jewish state in Palestine. The party won a single seat in the 1920 Constitutional Assembly elections. It retained its seat in the 1922, 1925 and 1928 elections, but missed out on a seat in the 1931 elections by 50 votes. Later in 1931 it merged with the Latvian Organisation of Zionist Socialists to form the Zionist-Socialist Party.
