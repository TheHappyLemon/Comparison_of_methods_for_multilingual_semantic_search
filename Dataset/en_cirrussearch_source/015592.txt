Staburags or Staburadze was an unusual 18-meter (59 ft) high cliff on the bank of the Daugava River in Latvia shaped and formed by lime-rich springs. According to a legend, it was once a girl in mourning who was petrified. Since 1965, the cliff has been submerged at a depth of 6.5 meters (21 ft) due to the construction of the Pļaviņas Hydroelectric Power Station dam. In Andrejs Pumpurs' epic poem Lāčplēsis, Staburadze was the name of a goddess living in a crystal palace beneath the whirlpool at the foot of the cliff. Rozenberga, Māra (July 28, 2015).
