Blackpink (Korean: 블랙핑크; RR: Beullaekpingkeu, stylized in all caps or as BLɅϽKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment and consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. Cited as the "biggest girl group in the world", they are considered the most successful Korean girl group internationally and a leading force in the Korean Wave. They are stylistically associated with the "girl crush" concept in K-pop—exploring themes of self-confidence and female empowerment. Blackpink debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which featured "Whistle" and "Boombayah", their first number-one entries on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the US Billboard World Digital Songs chart, respectively. It was followed by the single album Square Two in November, whose song "Playing with Fire" was the first by a Korean girl group to enter the Billboard Canadian Hot 100. The group expanded their global reach with "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" (2018), which was the first song by a Korean female group to enter the UK Singles Chart and receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its music video was the first by a Korean group to surpass one and two billion views on YouTube, and remains the most-viewed by a Korean group to date. Their music videos for "Kill This Love" (2019) and "How You Like That" (2020) each set records for the most-viewed music video within the first 24 hours of release, with the latter breaking five Guinness World Records. Blackpink is the highest-charting female Korean act on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 13 with "Ice Cream" (2020), and on the US Billboard 200, peaking at number one with Born Pink (2022). Blackpink's studio albums The Album (2020) and Born Pink each broke the record for the best-selling female album of all time in South Korea, becoming the first to surpass one million and two million copies sold, respectively. Born Pink was the first album by a girl group to reach number one on the Billboard 200 since Danity Kane in 2008 and set two Guinness World Records as the first album by a Korean girl group to top the Billboard 200 as well as the UK Albums Chart. The album's lead single "Pink Venom" (2022) was the first song by a Korean group to reach number one on Australia's ARIA Singles Chart and the first by a girl group to reach number one on the Billboard Global 200. Blackpink have broken numerous records throughout their career; their Born Pink World Tour (2022–23) became the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group, and they were the first Asian act to headline Coachella. They have the most-subscribed and most-viewed music artist channel on YouTube, and are the most-followed and most-streamed girl group on Spotify. Blackpink's other accolades include several Golden Disc Awards, Billboard Music Awards, People's Choice Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards, among them the first Group of the Year win by a girl group in the 21st century. They were the first girl group to enter Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia, and were named Time's 2022 Entertainer of the Year. The group has been ranked among the top of the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity list and recognized by former South Korean President Moon Jae-in for spreading K-pop and Korean culture worldwide. Blackpink began forming when YG Entertainment held tryouts worldwide for preteen or teenage recruits to create a new girl group after launching its first major one, 2NE1, in 2009. According to the members, joining the label as trainees was akin to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with Jennie describing the experience as "more strict than school" and Rosé comparing it to The X Factor with dorm rooms. For members who had left their lives outside of South Korea, the pace of training alongside the culture shock was especially difficult. Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as 2011, when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14 that their new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 and feature at least seven members. Since then, numerous news and rumors surfaced surrounding the new girl group's debut being delayed, although there had been no official information. It was only on May 18, 2016, that YG Entertainment confirmed the girl group would debut that July, stating that the members were selected through years of stiff competition. The label later confirmed that Jang Hanna and Moon Sua, who were introduced to the public as potential members of the new girl group, were not included in the lineup. Jennie was the first group member revealed, on June 1, 2016. She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in 2010 after moving back to South Korea from New Zealand. She had been introduced to the public for the first time in 2012 in a photo titled "Who's that girl?" on YG Entertainment's website on April 10. Jennie continued to be promoted as a member of the new girl group through multiple collaborations: she starred in the music video for G-Dragon's "That XX" (2012) from his EP One of a Kind and featured in the songs "Black" (2013), from his album Coup d'Etat, and "Special" (2013), from Lee Hi's album First Love. Lisa was revealed as the new girl group's second member on June 8, 2016. She was the only individual among 4,000 applicants to pass the 2010 YG Entertainment audition in her native country Thailand and became the label's first foreign trainee in 2011. She was first introduced in May 2012 in a video that was posted on YG Entertainment's YouTube channel, titled "Who's that girl???". Lisa also appeared in the music video for Taeyang's "Ringa Linga" in 2013. She became a spokesperson for street-wear brand Nona9on in 2015 and cosmetics brand Moonshot in 2016. Jisoo was revealed as the new group's third member on June 15, 2016. She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in July 2011 and appeared in several advertisements and music videos in her pre-debut years, including the music videos for Epik High's "Spoiler + Happy Ending" (2014) from their album Shoebox and Hi Suhyun's "I'm Different" (2014). Jisoo also made a cameo appearance in 2015 drama The Producers. Rosé was the final member to be revealed, on June 22, 2016. She ranked first among 700 applicants in the 2012 YG Entertainment audition in Australia, after which she signed a trainee contract with the label and moved to Seoul to begin training. She featured in G-Dragon's track "Without You" (2012) from One of a Kind, credited as "? from YG New Girl Group" until her official public introduction. On June 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that the new girl group would have four members instead of the originally planned nine and revealed its official name as Blackpink. According to a label representative, the group's name meant "pretty isn't everything" and symbolized that "they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, but also great talent". Jisoo later disclosed in a press conference that other group names under consideration included Pink Punk, Baby Monster, and Magnum. Blackpink released their first dance practice video on July 6, which garnered much public attention. On July 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that Blackpink's debut would be on August 8, 2016. Promotions for the group's debut began in the first week of August 2016 with the release of teaser images, videos, and advertisements. The first girl group to debut under YG Entertainment in seven years, Blackpink released their debut single album, Square One, on August 8, 2016, consisting of tracks "Boombayah" and "Whistle".

Their discography also utilizes a range of musical styles such as R&B, Arabic music, ballads, disco, and rock. Their music is often characterized by a fusion of "bold rapping, powerful singing and chic styling"; a signature element in their songs is the frequent use of bass drops, particularly before the chorus, which is considered a defining aspect of their sound by music critics.The Korea Herald came to associate Blackpink's soundscape with "grand intros, thumping bass and trap-EDM choruses". The lyrical themes of the group frequently encompass topics such as independence, female empowerment, the aftermath of breakups, navigating toxic relationships, and the nuances of romance. Jisoo explained in an interview with Rolling Stone that the members are "involved from the beginning" in their creative process, from "building the blocks" to "adding this or that feeling" and "exchanging feedback".

Early in their career, Blackpink stated that they wanted to emulate labelmate 2NE1 and "show [their] own unique color". During an episode of Carpool Karaoke in 2023, the members of the group expressed how they were inspired by TLC and the Spice Girls as they grew up listening to their music. Jennie commented that the group admired the vocals, rap, and hip-hop style of TLC, as well as the distinct individual characters of the Spice Girls, saying, "That was something that we were aiming for and it was such an iconic girl group in history that we grew up listening to."

Blackpink aimed to represent two contrasting aspects of their musical persona, mirroring their name. The "black" facet of the group encapsulates their edgier, "girl crush" image, while the "pink" facet reflects their more feminine and vibrant image. In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Rosé explained that the group feels that "there's two colors that represented us the most 'cause we're very girly but at the same time we're very savage too," naming their song "Pretty Savage" as the song that described them best because "it kind of goes with 'black pink.'" At the press conference commemorating the release of "Pink Venom" in August 2022, Jennie elaborated on the group's identity: "We try to express various messages through songs of various genres but Blackpink is always confident and full of confidence, I thought we were the closest." Stylistically, Blackpink are associated with the "girl crush" image in K-pop; Insider wrote that they "[burst] onto the K-pop scene with a set of singles that set them on a path to becoming the ambassadors of the 'girl crush' concept", encapsulating "confidence, sexiness, and inspirational assurance, in the K-pop landscape". Billboard called them "K-pop's most visible representatives" of girl crush following the release of "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" (2018). Cultural critic Jung Deok-hyeon analyzed Blackpink for having established a confident image in K-pop, and for building a "solid fandom" centered on women and female empowerment. News1 commented that the group broke the prevailing notion that only boy groups attract a strong fandom and thereby possess an advantage in the industry. Blackpink's influence extends beyond music and into the fashion industry—each member has served as global ambassadors for different luxury brands: Jisoo for Dior, Jennie for Chanel, Rosé for Yves Saint Laurent, and Lisa for Bulgari and Celine. Fashion trade journal WWD remarked that "What Blackpink has done better than any girl group before it is leverage fashion as a tool to position its members as larger-than-life idols", "But in carefully edited videos and behind-the-scenes features released by the group's record label, members exude a giddy kind of youth that still makes them approachable." The group has been noted by international media outlets for drawing to South Korean hanbok, through their modern re-interpretations of the traditional costume in their "How You Like That" music video and performances. The group considers fashion to be an important part of their public image, with Jennie telling Elle magazine that it "definitely empowers us as much as music does" and Rosé describing it as inseparable from their music. Their style has been noted by South China Morning Post for blending group uniformity with individual tastes. Since their debut, Blackpink have emerged as a prominent act in K-pop. They have been referred to as the "biggest girl group in the world" by various organizations such as The Recording Academy and Rolling Stone, "biggest K-pop girl band on the planet" by Vogue, NPR, and BBC, and "K-pop Queens" by Billboard and The New York Times. While discussing the evolution of girl groups since the early 20th century, The Recording Academy noted how "the success of K-pop girl groups shot to a new level when Blackpink entered the scene in 2016". The Circle Chart observed a significant rise in the use of English lyrics in South Korean girl group songs, a trend that emerged after Blackpink's international breakthrough in 2020; the organization saw it as an attempt for girl groups to broaden their listener base to include audiences outside of Korea. Various artists have cited Blackpink as a direct influence, including H1-Key, Tri.be, Kiss of Life, Classy, Primrose, Le Sserafim's Kazuha, Lapillus' Shana and Haeun, Fifty Fifty's Saena, Mimiirose's Seo Yun-ju, and @onefive. In South Korea, they ranked first on Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 list in 2019, third in 2020, second in 2021 and 2022, and third in 2023. They were the first girl group to make Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia and were named on the 2019 Time 100 Next list of rising stars, credited with "heralding a new era of Korean acts stepping past language barriers to play global stages" when they became the first K-pop group to perform at Coachella, the world's largest music festival. Bloomberg wrote that alongside BTS, "Blackpink has achieved a level of global popularity unprecedented in the history of music". The group was hailed one of the "world's most influential and bestselling artists" by Rolling Stone while South China Morning Post highlighted Blackpink, BTS and K-dramas as leaders in the global interest of Korean pop culture. The New York Times recognized Blackpink as one of South Korea's major cultural exports alongside companies such as Samsung, LG and Hyundai, with entities like Blackpink, Squid Game, and Parasite appearing "as ubiquitous as any Samsung phone". Sisa Journal identified Blackpink's global influence as a stand out even among the other greatest girl groups in K-pop history, such as Girls' Generation, 2NE1, Wonder Girls and Twice, and expressed that just as the symbol of girl groups for pop music fans around the world was the Spice Girls in the mid-1990s, "the representative image of today's girl group is none other than Blackpink." Billboard recognized Blackpink as "the most successful K-pop girl group to have impacted the U.S. market", citing the group's performances at Coachella as well as their Billboard 200 chart-topping album Born Pink. In 2020, CJ E&M honored the group as one of the ten "2020 Visionary" figures for their contributions in spreading Korean pop culture globally. During South Korean President Moon Jae-in's 2021 New Year's address, Blackpink was cited as a leader in the promotion of South Korea's image abroad and highlighted government support of such entities as a key strategy in "firmly [solidifying] Korea's status as a cultural powerhouse". Blackpink have amassed a large following on social media and streaming platforms; they became the most-subscribed music group on YouTube in September 2019, the most-subscribed female artist in July 2020, and the most-subscribed music act overall in September 2021, with over 90 million subscribers as of July 2023. Blackpink became the most-followed girl group on Spotify in November 2019; as of April 2023, they have over 40 million followers. On Instagram, the group's members are the four most-followed individuals based in South Korea (in order from first to fourth: Lisa, Jennie, Jisoo and Rosé). Blackpink were named the biggest musicians in the world in the month of October 2020 in Bloomberg's Pop Star Power Ranking. People included Blackpink in their listing of women changing the contemporary music industry while Variety named the group one of the most impactful figures in global entertainment. They became the third girl group in history to cover Rolling Stone, after the Spice Girls and Destiny's Child, when they covered the magazine's June 2022 issue. Time named Blackpink the Entertainer of the Year for 2022, in recognition of their impact both as a group and individually in the music, fashion, and acting industries. Blackpink have acquired numerous endorsement deals in various industries throughout their career. Globally, Blackpink were ambassadors for Kia Motors, which also served as title sponsor for the group's In Your Area World Tour. In North America, Blackpink partnered with toy company Jazwares to create a collection of dolls styled in outfits from their music videos, as well as other collectible toy lines. In June 2020, Blackpink collaborated with Zepeto, a South Korean 3D avatar service operated by Naver Z, to offer fans characters that correspond to each member that allow fans to see the characters sing and dance, as well as take pictures together on the app. Blackpink's virtual fan-sign event on the app was popular among international fans, with the service surpassing 30 million participants as of September 11, 2020, and the number of new users increasing by 300,000 following the release of the "Ice Cream" dance performance video. The group also teamed up with the popular battle royale game PUBG Mobile to release collaborative content and events within the game. In Asia, Blackpink endorsed Samsung, working with the company on multiple campaigns to promote its electronics products, such as the #danceAwesome challenge to promote Galaxy A. In August 2019, Samsung launched a Blackpink Special Edition set in Southeast Asia, comprising its Galaxy A80, Galaxy Watch Active, and Galaxy Buds. The group featured Galaxy S10+ and Galaxy Buds in their "Kill This Love" music video. In November 2018, Blackpink became the first-ever regional brand ambassadors for Singaporean e-commerce platform, Shopee, as part of its partnership with YG Group in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Thai bank KBank began its partnership with Blackpink in November 2019. In September 2020, Blackpink became spokesperson for Pepsi in the Asia-Pacific region, including Greater China, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Philippine telecommunications company Globe Telecom began its partnership with Blackpink in December 2020 as its brand ambassadors. In South Korea, Blackpink have been brand ambassadors or spoke-models for Sprite Korea, Woori Bank, Adidas, luxury hotel and resort Paradise City, contact lens brand Olens, and hair-care brand Mise-En-Scène. In May 2017, Blackpink became honorary ambassadors for customs service company Incheon Main Customs; banners and videos featuring their images would greet foreign travelers at Incheon International Airport. The group also endorsed and collaborated with other high-end brands, such as sportswear brands Puma and Reebok, luxury fashion houses Louis Vuitton and Dior Cosmetics, cosmetics brand Moonshot, handbag brand St. Scott London, and department store Shibuya 109. Blackpink also released merchandise in collaboration with Tokyo Girls Collection x Cecil McBee in Japan. In July 2018 and August 2020, the group ranked first among all artists in brand reputation based on analyses by The Korea Reputation Research Institute, making them the only female act to do so. In December 2018, Blackpink donated their prize money from the Elle Style Awards 2018, worth ₩20 million (around US$16,630), to low-income and single-parent households in South Korea. In April 2019, Blackpink made a donation of ₩40 million (around US$33,300) to the Hope Bridge Association of the National Disaster Relief for the victims of the Goseong wildfire in South Korea, doing the same in March 2022 by donating ₩500 million to pay for damage repair caused by the wildfires happening in Gangwon and Gyeongbuk. In April 2020, Blackpink released face masks via UMG-affiliated merchandising company Bravado. All proceeds benefited the Recording Academy's MusiCares initiative, which launched a relief fund in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the music industry. In December 2020, the group called for action on climate change and promoted the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), hoping their fans will "join us on this journey" to "learn about what's happening, what needs to happen and how we can play our part." On February 25, 2021, Blackpink were formally appointed official advocates for COP26 in Seoul, where they received a personal appreciation letter written by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, for their work in the spread of climate change awareness. On October 23, 2021, the group was a part of the lineup for the YouTube Originals special entitled "Dear Earth", which focused on encouraging viewers to become more environmentally conscious. In his speech for a state banquet hosting South Korean President President Yoon Suk Yeol in Buckingham Palace, King Charles III offered praise to Blackpink's work as ambassadors to environmental sustainability causes. Blackpink's accolades include eleven Guinness World Records, fourteen Circle Chart Music Awards, seven Golden Disc Awards, eleven MAMA Awards, five Melon Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, three People's Choice Awards, four Seoul Music Awards, a Billboard Music Award, a MTV Europe Music Award, and a Teen Choice Award. They are the first Korean girl group to win an MTV Video Music Award and the first to receive a nomination at the Brit Awards. Following the release of "How You Like That" and its music video on June 26, 2020, Blackpink broke five Guinness World Records, including those for the most-viewed YouTube video in the first 24 hours of release (with 86.3 million views) and the most viewers for a video premiere on YouTube (reaching 1.66 million peak concurrent viewers for the live premiere). In 2021, Blackpink was awarded the Guinness World Record for the most-subscribed band on YouTube, with over 60 million subscribers. In 2022, Blackpink was awarded three further Guinness World Records, the first for being the inaugural winner of the Best Metaverse Performance category at the MTV Video Music Awards, and the latter two for being the first K-pop girl group to top the UK and US album charts respectively with their second studio album Born Pink. In 2023, Blackpink was awarded the Guinness World Record for the most-streamed female group on Spotify, with over 8.8 billion streams on the platform. They were also awarded the Guinness World Record for the most viewed music channel on YouTube for a group, with over 30.15 billion views.
