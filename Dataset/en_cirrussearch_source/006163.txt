The Servicio Central de Informática (SeCIU, Central Computing Service) of the University of the Republic is the responsible authority to manage and register domains under .uy and its subdomains since April 1990, delegated by IANA through InterNIC. The domains under .com.uy are managed and registered by Antel via its website dominiosuy (nic.com.uy) instead. Domains directly under .uy can be registered directly at SeCIU or after the registrar entities it authorized, being Antel and other private companies.
