Kuznetsova had wins over Ekaterina Makarova, Garbiñe Muguruza, Sam Stosur and Lucie Šafářová, and then defeated Maria Sharapova in two sets. She lost to Petra Kvitová in the final in straight sets. Kuznetsova reached the second round of Roland Garros, losing there to long-time rival Francesca Schiavone in three tricky sets, 7–6, 5–7, 8–10. It was the third-longest women's match in the history of the French Open, lasting 3 hours and 50 minutes. This loss resulted to her exit from the top 20, losing ten ranking positions. Kuznetsova played a steady grass season, with a win–loss of 6–3, the second-best result judged by wins in her career on grass. She reached the second round of Wimbledon for the first time since 2011. Kuznetsova withdrew from most of the North America tournaments, including the Rogers Cup and Cincinnati, due to a left leg injury. At the US Open, she lost in the first round to Kristina Mladenovic. Kuznetsova renewed herself in Guangzhou, reaching the quarterfinals. She eventually received her first trophy this season at the Kremlin Cup with a straight sets victory over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the final, becoming the 15th title in her career. Svetlana repeated her season start. In Auckland she reached the second round where she was knocked out by Tamira Paszek. She then triumphed in Sydney, defeating top-seeded Halep in the semifinals in three tight sets, and qualifier Monica Puig from Puerto Rico in the finals in two sets. At the Australian Open, seeded No. 23, she reached the second round, where she lost surprisingly to returning Kateryna Bondarenko from Ukraine. Seeded 8th at the Dubai Tennis Championships, Kuznetsova suffered a shocking demolition by Julia Görges in the first round. Kuznetsova then traveled to Doha for the Qatar Open. She was seeded 12th and was drawn to face Julia Görges in the first round for consecutive tournaments. However, this time Svetlana won in straight sets but lost out to Jeļena Ostapenko in the second round. At the BNP Paribas Open, Svetlana was seeded 16th and received a bye into the second round. However, she suffered a loss to CoCo Vandeweghe. Kuznetsova then reached her second Miami Open final of her career. There she beat Carina Witthöft, Caroline Garcia, Serena Williams, Ekaterina Makarova and Timea Bacsinszky, all, except Bacsinszky, in three tight sets. The last time Kuznetsova defeated a world No. 1 player was at the 2009 Roland Garros final. She also stopped the American's 20-match winning streak. However, Kuznetsova missed her chance to return to the Top 10 for the first time since 2009 when she lost to Victoria Azarenka in the final. Kuznetsova reached the quarterfinals of the Italian Open, where she suffered a clear loss by Serena Williams. As a result, she jumped four ranking positions, to No.15. On 15 April, Kuznetsova replaced Sharapova from the top position among Russian players, the first time since 2011. The Russian reached the fourth round in singles at the French Open, losing to eventual champion Garbiñe Muguruza. In doubles, she partnered with Margarita Gasparyan to reach the semifinals. This became her best Grand Slam doubles result since 2012 Australian Open, and her best French Open doubles result since 2004. By reaching the fourth round of the Wimbledon, where she lost to Serena Williams, she ensured herself a place in the top ten for the first time since 2010. Then at the Rogers Cup, the Russian reached the quarterfinal where she was beaten by Halep. Kuznetsova qualified to the 2016 Summer Olympics in singles and doubles. In doubles she should have partnered with Gasparyan, but the young tennis player cited her injury; she was replaced by Daria Kasatkina. Kuznetsova reached the third round in singles and the quarterfinal in doubles. She again reached the quarterfinal in a Premier 5 tournament, doing so in Cincinnati. At the US Open, Kuznetsova suffered a disappointing loss against resurgent Caroline Wozniacki despite leading 4–0 in the first set. Kuznetsova rebounded at the Wuhan Open, reaching the semifinals which boosted her hopes to qualify for the WTA Finals for the first time since 2009. This run included defeating defending champion Venus Williams and Agnieszka Radwańska, after saving match point. She then lost to fellow Singapore contender Dominika Cibulková in a tight three set match. At the China Open, Kuznetsova received a bye into the second round due to her impressive performance at Wuhan. She defeated Misaki Doi but lost to yet another Singapore Contender Madison Keys in the third round. Being the favourite for the title in Tianjin after top seed Agnieszka Radwańska withdrew from her quarterfinal match, Kuznetsova disappointingly lost to Alison Riske in the semifinals. This would have kept her out of Singapore, until Serena Williams withdrew from Singapore and that left a spot up to grabs. As the defending champion, Kuznetsova took a wildcard into the Kremlin Cup, knowing that she had to win the title to qualify for Singapore. Kuznetsova handled the pressure well; defeating Alizé Cornet, Tímea Babos, Elina Svitolina and Daria Gavrilova in the final to win the title. This win automatically took the place in the last spot at WTA Finals for the first time since 2009 and also meant that Kuznetsova managed to successfully defend a title for the first time in her career, she replaced Johanna Konta as the potential last qualifier spot. In the WTA Finals she defeated Radwańska and Pliskova in 3 sets before losing to Garbiñe Muguruza to top her group. She then lost to eventual champion Dominika Cibulková Kuznetsova as fifth seeded started well at the Brisbane International, reaching the quarterfinals but losing there to Muguruza. She lost in the second round of the Sydney Open to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in two straight sets. At the Australian Open she got into the fourth round, her best result there since 2013, but lost again to Pavlyuchenkova in two straight sets. Her disappointing season continued at the St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy as she crashed out in her first quarterfinal of the year against Yulia Putintseva, the eventual finalist. Kuznetsova then skipped both the Dubai Tennis Championships and the Qatar Open due to an injury. Her first tournament back from the injury, she won her opening round match at the Indian Wells Open against Johanna Larsson, before following it up with impressive victories over Roberta Vinci, Caroline Garcia, taking revenge for her two losses this year against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and then earned an excellent victory over the in-form Karolína Plíšková to reach her first final at Indian Wells since 2008 – she ultimately ended up losing to compatriot Elena Vesnina in three sets. She then lost to Venus Williams in the fourth round at the Miami event. Kuznetsova's first clay court event of the year came at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix where she was the eighth seed and the title favourite. However, she failed to capitalize on her chances as she fell to eventual champion local wildcard Laura Siegemund, who eventually went on to unexpectedly clinch the title. She then reached the semifinals of the Madrid Open, losing to Mladenovic. As a result, she climbed to the eighth world ranking position. However, after a disappointing performance in Rome, Kuznetsova returned to the 9th position. At the French Open, Kuznetsova defended her points as she went to the fourth round, losing there to Wozniacki. The results from the grass court season were one of the best in Kuznetsova's career, producing a win–loss record of 6–2, repeating the 2005 record. She reached the quarterfinals of Eastbourne, losing to Pliskova in three sets. She then improved her performance at Wimbledon, defeating Ons Jabeur, Ekaterina Makarova, Polona Hercog and No. 10 Agnieszka Radwańska on her way to reach the quarterfinals, where she fell to eventual champion Garbiñe Muguruza. She was once again beaten by Muguruza in Cincinnati, but now in three tight sets. By the end of the season, Kuznetsova showed low results due to her hand injury, twice losing in the second round in a total of three tournaments, after receiving a bye. She withdrew from the Kremlin Cup, where she was the two-times defending champion. On 23 October, she fell out of the top-10 and dropped to the 11th position, ending her 65 weeks streak in the top 10. Kuznetsova continued her poor performance on court. She reached a quarterfinal only once in an International event in Istanbul. Even at Roland Garros, where she has been traditionally playing well, Kuznetsova lost in the first round to world No. 3 Garbiñe Muguruza. After her first-round loss in Wimbledon, Kuznetsova pulled out of the top 100. However, she rebounded herself winning the Citi Open in Washington D.C., defeating Donna Vekić in three sets. By that, she extended her tournament's record to 11–0. Furthermore, she returned to the top 100 after this success; however, after her loss at Cincy, she dropped just outside the top 100. She finished the season ranked 107, her worst ranking since 2001.[citation needed] After half a year off battling injury, Kuznetsova made a comeback at the Ladies Open Lugano, reaching the quarterfinals. One of her best results in the European swing a win over world No. 10 Aryna Sabalenka at the Madrid Open.[citation needed] Kuznetsova could not defend her title at the Washington Open, after she was granted a visa too late, although she applied in February. This led to her losing 90 ranking positions, from 108 to 198. In the U.S. swing, Kuznetsova reached the third round of the Rogers Cup, losing to Simona Halep in straight sets. Ranked 153 and earning a wild card, Kuznetsova reached the final at the following Western & Southern Open, defeating 11th seeded Anastasija Sevastova, Dayana Yastremska, eighth seeded Sloane Stephens, third seeded Karolína Plíšková and top-seeded Ashleigh Barty. She was defeated by Madison Keys. As a result, Kuznetsova went from No. 153 to No. 62 in the world ranking.[citation needed] At the US Open, she was stunned in the first round by Kristie Ahn. She successfully qualified at Wuhan, defeating wildcard Zheng Qinwen and Bethanie Mattek-Sands, and defeated Yulia Putintseva and Hsieh Su-wei, before falling in the third round to Elina Svitolina. At Beijing, Kuznetsova was defeated by Christina McHale in the first round in three sets. Kuznetsova's final event of the year was at Moscow, where she was defeated in the first round by eventual semifinalist Karolína Muchová. She ended the year ranked No. 54.[citation needed] At Hobart, Kuznetsova lost in two sets to Magda Linette in the first round. She then participated in the Australian Open for the first time in three years, where she defeated Markéta Vondroušová in the first round, before falling to Camila Giorgi. At St. Petersburg, she defeated Jennifer Brady before losing to Belinda Bencic. At Doha, she defeated Çağla Büyükakçay and Iga Świątek, received a walkover from Amanda Anisimova and then avenged her St. Petersburg defeat against Bencic in straight sets to reach the semifinals for her first top-ten victory of the year. She lost to eventual champion Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals. Despite the loss, her ranking rose to No. 32 in the world, and she was due to be seeded for the first time in years at Indian Wells, before the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[citation needed] Upon the resumption of the tour, Kuznetsova opted to skip the US Open Series due to pandemic concerns. She made her return at the İstanbul Cup as the top seed, but was stunned by Eugenie Bouchard in her first match. Her first wins came at the Italian Open, including an upset over 14th seed Anett Kontaveit. She lost to Elina Svitolina in the third round. Her last tournament of the year was the French Open where she lost to compatriot Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the first round. Kuznetsova began her season at the Grampians Trophy after going through a 14-day hard quarantine. She lost to Jennifer Brady in the first round despite leading by an early break. After defeating Barbora Strýcová in the first round of the Australian Open, Kuznetsova lost to Belinda Bencic in a tight match after leading by a break in the deciding set. During the Middle East swing, Kuznetsova lost in the first round of the Qatar Open to Victoria Azarenka but managed to reach the third round of the Dubai Tennis Championships with three-set wins over Wang Qiang and world No. 5, Elina Svitolina, for her first top-ten win of the year. She then reached her first semifinal of the year at her home tournament, the St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy. She survived a scare against teenage rising star Wang Xinyu in her opener before producing a comeback against Jaqueline Cristian in the quarterfinals. However, she lost to Daria Kasatkina in the semifinals despite leading by a set. It was the start of a five-match losing streak as Kuznetsova lost in the first round of the Miami Open to Alizé Cornet, and her only clay-court tournament was at the French Open where she lost to Azarenka. She then lost in the first round of the Wimbledon Championships to qualifier Lesley Pattinama Kerkhove. Due to injury concerns, Kuznetsova gave up her spot from the Olympics for another compatriot. She ended her season prematurely due to lingering injuries, with her comeback date not disclosed. She fell out of the top 100 in September 2021 after being inactive. Belgian tennis legend Justine Henin was one of Kuznetsova's leading rivals during the middle portion of her career. Of the 19 matches that they played, Kuznetsova earned three victories, including their final one. Henin won their first meeting in the 2003 Wimbledon Quarterfinal when Kuznetsova, just 17, lost in straight sets. Kuznetsova earned her first win over the Belgian at the semifinals of the 2004 Total Qatar Open, where she went on to lose in the final to Anastasia Myskina. This result projected the Russian into the world's top 20 players for the first time. Arguably their finest match followed in the fourth round of the 2005 French Open, where Henin saved two match points en route to a three set victory. Henin went on to win the tournament, defending her title a year later by beating Kuznetsova in the 2006 final. Henin additionally defeated Kuznetsova in the finals of the 2007 US Open grand slam tournament in straight sets. Kuznetsova beat Henin for the second time in the semifinals of the 2007 Qatar Telecom German Open tournament in Berlin in three sets, becoming the second-to-last person to do so in 2007. The Belgian went on a seven-month, 32-match winning streak after Wimbledon, having lifted the French Open directly beforehand. Henin unexpectedly retired in 2008, but returned to the tour briefly in 2010, only to suffer an elbow tear at Wimbledon. Justine Henin made one final comeback following her injury at the 2011 Australian Open, where Kuznetsova defeated her in a dramatic match in the third round. Due to the recurring nature of her elbow injury, Henin retired immediately following her match with Kuznetsova, making the Russian the final person to play against and defeat her. Kuznetsova and Agnieszka Radwańska played each other eighteen times between 2007 and 2017, with Kuznetsova leading the head-to-head 14–4. Their first meeting was at Wimbledon in 2007 with Kuznetsova winning in straight sets. Kuznetsova won their first three meetings, but in the four meetings that eventuated in 2008, Kuznetsova lost three of them, including in the third round of the Australian Open and in the fourth round of Wimbledon. Additionally, she also lost against her at the year-end championships later in the year, after Radwańska replaced an injured Ana Ivanovic. Kuznetsova subsequently dominated Radwańska in future meetings, winning six meetings between the pair between 2009 and 2012, including an upset victory at the 2012 French Open, until Radwańska stopped the rot at the 2014 Mutua Madrid Open, saving a match point in the process. Prior to 2014, Kuznetsova's two most recent titles came by defeating Radwańska in the championship match, first at Beijing in 2009 and then at San Diego in 2010. In 2015, Kuznetsova defeated Radwańska again in the opening match of Fed Cup tie between Russia and Poland. At the 2016 Wuhan Open, Kuznetsova saved a match point in the second set en route to winning a three-set, quarterfinal thriller, and also saved a match point when they met at the WTA Finals in Singapore later that year. Their most recent and final meeting, at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, saw Kuznetsova win in straight sets, a decade on from their first meeting. Kuznetsova and Ana Ivanovic played each other fourteen times between 2005 and 2015 inclusive. Kuznetsova struggled for most of the rivalry, losing eight of the eleven meetings between the pair. Kuznetsova's only victory in the main tour came in the quarterfinals of the 2006 Sydney International; her other two wins over Ivanovic came in the 2010 and 2012 Fed Cups. They met in two finals, with Kuznetsova losing both: first in Berlin in 2007 and at Indian Wells in 2008, the latter of which they contested as the top two seeds. Additionally, at the 2007 WTA Tour Championships, Kuznetsova lost to Ivanovic in three sets on the Serb's 20th birthday. Their last meeting was in the third round of the 2015 China Open with Kuznetsova losing in three sets. Kuznetsova joined team Russia in 2004 in the doubles and singles competition. Her teammates were Myskina and Zvonareva in singles and Likhovtseva in doubles. They competed against Australia in the first round in the Luzhniki Stadium in an indoor carpet court. Kuznetsova defeated Molik and Molik/Rennae Stubbs. The result was 4–1 for Russia; Myskina lost to Molik. In the quarterfinal they faced Argentina in Buenos Aires. Kuznetsova lost to Gisela Dulko. In the doubles she defeated Dulko and partner Patricia Tarabini. The final score was the same as in the first round, 4–1. In the semifinal they faced Austria. Again in Moscow, Kuznetsova defeated Yvonne Meusburger, Daniela Kix and Meusburger and Patricia Wartusch all in straight sets. The final score was a straight 5–0. In the final they faced France only three days after the semifinal. Kuznetsova beat Dechy, but lost to Tatiana Golovin. Russia won the final 3–2 for its first Fed Cup victory. Kuznetsova did not participate in the next two years. She rejoined in 2007 and defeated Spain's Lourdes Domínguez Lino and Anabel Medina Garrigues in the quarterfinal. She was elected in the final that year. There, she won against Mara Santangelo and Schiavone from Italy. Russia again won that year's Cup. The next year she again participated. Playing against the United States she defeated 282nd-ranked Ahsha Rolle in the semifinal. In contrast, Kuznetsova lost the doubles competition with partner Elena Vesnina, beaten by Liezel Huber and Vania King. In the end, Russia defeated the US 3–2. In the final, Russia defeated Spain as it had the prior year. Kuznetsova won against Carla Suárez Navarro and Garrigues. Team Russia won the 2008 Fed Cup with 4–0. In 2009 Kuznetsova joined the group again. She played against China in the quarterfinal and won in the singles over opponent Yan Zi, and in the doubles, together with Dementieva, over Sun Tiantian and Yan Zi, after losing the first set. Russia won against China in a straight 5–0 final scoreline. Russia lost to Italy in the semifinal. Kuznetsova was the only winner, defeating Pennetta. At the 2010 Fed Cup, Russia defeated Serbia in the quarterfinal 3–2. There, Kuznetsova won two of three matches, beating Ivanović, and Ivanović and Janković in doubles, with partner Kleybanova. She lost to Janković. Kuznetsova joined the Russian team in 2011. In the first round they faced France on 5 and 6 February. In the first round, Kuznetsova was defeated by Alizé Cornet, but defeated Virginie Razzano a day later. She teamed up with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and defeated Cornet/Julie Coin in the doubles. Russia became just the fourth nation to come back from 0–2 down in a Fed Cup tie since the best-of-five-match format was introduced to the World Group in 1995. Russia defeated Italy in the semifinal in 5–0. There, Svetlana Kuznetsova defeated Roberta Vinci. Russia succeeded, the first time since 2008, in a final in the Fed Cup. Russia, however, lost against Czech Republic in 3–2. The first round of the 2012 Fed Cup saw three wins in the single competition, two of which were made by Kuznetsova, the first against Sílvia Soler Espinosa, the second against Carla Suárez Navarro. The pair Kuznetsova/Petrova retired in their last match due to Kuznetsova's fatigue, but Russia still won in 3–2. Team Russia lost against the Serbian team in the semifinal, 2–3. Although winning the first match against Ana Ivanovic in three sets, Kuznetsova was later defeated by Jelena Janković in two straight sets. After a two-years break in the Fed Cup, Kuznetsova participated at the 2015 Fed Cup, where team Russia played against Poland in the Round Robin. With her win over Agnieszka Radwańska in three sets, Kuznetsova beat a top-10 player in the Fed Cup for the first time. In the semifinals against Germany she played two rubbers, one was won against Julia Görges, another against Andrea Petkovic. With her win over Görges, Kuznetsova became the second-best Russian Fed Cup player by total wins, with 27 won rubbers; the absolute leader is Larisa Savchenko, with 40 won rubbers. Kuznetsova was not called in the final. Kuznetsova at the 2016 Fed Cup lost in four hours against Richèl Hogenkamp in the first day, becoming the longest Fed Cup singles match in the history. Kuznetsova received training at the Sanchez-Casal Academy in Barcelona, Spain from the age of 14 and was coached under direction of club president Emilio Sánchez and Sergio Casal. Her major coaching relationship was with Stefan Ortega who was a regular guest in her player's box and helped advance her game. After a series of poor finals' results Kuznetsova ended her relationship with the Sanchez-Casal academy in 2009 and moved to Moscow on the advice of Roger Federer to start training with experienced Russian coach Olga Morozova. They ended their relationship after the BNP Paribas Open in March 2009, after which Kuznetsova was without a coach. As of May 2009 her coach was former Russian tennis player and Fed Cup coach Larisa Neiland. She was coached for a short period by Loïc Courteau after trying unsuccessfully to convince Mauresmo to coach her. Her next coach was for a short time the former Spanish tennis player Carlos Cuadrado, until he was replaced with her former coach Neiland. After the loss in the Italian Open, Kuznetsova has switched to Morozova, then to Amos Mansdorf[citation needed] and finally in May 2012 to Argentine Hernán Gumy, former coach of Marat Safin. She said in an interview, that she likes working with him and understands with him well. With his help she won three matches in straight sets at the 2012 French Open, including claiming the scalp of then-world No. 3 Agnieszka Radwańska. After a poor late 2012 season, Kuznetsova has switched between Gumy and Carlos Martínez; sometimes both serve as coaches. She is currently coached by Javier Piles. Svetlana Kuznetsova plays right-handed and has a two-handed backhand. She is an all-round player. She has been described as technically the most complete player on tour. She is noted for her great speed on court and her strong forehand with much topspin. She is capable of producing effective volley winners providing an agile touch. According to Richard Pagliaro of ESPN, "Kuznetsova can alter the spin, speed and height of her shots and owns the variety that plays well on clay" but since her recent failures, "consistency has eluded her, and she's prone to flakiness and frustration under pressure." Jeff Cooper of about.com meant her greatest strengths were the "outstandingly powerful and accurate forehand. Strong topspin on forehand and backhand. Solid serve. Great speed" and outlined her basic style as "power baseliner" with "no major weakness". She is known for her unpredictability and inconsistency. Kuznetsova extended her long standing endorsement agreements with the sport brand Fila on 13 January 2012. She debuted with the new apparel at the 2012 Australian Open alongside fellow Fila player Kim Clijsters. According to chairman Gene Yoon, "Both players are longtime members of the Fila family and have played an important role in Fila's rich history in tennis." However that contract was not extended beyond 2012. Subsequently, shortly before the start of the 2013 Australian Open, Kuznetsova signed a new apparel endorsement deal with Chinese sports apparel brand Qiaodan. Svetlana Kuznetsova appeared in video games Top Spin 2, Top Spin 3, Virtua Tennis 2009 and Virtua Tennis 4 as a playable character.
