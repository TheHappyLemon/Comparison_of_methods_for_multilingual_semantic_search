Frosinone Calcio (Italian pronunciation: [froziˈnoːne] ) The club was founded on 5 March 1906 under the name Unione Sportiva Frusinate, but conventionally the year 1928 is indicated as the beginning of competitive activities of significant importance. Following cancellation by the Italian Football Federation, it was refounded in 1959 and in 1990. In the 2014–15 season the club played in Serie B for the sixth time in its history. The club earned its first promotion to the top flight Serie A in the 2015–16 season, but were relegated back down to Serie B after just one season. In the 2018–19 season it was promoted to Serie A for a second time. After a long tradition of playing in Serie C, in recent years,[when?] following the historic[tone] promotion which took place in the 2005–06 season, the club participated in five consecutive seasons in Serie B, becoming, after the two teams in Rome, the third most notable team of the region of Lazio. In the club's history at a national level, Frosinone have won two championships of Serie C2 (1986–87 and 2003–04) and two of Serie D (1965–66 and 1970–71). On 16 May 2015, the Ciociari, with a 3–1 win over Crotone, secured their first, historic promotion to Serie A. "The “Unione Sportiva Frusinate” is established in Frosinone. The association has as its main purpose the diffusion among the younger generations of gymnastic disciplines, fencing, football and athletic sports with the aim of physical and intellectual education of Frosinone youth." Constitutive Act of the "Unione Sportiva Frusinate", article 1 (5 March 1906) Frosinone Calcio was founded on 5 March 1906 under the name Unione Sportiva Frusinate. The colours of the team were originally red and blue which were later changed to the current yellow and blue.[citation needed] By year of foundation, the Frosinone company ranks third among those still active in the Lazio, after "S.S. Lazio" (1900) and "S.S. Formia" (1905)[citation needed] On 5 March 1906, the lawyer Leone Vivoli, future mayor of Frosinone, gave birth to the "Unione Sportiva Frusinate".[citation needed] The objectives in the articles of association included the diffusion of various sports and among them there was explicitly included football.[citation needed] On 14 March 1906 Il Messaggero reported the news as follows: «Made up of about thirty effective members, it was formed in our city with premises in Corso Vittorio Emanuele n.2 [NB: today Corso della Repubblica] , a Frosinone sports club chaired by the lawyer Leone Vivoli. Councilors: student R. Giovannelli - accountant G. Tora - receiver G. Pesci - engineer E. Marzi - Inspector E. Toscano - Secretary Gabriele Antonucci - Sports Director Gerardo Bodin de Chadelard». The presence of competitive football-related activities is demonstrated by some documents immediately following the signing of the company statute, including a photo dating back to 1907, taken from the Bottoni archive, which shows a youth team of Frosinone footballers probably aged between 10 and 12 years.[citation needed] Il Messaggero underlined, in the edition of 1 February 1907, the feedback acquired in a short time by the new sports association in the city: «This sports union which has as its main purpose physical education, given the ever increasing number of members , has occupied new premises [...] The brilliant meeting is frequented by the most respectable people of the city who praise and encourage the healthy development of the Association». The first corporate colours, as specified in the articles of association in article IV, were red and blue, taken from the city coat of arms. It showed a rampant lion on a red background and a blue cross band with the motto "Bellator Frusino", given by Sillo Italico, when the city refused to surrender to Hannibal's armies.[citation needed] Given the cost of the uniforms of the time, it is unlikely that the rossoblu uniform was worn from the beginning.[citation needed] Article III of the Articles of Association stated, with a rather[tone] modern approach for the time,[according to whom?] that the sports association abstained from any activity of a political and religious nature[citation needed] The first playing field adopted by the company was located in Frosinone along today's via Cicerone (at the time called via Casilina Nord) near the municipal villa, while the historic "Stadio Matusa" (which would have resisted, with modifications and extensions subsequent, until 2017) was built only in 1932.[citation needed] The same club, however, has conventionally chosen as its date of origin not the foundation of the sports club (5 March 1906), as is widely consolidated practice with illustrious examples such as the Genoa (1893) and Milan (1899)(sports clubs which included "cricket" and "football") but rather the change of name in "CXIX Legio M.V.S.N. Frosinone" and his consequent affiliation to the FIGC which took place over twenty years later, on 19 September 1928.[citation needed] This method appears very unusual[original research?] if we[who?] consider the establishment of many other sports clubs, such as the "Società Podistica Lazio" (which, founded in 1900, joined the FIGC in 1908 and set up a football section only in 1910) or the "Genoa Cricket and Football Club" (which became affiliated five years after being created as a sports club).[citation needed] In fact,[tone] even before the change of company name induced by the fascist regime, the U.S. Frusinate had already obtained affiliation with the FIGC in 1923 and had been involved in competitive activity by appearing in the federal ranks of the championship of the Fourth Division Lazio 1923-1924 in group B.[citation needed] The Ciociaro team in that period at an organizational level was coordinated by Augusto Diamanti, a reference figure who was in charge of the company's executives.[citation needed] In the starting lineup, among others: Biagi (goalkeeper), Armando Niro, Nobili, Magni, Luigi Diamanti, Dante and Giulio Toscani, Aldo and Renato Calmanti (the latter would also be captain for many years to come, also playing in the Prima Division until the mid-1930s, when he suddenly died of a heart attack at the age of 29). The activity of the Frosinone team at the beginning of the 1920s is testified by the sports news of the time, including an article from 1922 published in La Gazzetta dello Sport.[citation needed] It reports the description of the match played on 28 June 1922, at the Madonna della Neve football field in Frosinone, between the 59 º fanteria Frosinone and the U.S. Frusinate.[citation needed] The official meeting, directed by the referee Carlo Magni and played in the presence of the mayor Piero Gizzi and the military authorities, was valid for the assignment of the Comune di Frosinone award.[citation needed] The victory went to the selection of the Army for six goals to zero.[citation needed] Experienced players such as Vincenzo Fresia, four-time champion of Italy with Pro Vercelli and former number 9 jersey in the national team were lined up in the latter's row. Who served as a lieutenant in Frosinone in the 59th Infantry Regiment[vague][clarification needed][relevant?][citation needed] In another match played on 27 August of the same year, the Frosinone team reached the Rossoneri of the C.S. Alatri thanks to a marking[clarification needed] by its captain Renato Calmanti. At that time the presence of category players in the military selection stimulated the competitive activity of the Unione Sportiva Frusinate, which was deployed on the field with the white and blue social colours.[citation needed] After affiliation to the FIGC in 1923 and registration in the IV Lazio Division, in 1925 the Unione Sportiva Frusinate passed the baton[tone] to the new Società Sportiva Alba Frusinate.[citation needed] At the end of the decade sports activity in Frosinone received new impetus from the fascist policies of incentives for physical exercise and sport, as well as the economic and political expansion that the city underwent following the establishment of the new province of which it became the capital in 1927. In this context, on 19 September of the following year, the company changed its name again to Gruppo Sportivo CXIX Legione M.V.S.N. Frosinone , thus joining again the Italian Football Federation.[citation needed] On 25 September, the team registered for the third division group B championship.[citation needed] On 17 October 1929, the sports newspaper Il Littorale reported the news of the affiliation of the new Polisportiva Bellator Frusino to the FIGC.[citation needed] The sports club, which collected the inheritance from the CXIX Legione M.V.S.N. Frosinone , was led by Pier Luigi Tinelli.[citation needed] The team participated in the III Division championship, group C, while the following season was included in group B[vague][clarification needed][citation needed] The club, later named Bellator Frusino, managed to[tone] reach the National First Division in 1934.[citation needed] The figure of[vague][clarification needed] president Emilio Frongasse was crucial in this period.[vague][clarification needed][citation needed] In the later half of the thirties, Bellator Frusinate disbanded, and was replaced by FF.GG. Frosinone which played its football in an interprovincial tournament.[citation needed] All the championships were suspended during the Second World War and the football club Frusinate disappeared.[citation needed] The rebirth of Frosinone occurred in the 1945–1946 championship, the team competed in the Seconda Categoria championship and rose to Prima Categoria the following year, and later, following an excellent[according to whom?][tone] championship season, managed to[tone] gain promotion into Serie C-Lego Centro.[citation needed] From 1948–49 to 1951–52, the Canarini competed in the Promozione-Interregionale della Lega Centro championship, and were included in the new Quarta Serie championship during the summer of 1952.[citation needed] From 1952 to 1958, for six consecutive years, the Canarini competed in the Quarta Serie Championship, with their highest finish being fourth place, which was achieved in 1953.[citation needed] The most significant match this time was against Cosenza on 24 November 1957.[citation needed] Cosenza were playing for promotion but Frosinone took the lead (and duly[tone] won) with three minutes remaining.[citation needed] The referee, struck by a Cosenza player, fell to the ground[when?] and was booed until the end of the game.[vague][clarification needed][citation needed] Several[quantify] episodes of violence[vague] then took place and the game was transformed into a "western".[vague][clarification needed][citation needed] After leaving the stadium, the referee was chased for a few kilometres by some[quantify] Frosinone supporters.[vague][clarification needed][citation needed] Cosenza forwarded an appeal and the CAF overturned the result of the match.[citation needed] Frosinone expressed their resentment against the Lega for the injustice suffered and threatened to withdraw from the league.[citation needed] Following this, Frosinone missed the return fixture in Cosenza and other penalties by the Lega were imposed.[citation needed] The most important[why?][according to whom?] people of this time were the presidents Domenico Ferrante and Angelo Cristofaro (one of the leading figures in the history of the club),[according to whom?] a former coach Genta and players Azzoni, Gabriele, Diglio, Dini and Spinato.[citation needed] In 1958, U.S. Frosinone was founded, competing in both the Seconda Categoria and Promozione championships.[citation needed] Football returned to Frosinone in 1963 when president Cristofari together with Dante Spaziani and Augusto Orsini, announced the formation of Sporting Club Frosinone.[citation needed] In Serie D, Frosinone always finished among the top positions, and in 1966 won promotion to Serie C after an encounter with Latina.[citation needed] The following year, the canarini were relegated back to Serie D, where in 1967–68 they came third, then fifth and second.[vague][clarification needed][citation needed] The leading figures at the club during this period[according to whom?] were the Stirpe brothers, coaches De Angelis and Rambone and players Benvenuto, Caputi, Da Col, Del Sette, Fumagalli and Trentini.[vague][clarification needed][citation needed] In 1970–71, Frosinone, under club president Marocco, boasted[tone] the national record for the best defence (with goalkeeper Recchia only conceding 8 goals) and again managed promotion to Serie C, where the canarini played out four good[tone][according to whom?] seasons (the best finish was seventh in 1972) and their star[tone] player Massimo Palanca entered the football firmament,[tone][vague][clarification needed] top goalscorer of the central group of Serie C in 1974 and then later was successful[how?][vague] representing Catanzaro in Serie A.[citation needed] From 1975 to 1978 the canarini played in Serie D, reaching promotion to Serie C2 in 1976–77.[citation needed] In 1977–78, Frosinone were again relegated back to Serie D and remained there until 1982.[citation needed] The club's key protagonists of the seventies[according to whom?] were the presidents Marocco and Battista, coaches Giuseppe Banchetti and Giuseppe Lupi and players Brunello, Colletti, Dal Din, Santarelli, Masiello, Vescovi and, as mentioned earlier, Massimo Palanca.[why?][clarification needed][citation needed] Frosinone started the next decade in the best possible way.[tone][according to whom?][citation needed] In 1980–81, the Canarini were promoted to Serie C2 without losing a game.[citation needed] Among the professionals, Frosinone managed good placements and produced new talent[tone] such as Gabbriellini, Perrotti and De Paola.[citation needed] Despite a precarious financial condition, Frosinone, led by president Di Vito and coach Alberto Mari, were promoted to Serie C1.[citation needed] In 1987–88 season the Canarini played their first season in Serie C1 and finished mid-table.[citation needed] They returned immediately to Serie C2 the next season however, despite a good[according to whom?] start.[vague][clarification needed][citation needed] Goalkeeper Marco Cari and coach Alberto Mari (later replaced by Robotti) were suspended for a football related betting offence.[citation needed] Among the most important players during the 1980s[according to whom?] were Davato, Atzori, Di Liso, Cristiano, Bellini, Perrotti and Edoardo Artistico Poli,[why?][clarification needed] who then began an enviable[tone][according to whom?] football career.[citation needed] In the summer of 1990, having missed out on promotion to C1 by just three points, Frosinone was removed from the Italian Football Federation because of their financial state.[citation needed] When it seemed likely[according to whom?] that they would return to the Promozione division, the club was placed in the Interregionale, where it remained for four years.[citation needed] In 1993–94, after the championship was almost completed, the Canarini ("the canaries") were overtaken by both Giulianova and Albanova, and were relegated, but they were reinstated to Serie C after the season ended.[citation needed] In 1996, the club gained a mid-table placing in Serie C2, and was leading in Girone C of C2, but on the last day of the championship Frosinone was defeated by Benevento and was overtaken in the table by Avezzano.[citation needed] They also lost in the play-offs, being beaten in the semi-final by Albanova.[citation needed] They then played out three consecutive mediocre[tone][according to whom?] seasons.[citation needed] They survived the first two, in play-offs against Casertana and Albanova, but in the third year Frosinone was defeated by Tricase and relegated.[citation needed] In Serie D, Frosinone finished fifth in 2000, while in their second year in Serie D the team was involved in an exciting[tone][according to whom?] head-to-head battle[tone] with A.C. Martina of Apulia.[citation needed] In the end they finished second, but with an impressive[tone][according to whom?] 81 points.[citation needed] Under president Navarra and coaches Luca and Stefano Sanderra, the team returned to Serie C2.[citation needed] In their first two championships back in C2, Frosinone were managed by five different tacticians.[citation needed] After a good start,[according to whom?] the team seemed able[according to whom?] to reach the play-offs, however finished mid-table.[citation needed] In 2003, the club was taken over by a group of entrepreneurs led by Maurizio Stirpe, son of Benito, a former president of the club back in the sixties.[citation needed] Stirpe called Enrico Graziani to Frosinone as a general director.[citation needed] Graziani had already worked at Teramo, gaining the Abruzzese club promotion to C1.[citation needed] The managerial position was entrusted to Giorgini, who had spent the previous season with Serie C2 side Brindisi.[citation needed] After an average start to the season,[according to whom?] Giorgini was replaced by Daniele Arrigoni, former coach of Messina and Palermo in Serie B.[citation needed] With an already strong side,[tone] including players such as Arno, Vitali, Dario Rossi, Gianluca and Stefano De Angelis, Manca, Tatomir, Galuppi and the goalkeeper de Juliis,[relevant?] being improved in the transfer market, adding quality[tone][according to whom?] players such as De Cesare, Aquino and Buonocorre.[vague][clarification needed][citation needed] Much expectation was placed upon Enrico Buonocorre, but the trequartista live up to them.[tone][vague][clarification needed] He did however, score a crucial[how?][why?][tone][according to whom?] free kick in the match against Castel Di Sangro.[citation needed] The team performed well[according to whom?] in 2003–04 Serie C2 season, fighting for supremacy[tone] near the top of the table with Brindisi.[citation needed] The two teams will take turns to occupy first place until the very end of the season.[vague][clarification needed] On the final day, Frosinone, with a point less than Brindisi, travelled to Melfi, while Brindisi faced a tough[tone][according to whom?] trip away to Sicilian club Igea Virtus.[citation needed] Both Melfi and Igea were in the running for a place in the play-offs, leaving it all to play for[tone] in these two clashes.[tone][citation needed] Frosinone beat Melfi thanks to a great[tone][according to whom?] goal by Ciro De Cesare, while Brindisi failed to[tone] beat Igea.[citation needed] Frosinone were now[when?] back in Serie C1 for the first time in sixteen years.[citation needed] The 2003–04 season is remembered[by whom?] not only for the historic[tone][according to whom?] promotion back to C1, but also victories in the derby with Latina, with whom there is a heated rivalry.[citation needed] Frosinone won both matches 1–0, with goal[quantify] from Manca away and Aquino scoring at home.[citation needed] Upon their return to C1, which saw them travel to such historic[tone] cities as Cremona, Mantua, and Pisa,[relevant?] Frosinone appointed Dino Pagliari as coach, while the likes of[tone] Salvatore Mastronunzio, Di Deo (later sold to Ternana in B), Molinari, Nicola Pagani, Mauro Zaccagnini, goalkeeper Zappino, promoted,[vague][clarification needed][relevant?] Alfredo Cariello, Davide D'Antoni, Francesco Mocarelli, Antonio Di Nardo, Michele Ischia were all signed to bolster the playing squad.[relevant?][citation needed] Famous[tone][according to whom?] men who have played for Frosinone include the sport commentator Sandro Ciotti.[citation needed] The season saw Frosinone go through highs and lows,[tone][vague] in the end finishing fifth and reaching the play-offs, where they were eliminated by Mantova.[citation needed] In the following season, 2005–06, Frosinone were coached by Ivo Iaconi, who had offers from two Serie B teams, Fermana and Pescara, yet opted to manage the Canarini.[citation needed] Several players were signed to help the club in their push for promotion including Ciro Ginestra, Stefano Bellè, Jimmy Fialdini, Paolo Antonioli, Massimo Perra, Marco Martini, Marco Ogliari and Giuseppe Anaclerio.[relevant?][citation needed] Despite the presence of fallen giant[tone][according to whom?] and former Scudetto winners Napoli in the league, Frosinone emerged as strong challengers.[citation needed] They began the season well, with a 4–1 victory at Perugia.[citation needed] Frosinone continued their strong form right throughout the championship, finally finishing second behind Napoli and favourites to win the play-offs.[citation needed] Their first opponents were Tuscan side Sangiovannese, who had finished fifth.[citation needed] Both matches ended scoreless and Frosinone progressed to the final by virtue of their higher placed finish in the league.[citation needed] In the final they met another team from Tuscany, Grosseto, drawing 0–0 at home and winning 1–0 away thanks to a goalkeeping error.[citation needed] For the first time ever, Frosinone were promoted to Serie B.[citation needed] For their first season at Serie B level, the club made several signings to keep the team competitive.[citation needed] They included Massimo Margiotta, Francesco Lodi, Lucas Rimoldi and Fabio Di Venanzio.[citation needed] Meanwhile, work began on restructuring the Stadium Matusa, whose capacity was increased from 5,000 to almost 10,000 seats.[citation needed] The first game of the season was a 1–0 loss away at the Stadio Nereo Rocco against Triestina.[citation needed] This was followed by draws at home against Spezia and Arezzo and another away defeat at Rimini.[citation needed] Their first victory came away

A goal from Alessandro Del Piero (his 200th for Juve) decided the game, however the Frusinati returned home with their heads held high.[tone][citation needed] The season concluded with a draw against Modena, and Frosinone finished 13th, a more than satisfactory[tone] position for their debut season.[citation needed] The Canarini improved on this during their second Serie B season, finishing 10th in 2007–08, and for much of the season were in real[vague][tone] contention for a play-off place and a highly unlikely[tone][according to whom?] promotion to Serie A.[citation needed] On 21 May 2011, the club was relegated from Serie B to Lega Pro Prima Divisione after finishing bottom of the table.[citation needed] On 7 June 2014, Frosinone, under the guidance of head coach Roberto Stellone, was promoted from Lega Pro Prima Divisione to Serie B after winning the playoff 1–1, 3–1 (4–2 aggregate) against Lecce.[citation needed] In the 2014–15 Serie B season, Frosinone quickly emerged as a surprise package[tone] for a Serie A spot, fighting against more renowned[according to whom?] teams such as Vicenza and Bologna for a top flight place.[citation needed] On 16 May 2015, Frosinone won automatic promotion after a 3–1 home win against Crotone, six points ahead of third-placed Bologna with only one game remaining; this meant the club would make its first Serie A appearance in the 2015–16 season. Frosinone's maiden Serie A campaign began in a difficult style,[according to whom?] losing their first four outings[tone] and dropping to bottom place in the table.[citation needed] In Round 5, the club came up against Italian football heavyweights[tone] Juventus at the Juventus Stadium. Defying all odds,[according to whom?] Frosinone came away with a first ever Serie A point, thanks to an equalising last minute Leonardo Blanchard header, to end the match in a 1–1 draw.[citation needed] The following round, Frosinone achieved their first Serie A win, defeating Empoli 2–0 at the Stadio Matusa.[citation needed] Frosinone achieved their second and third consecutive home wins by beating Sampdoria by the same scoreline as in the Empoli game, and then they beat fellow newly promoted side Carpi 2–1.[citation needed] Frosinone Calcio were relegated back to Serie B after one season in Serie A as they finished in 19th place. On 29 May 2017, Frosinone lost the semifinal promotion playoff against Carpi, remaining in Serie B.[citation needed] On 16 June 2018, Frosinone was promoted to Serie A for the second time in their history, defeating Palermo 2–0 at home to win 3–2 on aggregate in the promotion play-off finals after a 2–1 loss in the first leg. They were relegated back to Serie B after one season at top level.[citation needed] In their first season back in Serie B, Frosinone missed out on promotion after losing in the playoff final to Spezia. On 25 May 2019, Frosinone was relegated again after having a bad season,[according to whom?] and on their last matchday they tied 0–0 against Chevo Verona.[spelling?][citation needed] On 19 May 2023, after four years of playing in Serie B, Frosinone were promoted to Serie A after being leaders of Serie B, and winning 3–2 against Ternana on their last matchday, and even[tone] beating Napoli 4–0 in the round of 16 of the Coppa Italia.[citation needed] The first social colours of the club were red and blue.[citation needed] Now[when?] they are yellow and blue. Since the 2007–08 season, the club has had a mascot called Lillo, represented by a lion, the animal that appears in the coat of arms.[citation needed] The name was chosen by fans of Frosinone with a poll on the club's official website. The mascot accompanies the home team, and, from the 2008–09 season, there is also a chance to be selected, on request, to impersonate Lillo for a game.[citation needed] As of 9 February 2024 Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Frosinone has always played its home games at the Stadio Comunale di Frosinone, nicknamed the Matusa because of the age of the structure.[citation needed] Founded in what was then the outskirts of the city, today, as a result of the massive urban growth of the city, it is set in the centre of the capital of Frosinone surrounded by several buildings.[citation needed] It has undergone several reconstructions but never related to the foundational structure of the grandstand, which is still the one from the foundation.[citation needed] Over the years, also depending on the results of the team, it has had different capacities.[citation needed] In 2014 it could accommodate approximately 10,000 spectators.[citation needed] In the eighties the new Stadio Casaleno began to be built in short distance of the area.[citation needed] The progress, which led to the construction of a grandstand, however, was interrupted as a result of scandals and erroneous projects and led to the temporary decline of the team.[citation needed] For several years projects have been proposed to complete the structure and give Frosinone a new stadium, but the idea, as well as complex bureaucratic loopholes and economic issues, has also seen resistance from many fans who prefer to play in the old historic stadium.[citation needed] In 2007, in order to unlock the stalemate that concerned the management of the old Matusa and the construction of the new municipal stadium, some fans of the club, as a provocative gesture, put the stadium up for auction on eBay for a single euro, though in a few hours the bidding price was over €8 million. The record of spectators in a game inside of the Matusa dates back to the Serie C1 championship of 1988–89, with about 12,000 spectators for a match against Campobasso. Starting from October 2017, Frosinone plays its home games at Benito Stirpe stadium.[citation needed] The record number of spectators at a game inside of the Stirpe in Serie B championship of 2017–2018, was about 16,286 spectators for a match against Foggia. In November 2017, Frosinone Calcio launched the first ever public mini-bond investment scheme in Italian football via sports investment platform Tifosy. Frosinone Calcio president Maurizio Stirpe mentions that the proceeds of the mini-bond would be used to: "build the medical center (intended for all those who gravitate around the world of Frosinone Calcio) and the restaurant , both located in the belly of the central grandstand. With the resources that the club aims to collect through crowdfunding the ring around the stadium could also be restructured , with the rebuilding of the flooring, so as to allow citizens who use these spaces to run and train themselves to have a more functional space to these activities". The Frosinone Bond raised €1,500,000 which was €500,000 over what the club initially thought the bond would raise.
