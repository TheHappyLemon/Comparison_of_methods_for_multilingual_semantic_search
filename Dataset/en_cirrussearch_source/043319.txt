With outstanding performances in these competitions, he was awarded the grand prize of the Cha Bum-kun Football Award, given to the best youth footballers in South Korea. After graduating from Singok Elementary School, he entered Pohang Jecheol Middle School and started to play in Pohang Steelers under-15 team, the school's affiliated football club.

During the 2019–20 season, Hwang drew plaudits alongside Salzburg's attacking players Erling Haaland and Takumi Minamino. The trio were particularly praised for their exploits in the Champions League, where Hwang was involved in eight goals by recording three goals and three assists, and winning two penalty kicks. His playing style was described as energetic with accurate passing and an eye for dribbling. In all competitions, Hwang had a remarkable season, scoring 16 goals and providing 22 assists in 40 appearances. On 8 July 2020, Hwang signed for RB Leipzig on a five-year contract. On 12 September, he scored a goal and created an assist against Nürnberg in the first round of the 2020–21 DFB-Pokal, where he made his debut.

On 29 August 2021, Hwang joined Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers on a season long loan. On 11 September, Hwang scored Wolves' second goal away to Watford on his debut as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 win. He then got his first goals at Molineux on 2 October, as he scored both goals in Wolves' 2–1 win against Newcastle United, both strikes coming from similarly tight angles. On 26 January 2022, the club announced that they had activated a clause in his loan deal that would see him join the club on a permanent deal on 1 July 2022, upon the expiration of his loan, signing a contract until 2026. He scored five goals in his debut campaign in the Premier League. Hwang scored his first FA Cup goal away to Liverpool in the third round of the competition on 7 January 2023, his strike tying the game at 2–2. Wolves then had a third goal disallowed in controversial circumstances, the game ultimately finishing all square.

On 28 October 2023, Hwang scored Wolves's second goal in a 2–2 home draw with Newcastle United, meaning he became the first Wolves player since Derek Dougan, fifty years previously, to score six goals in the first ten games of a top-flight season. On 21 December 2023, Hwang signed a new long-term contract with Wolves, keeping him at the club until 2028 with an option for a further year. On 27 December, he scored a brace in a 4–1 away win over Brentford, becoming the third Wolves player to score at least 10 Premier League goals in one season, following Raúl Jiménez and Steven Fletcher. In the 2012 AFC U-16 Championship, South Korea was eliminated in the quarter-finals, but Hwang became the top scorer of the tournament with five goals including a hat-trick against North Korea. Hwang participated in the 2016 Summer Olympics and scored a goal in a group match against Germany, which finished in a 3–3 draw. In a friendly on 28 March 2018, Hwang scored South Korea's second goal against Poland, with the match ending in a 2–3 loss. Hwang represented South Korea in the under-23 team at the 2018 Asian Games where he scored the second and winning goal for South Korea in the 2–1 final against Japan, a goal assisted by Son Heung-min. The tournament win guaranteed Hwang and his teammates exemption from mandatory military service. In the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Hwang started in South Korea's first two matches against Sweden and Mexico. He was criticized for not converting a scoring chance against Sweden. He was substituted in for Koo Ja-cheol in the 2–0 victory against Germany, but was brought off after only 20 minutes for Go Yo-han. After the tournament, manager Shin Tae-yong expressed remorse for taking off Hwang and explained that it was a tactical decision as Hwang was struggling to help the team on defense. In the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Hwang scored the winning goal in stoppage time against Portugal to secure a 2–1 win, which helped South Korea advance to the Round of 16, where they were eliminated by Brazil following a 4–1 defeat on 5 December.
