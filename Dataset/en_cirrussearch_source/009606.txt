Konstantin Aleksandrovich Glazachev (Russian: Константин Александрович Глазачев; born February 18, 1985) is a Russian former ice hockey forward. He most recently played for Admiral Vladivostok in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Glazachev moved to Yaroslavl at a young age and is a product of the HC Lokomotiv hockey system. The young player was also consistently a member of Russia's both U18 and U20 national squads. The young player was drafted by the Nashville Predators early in the second round with the 35th overall selection of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. Since the draft he has consistently skated in the former Russian Super League and the current Kontinental Hockey League, but has struggled to build on the success he enjoyed earlier in his career.
