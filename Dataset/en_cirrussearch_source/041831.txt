He started his career as a right-back, but he often plays as a winger. Rezaeian was Carlos Queiroz's first choice on the right side of the defence of the Iran men's national team in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. Known for his great speed, agility, and athleticism, he is often regarded as one of Iran's best ever fullbacks. Rezaeian was born in Semes Kandeh-ye Olya, a village in Sari County, Mazanderan. Rezaeian played his entire career for Saba Qom before signing for Rah Ahan in 2013. He made 98 appearances for the club scoring seven goals. Rezaeian signed a three–year with the Tehran-based club Rah Ahan in 2013. After several good performances in the 2014–15 season, Rezaeian was recognized as one of the best fullbacks in the league and was called up to the national team. On 3 April 2015, Rezaeian scored his team's first goal in a 2–2 draw against Persepolis. Two weeks later, on 17 April, he scored a brace in a 2–2 draw against Esteghlal Khuzestan.

After a few weeks, his contract was eventually terminated with Persepolis and he was released. After rejecting an offer from Tehran rivals Esteghlal F.C., Rezaeian joined Belgian club K.V.
