Bangka Belitung is ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse; major ethnic groups including Malays, Chinese and Javanese. Indonesian is the official language, while the local Malay dialect and Hakka serves as the lingua franca of the province. Historically, Bangka Belitung has been part of the kingdoms of Sriwijaya, Majapahit and Palembang, before becoming a colony of foreign empires (Dutch, British and Japanese). Bangka Belitung was a residency within the Dutch East Indies. Upon the independence of Indonesia, the region was administered as part of the province of Sumatra and subsequently of South Sumatra. Bangka Belitung officially became the 31st province of Indonesia in 2000. The name "Bangka" is derived from the word wangka (वन्च, 'vanca') meaning "tin" in Sanskrit, because this region is indeed rich in tin mining. The name "Wangka" first appeared along with the name "Swarnabhumi" in the Indian literary book Milindrapantha from the 1st Century BC. Swarnabhumi is identified as the island of Sumatra, the strong allegation that the so-called "Wangka" is the island of Bangka. Louis-Charles Damais, in his book Epigraphy and History of the Nusantara, affirms that Bangka comes from the word vowel (vanca). The name "Belitung" is derived from Billitonite meaning the Black Meteorite in Dutch, which is commonly found in the island of Belitung. This stone itself was discovered at the time of tin mining in Belitung. Later on, Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications began named the island Billitonite or Billiton. Nowadays, Billitonite or Black Meteorite, is a distinct souvenir from Belitung Island.

Just like other provinces in Indonesia, Bangka Belitung were European and Japanese colonies. Prior to the colonial era, Bangka Belitung was part the Sriwijaya and Majapahit kingdoms who settled Bangka Belitung to expand their power. The first Europeans arrived in Bangka was the British on 20 May 1812. However, with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, the British left Bangka Belitung, and the Dutch took over. Due to the agreement, the Dutch were able to take control of the Pacific Islands. However, there was a coup attempt by local elite through Depati Barin and his son Depati Amir causing a war from 1849 to 1851 to oppose the colonization in Bangka Belitung, the war was won by the Dutch and Depati Amir was exiled to Kupang in East Nusa Tenggara. Depati Amir was memorialized as a national hero and his name was remembered through its regional airport, the Depati Amir Airport. During WWII, the Empire of Japan briefly occupied the region. Following the surrender of Japan and the end of the war, the islands become part of an independent Indonesia. Bangka Belitung has a long history of Chinese in-migration, mainly Hakka. Chinese people in the 13th century had started to migrate into the Bangka region. In the 17th century, the rulers of Palembang saw there was extraordinary potential and later they founded tin mines in Belitung. The tin mine was the main reason the Dutch decided to bring contract workers from mainland China, resettling in Belitung. The tin helped drive the island's development and make it the place it is today. Since then, some of the Chinese migrants returned to china while others decided to stay. The ones who decided to stay began assimilating with local people and this was followed by intermarriages. They live peacefully in spite of differences in religion and ethnicity. When anti-Chinese riots occurred in some parts of Indonesia at the end of the Suharto regime in 1998, the locals and those of Chinese descent were not much concerned and still lived peacefully in the Bangka Belitung province.

Bangka Island and Belitung Island were originally inhabited by the Orang Laut, over the course of a long history formed by the process of culture and acculturation. The Orang Laut themselves came from various islands. Sea people from Belitung sailed and inhabited the coast along the Malay Peninsula, then returned to Bangka Island and Belitung Island, while those who lived in the Riau Islands sailed to Bangka. There are also groups of Orang Laut from Sulawesi and Kalimantan. In the next wave, the Bugis, who were originally from South Sulawesi, came and settled in Bangka, Belitung and Riau. Then came the Johor Malay, Siantan Malay, Malay-Chinese, and also native Chinese, mingling during the process of acculturation and culture. Finally came the Minangkabau, Javanese, Banjarese, Madurese, Acehnese and some other ethnic groups. The Malay is the largest ethnic group in the province. They form around 52.5% of the total population. The Malays are mostly concentrated around the interior of Bangka and Belitung. The Malay are divided into the Bangka Malay and the Belitung Malay.

The second largest ethnic group is the Chinese, forming around 29.1% of the total population. The Chinese are mostly concentrated in the coastal part of Bangka and Belitung or urban areas. The Chinese in Bangka Belitung were originally from Southern China, especially from the Guangdong province, migrating from the 18th century to the early 20th century to have better job opportunities. During the colonial era, most of the Chinese worked in the mining industry as well as making their own businesses. Most of the Chinese in Bangka Belitung are Hakka, while significant Hokkien and Cantonese communities also exist. The Chinese culture in Bangka is slightly different from the Chinese in Belitung. The Chinese in Bangka were imported in the early 18th century when the mine was officially opened. They generally did not bring their wives and thus married indigenous people, so the Chinese in Bangka are mostly peranakans who speak the Hakka Language mixed with Malay. Belitung Chinese are considered "totok" ("full-blooded") because when they came in the 19th century they brought their wives. They adapted to the culture of the archipelago, among others, by changing their clothing into local clothing such as clothes with kebaya kurung or sarong. They still speak with the original Hakka language spoken in China today.
