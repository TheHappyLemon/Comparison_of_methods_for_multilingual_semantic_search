Avar (–º–∞–≥”è–∞—Ä—É–ª –º–∞—Ü”è, ma«•arul mac º [ma ïarul matÕ°s º], "language of the mountains" or –∞–≤–∞—Ä –º–∞—Ü”è, awar mac º [awar matÕ°s º], "Avar language"), also known as Avaric, is a Northeast Caucasian language of the Avar‚ÄìAndic subgroup that is spoken by Avars, primarily in Dagestan. In 2010, there were approximately 1 million speakers in Dagestan and elsewhere in Russia. It is spoken mainly in the western and southern parts of the Russian Caucasus republic of Dagestan, and the Balaken, Zaqatala regions of north-western Azerbaijan. Some Avars live in other regions of Russia. There are also small communities of speakers living in the Russian republics of Chechnya and Kalmykia; in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Jordan, and the Marmara Sea region of Turkey. It is spoken by about 1,200,000 people worldwide. UNESCO classifies Avar as vulnerable to extinction. It is one of six literary languages of Dagestan, where it is spoken not only by the Avar, but also serves as the language of communication between different ethnic and linguistic groups. Glottolog lists 14 dialects of Avar, some of which correspond to the villages where they are spoken. The dialects are listed in alphabetical order based on their name in Glottolog: Ancux (Antsukh / –ê–Ω—Ü—É—Ö) Andalal-Gxdatl Bacadin Batlux Hid Karax Kaxib Keleb Salatav Shulanin Untib Xunzax (Khunzakh / X—É–Ω–∑–∞—Ö) Zakataly Zaqatala There are competing analyses of the distinction transcribed in the table with the length sign ‚ü®Àê‚ü©. Length is part of the distinction, but so is articulatory strength, so they have been analyzed as fortis and lenis.[citation needed] The fortis affricates are long in the fricative part of the contour, e.g. [tsÀê] (tss), not in the stop part as in geminate affricates in languages such as Japanese and Italian [tÀês] (tts). Laver (1994) analyzes e.g. [tÕ°…¨Àê] as a two-segment affricate‚Äìfricative sequence [tÕ°…¨…¨] (/têûõ…¨/ = /t…¨…¨/). Avar has five phonemic vowels: /a e i o u/. In Avar, accent is contrastive, free and mobile, independent of the number of syllables in the word. Changes in lexical accent placement indicate different semantic meaning and grammatical meanings of a word: —Ä–∞ÃÅ–≥”è–∏ 'word' ~ —Ä–∞–≥”è–∏ÃÅ 'fodder' —Ä—ÉÃÅ–≥—ä–Ω–∞–ª 'wound.nom.pl' ~ —Ä—É–≥—ä–Ω–∞ÃÅ–ª 'wound.gen.sg' Avar is an agglutinative language, of SOV order. Adverbs do not inflect, outside of inflection for noun class in some adverbs of place: e.g. the /b/ in / íani-b/ "inside" and /tÕ°se-b-e/ "in front". Adverbs of place also distinguish locative, allative, and ablative forms suffixally, such as / íani-b/ "inside", / íani-b-e/ "to the inside", and / íani-sa/ "from the inside". /-go/ is an emphatic suffix taken by underived adjectives. There were some attempts to write the Avar language in the Georgian alphabet as early as the 14th century. The use of Arabic script for representing Avar in marginal glosses began in the 15th century. The use of Arabic, which is known as ajam, is still known today. As part of Soviet language re-education policies in 1928 the Ajam was replaced by a Latin alphabet, which in 1938 was in turn replaced by the current Cyrillic script. Essentially, it is the Russian alphabet plus one additional letter called palochka (stick, ”Ä). As that letter cannot be typed with common keyboard layouts, it is often replaced with a capital Latin letter i ( I ), small Latin letter L ( l ), or the numerical digit 1. The Avar language is usually written in the Cyrillic script. The letters of the alphabet are (with their pronunciation given below in IPA transcription): Compiled according to: One feature of Avar Arabic script is that similar to alphabets succh as Uyghyr and Kurdish, the script does not omit vowels and does not rely on diacritics to represent vowels when need be. Instead, modified letters with dot placement and accents have been standardized to represent vowels. Thus, Avar Arabic script is no longer an "impure abjad" unlike its parent systems (Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman), it now resembles a proper "alphabet". While this was not the case for most of the several centuries during which Arabic alphabet has been used for Avar, this has become the case in the latest and most common conventions. This was indeed not the case at the time of writing of a linguistic article for the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1881. As an example, in Avar Arabic Script, four varieties of the letter yƒÅ º ("€å") have been developed, each with a distinct function. Nevertheless, Avar Arabic script does retain two diacritics. First is "shadda" (ŸÄŸëŸÄ), used for gemination. While in Cyrillic, two back to back letters, including digraphs are written, in Arabic script, shadda is used. Second diacritic in use in Avar Arabic script is ·∏çammah (ŸÄŸèŸÄ). In Arabic, Persian, and historically in Ottoman Turkish, this diacritic is used to represent [o] or [u]. But in Avar, this diacritic is used for labialization [‚óå ∑] and not for any sort of vowel. So, it is the case that this diacritic is used in conjunction with a follow-up vowel. For example, the sound "–∑–≤–∞" [z ∑a] is written as "ÿ≤Ÿèÿß". This diacritic can optionally be used in conjunction with shadda. For example, the sound "—Å—Å–≤a" [sÀê ∑a] is written as "ÿ≥ŸèŸëÿß". If a word starts with a vowel, if it's an [a] sound, it is written with alif "ÿß". Otherwise, the vowel needs to be preceded by a "vowel carrier", which is hamza-ya' (ÿ¶ŸÄ). No need for such a carrier in the middle of words. Below table demonstrates vowels in Avar Arabic Script. The literary language is based on the –±–æ–ª–º–∞—Ü”è (bolmac º)[citation needed]‚Äîbo = "army" or "country", and mac º = "language"‚Äîthe common language used between speakers of different dialects and languages. The bolmac º in turn was mainly derived from the dialect of Khunzakh, the capital and cultural centre of the Avar region, with some influence from the southern dialects. Nowadays the literary language is influencing the dialects, levelling out their differences.[citation needed] The most famous figure of modern Avar literature is Rasul Gamzatov (died November 3, 2003), the People's Poet of Dagestan. Translations of his works into Russian have gained him a wide audience all over the former Soviet Union.[citation needed] Russia portal Languages portal Northeast Caucasian languages Languages of the Caucasus Avar at Ethnologue (25th ed., 2022) Old Avar at Ethnologue (25th ed., 2022) "Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: ava".
