Estadio La Cartuja (Spanish pronunciation: [esˈta.ðjo la kaɾˈtu.xa]), formerly Estadio Olímpico de Sevilla, officially known as Estadio La Cartuja de Sevilla, is a multi-purpose stadium situated in the Isla de la Cartuja in Seville, Spain. It is used mostly for football and it is commonly referred to as simply 'La Cartuja'. It was completed in 1999 for the World Championships in Athletics. With a capacity of 57,619 seats, La Cartuja is the 5th-largest stadium in Spain and the 2nd-largest in Andalusia. It was the venue for the 2003 UEFA Cup final between Celtic and Porto. The stadium was one of those included in the Seville bids for the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics. After the failure of the last bid, the stadium remained unused by either of Seville's major football teams as both Real Betis and Sevilla use their own stadia. However, both teams have expressed their intention to move temporarily while their respective home grounds are renovated. The stadium is currently managed by the Sociedad Estadio Olímpico de Sevilla S.A., participated by the Regional Government of Andalusia (40% ownership), the Spanish Government (25%); Seville City Council (19%), Seville Congress of Deputies (13%) and the remaining 3% shared evenly between Seville's two football clubs: Real Betis and Sevilla FC. The Spain national football team occasionally use the stadium for home games, last playing there in 2021. The stadium has previously hosted the final of the Copa del Rey. Real Betis's home game against Villarreal on 31 March 2007 also took place here following a temporary ban from the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera. The Royal Spanish Tennis Federation has chosen it twice to host the Davis Cup final, in 2004 and 2011. On both occasions a temporary roof was installed on one side of the stadium, where the clay court was placed. On 5 February 2020, the stadium was chosen by the Royal Spanish Football Federation to host four Copa del Rey finals from 2020 to 2023. On 23 April 2021 it was announced that the stadium would replace San Mamés Stadium in Bilbao as a host stadium for UEFA Euro 2020, which was unable to fulfill its original hosting duties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the tournament, and as part of the UEFA Festival, Seville was illuminated at night with a light show across the cityscape. It could host matches for the 2030 FIFA World Cup. The stadium was one of three selected to host the 2024 UEFA Women's Nations League Finals matches. It hosted 2 matches.
