The ATP Masters events, known as ATP Masters 1000 tournaments since 2009, are an annual series of nine tennis tournaments featuring the top-ranked players on the ATP Tour since its inception in 1990. The Masters tournaments, sitting below the Grand Slam tournaments and the year-end championships, make up the most coveted trophies on the annual ATP Tour calendar. In addition to the quadrennial Summer Olympics, they are collectively known as the 'Big Titles'. Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most Masters singles titles with 40. By completing the career set of all nine Masters singles titles in 2018, Djokovic became the first and only player to achieve the career Golden Masters. In 2020, Djokovic completed a second career Golden Masters. In doubles, the Bryan brothers (Bob and Mike) won a record 39 doubles titles as a team. Daniel Nestor and the Bryan brothers are the only doubles players to achieve the career Golden Masters. The Masters series was introduced in 1990 with the inception of the ATP Tour by bringing together the nine most prestigious tournaments of the preceding Grand Prix tennis circuit. Results in ATP Masters events earn players more ranking points than regular tournaments but less than Grand Slam events or the year-end ATP Finals. Up until 2007, most Masters finals were contested as best-of-five-set matches, but from 2008 all events were decided in best-of-three-set matches. As part of a shake-up of the tennis circuit in 2009, the Masters Series became the ATP Tour Masters 1000, with the addition of the number 1000 referring to the number of ranking points earned by the winner of each tournament. Contrary to earlier plans, the number of tournaments was not reduced from nine to eight and the Monte-Carlo Masters remained part of the series although, unlike the other events, it does not have a mandatory player commitment. The Hamburg Masters event was downgraded to an ATP Tour 500 event. The Madrid Masters moved to May and onto clay courts. A new tournament in Shanghai replaced the Hamburg Masters and took over Madrid's former October indoor slot. In 2011, six of the nine Masters level tournaments were combined ATP and WTA events. 1990–1995; ATP Championship Series, Single Week 1996–1999; ATP Super 9 2000–2003; Tennis Masters Series 2004–2008; ATP Masters Series 2009–2018; ATP World Tour Masters 1000 2019–present; ATP Masters 1000 ATP Points (as of 2024) As the ATP Masters Series (2004–2008), winners were awarded 500 points and finalists were awarded 350 points. Players with byes losing their first match receive first round points. Currently, the following nine tournaments are part of the ATP Masters 1000: Canadian Open (alternating yearly between Montreal and Toronto), Italian Open (held in Rome), Indian Wells Open, Miami Open, Monte-Carlo Masters, Madrid Open, Cincinnati Open, Shanghai Masters and Paris Masters. Since 2009, five of the tournaments have been held on outdoor hard courts, three on clay and one on indoor hard court, whereas from 1990 until 2008 there were two indoor tournaments at the top-9 level. In 2009, the Shanghai Masters replaced the Madrid Open, which was until then held as an indoor event, in the eighth slot of the year with the Madrid Open switched to clay courts, replacing the Hamburg Open in the spring clay court season. The Shanghai Masters was designated as an outdoor event despite the facility having a retractable roof and having been used as the indoor venue for the ATP Finals from 2005 until 2008. Other than Hamburg, the tournaments defunct between 1990 and 2009 were Stockholm (1990–1994) and Stuttgart (1995–2001), which were held as indoor events in the eighth slot. The Monte-Carlo Masters, despite its name, is held in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, not in Monaco. Madrid Masters was played in the Madrid Arena on an indoor hardcourt from 2002 to 2008. The men's Canadian Open is held in Montreal in even-numbered years and Toronto in odd-numbered years, alternating with the women's event.
