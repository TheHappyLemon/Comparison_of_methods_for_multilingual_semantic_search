Unione Sportiva Cremonese, commonly referred to as Cremonese, is an Italian football club based in Cremona, Lombardy, which plays in the Serie B following their relegation from the top flight in the 2022–23 season. Cremonese was in the Serie A in its first season, 1929–30, but entered a long period of decline, playing in the lower leagues before the late 1970s. By 1984, they had achieved promotion to Serie A, with one-year spells in 1984–85, 1989–90 and 1991–92. Cremonese had a more successful run in the 1992–93 Anglo-Italian Cup, beating Bari 4–1 in the semi-final, and Derby County 3–1 in the final at the old Wembley Stadium. Cremonese's scorers were Corrado Verdelli, Riccardo Maspero and Andrea Tentoni, with Derby's goal scored by Marco Gabbiadini. Under Luigi Simoni, Cremonese returned to Serie A in the 1993–94 season. With defenders Luigi Gualco and Corrado Verdelli, midfield playmaker Riccardo Maspero, and forwards Andrea Tentoni and Matjaž Florijančič, Cremonese played Serie A with a 10th-place finish in 1993–94, but would be relegated in the 1995–96 season. Relegation resulted in the club moving down to Serie C2 by 2000 and remaining in mid-table positions for four years, before achieving promotion back into Serie C1 and then Serie B for the 2005-2006 season. Giovanni Dall'Igna, another defender from the Serie A years, returned to the club. However, Cremonese were relegated to Serie C1 in the 2005–06 season. Cremonese have tried to return to Serie B since. In the 2009–10 season they were beaten by Varese in the promotion play-off final (2–1 on aggregate). Eventually they succeeded in 2017. In the 2021–22 Serie B, Cremonese finished second to earn promotion to the 2022–23 Serie A. Despite achieving promotion, coach Fabio Pecchia resigned from his post.
