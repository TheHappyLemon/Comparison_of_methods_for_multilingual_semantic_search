"The Gnome" is a song by the English rock band Pink Floyd. Written by Syd Barrett, it is the eighth song on their 1967 debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. The song takes place in a fictional gnome world from the perspective of a gnome. The song tells the tale of a scarlet tunic wearing gnome named Grimble Gromble. The lyrics ostensibly "came off the top [of Barrett's] head". "The Gnome" was included on the B-side of the US Pink Floyd single "Flaming" (Tower 378), which was never released in the UK.
