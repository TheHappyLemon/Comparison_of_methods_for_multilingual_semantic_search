Nizhny Tagil (Russian: Нижний Тагил, IPA: [ˈnʲiʐnʲɪj tɐˈgʲil]) is a city in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia, located 25 kilometers (16 mi) east of the boundary between Asia and Europe. Population: 338,966 (2021 Census); 361,811 (2010 Census); 390,498 (2002 Census); 439,521 (1989 Census). The history of Nizhny Tagil dates back to the mid-16th century, when the Stroganovs received the right to possess land by the Kama and Chusovaya basins. In 1579 they founded the first settlement, the Utkin sloboda, by the river Utka, the mouth of Chusoya. Fateyevo, the first Russian village in the Tagil region, was founded in 1665. In 1696, by the order of Tsar Peter the Great, the Vysokogorsky iron ore quarry was opened. Voevode Dmitry Protasyev was elected to search for iron and magnetic ores. The deposits were particularly rich, and included lodes of pure magnetic iron. The surrounding landscape provided everything needed for a successful and productive mining and smelting operation — rivers for transport, forests for fuel, and suitable climate. Several years later, the Tsar introduced in Russia a special administration on mining. Over the following decades, the city developed as one of the early centers of Russian industrialization, and it has been a major producer of cast iron and steel. The town of Nizhny Tagil, home of the factory Uralvagonzavod, is also known for its production of Soviet tanks, including the famous T-34; nearly every other T-34 was manufactured in Nizhny Tagil. The first Russian steam locomotive was constructed there in 1833, and the father-and-son engineers who developed it, Yefim and Miron Cherepanov (Черепанов), were in 1956 commemorated by an 8-meter (26 ft) bronze statue (executed by sculptor A. S. Kondratyev and architect A. V. Sotnikov) which stands in the center of the Theatrical Square in the heart of downtown. According to some sources, the copper for the skin of the Statue of Liberty was mined and refined in Nizhny Tagil. However, research by Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, USA, suggests that the Visnes mine in Norway is the most likely source. Rivers and ponds take up one third of the city's territory. Nizhny Tagil spans 22 kilometers (14 mi) from north to south and 21 kilometers (13 mi) from east to west. The altitude of the city varies from 170 to 380 meters (560 to 1,250 ft). The city is built around the extinct volcano Lisya Mountain. This mountain with a watchtower on its top is a symbol of the city. Another hill, Medved-Kamen [ru], is located in the northern part of the city at an altitude of 288 meters (945 ft). Neighboring cities include Yekaterinburg 130 kilometers (81 mi) to the south, Serov and Priobye in the north, Perm in the west, and Alapayevsk and Verkhnyaya Salda in the east.[citation needed] The city features a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfc) with mildly warm summers and very long and cold winters. Precipitation is mostly concentrated between late spring and early fall, peaking in the months of July and August. A freeze has been recorded for every month of the year. Within the framework of the administrative divisions, Nizhny Tagil serves as the administrative center of Prigorodny District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with twenty-three rural localities, incorporated separately as the City of Nizhny Tagil—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Nizhny Tagil is incorporated as Nizhny Tagil Urban Okrug. The city is divided into three city districts: Leninsky, encompassing the city center and Nizhnetagilsky Pond; Tagilstroyevsky, a comparatively small section at the north part of town; and Dzerzhinsky, a sizable section to the east of the city center principally consisting of apartment buildings and other residences.[citation needed] The city is governed by four local authorities: The Nizhny Tagil City Duma (city council) The Mayor of Nizhny Tagil The Administration of Nizhny Tagil The Audit Chamber of Nizhny Tagil The city's government structure was defined in the charter of a municipal unit, which was passed on 24 November 2005. The city's highest official is the mayor elected by the population of Nizhny Tagil for a term of 5 years in office. The executive is foremost the Administration of Nizhny Tagil, the head of which is the mayor. The legislature agency is the City Duma (city council), composed of 28 deputies, which are chosen via MPP for a term of 5 years in office. Former mayors: Nikolay Didenko 2006-? Valentina Isayeva 2008-? Sergey Nosov 2012-? In 2015, a large portion of the land within the bounds of the city is dominated by the facilities of the factories located in this industrial city. Nizhny Tagil is an industrial center of the Middle Urals. Highly power-intensive industries such as ferrous metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, and metal working are well-developed in the city.

It is the largest main battle tank manufacturer in the world. The T-72, T-90, and T-14 are produced in the city. As of 2016 an economic slowdown in Russia had resulted in diminished demand for civilian products such as train cars, but strong demand continued for tanks. There are resources to manufacture medical tools for traumatology at the Nizhny Tagil medical tools plant.[citation needed] Nizhny Tagil is one of centers of exhibition activity in the Middle Urals. Nizhny Tagil Institute of Metals Testing was the host of the international exhibitions such as Ural Expo Arms / Russian Expo Arms, Russian Defense Expo (2001 and 2002). The 42nd Rocket Division of Strategic Rocket Forces is based in Nizhny Tagil, equipped with 36 Topol nuclear missiles.[citation needed] The House of Demidov's initiatives in the area of culture helped to develop the Tagil community into the Urals' most important cultural center. In the 19th century, a library and the museum of natural history and antiquity were opened. The city has a network of approximately 24 libraries servicing 75,000 readers every year.[citation needed] Tagil museums include the old regional history museum, the museum of Fine Arts, and a number of new museums opened in the 1990s: the museum of tray painting art, the museum of lifestyle and handicrafts representing the starting point of a new ethnographic complex.[citation needed] The Demidov Park, a new cultural and historical project, is planned to be built in the city. However, due to European sanctions against Russia, its foundation has been postponed. Nizhny Tagil has been chosen to host international Urals' Industrial Heritage conferences and workshops. In 2003, during the 12th International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage, a charter was signed for the conservation of Russian industrial heritage.
