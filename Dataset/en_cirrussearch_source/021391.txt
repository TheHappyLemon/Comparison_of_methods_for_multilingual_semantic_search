It is located in the eastern part of the country on the territory of Rēzekne Municipality, the water area of the lake is divided between Kaunatas, Mākoņkalna and Čornajas parishes. It is located in the central part of the Latgale Upland at an altitude of 163.3 m (536 ft) above sea level.

There are 10 islands on the lake with a total area of 24.6 hectares (61 acres), the largest of them is Apshu (9 hectares). In the late 80s - early 90s, the Committee for Environmental Protection drew attention to the deterioration of the ecological state of the lake. In 1999, funds were allocated for a project to create a nature park based on the lake. In 2001, local governments signed a protocol proposing the creation of the Rāzna National Park. In 2004, the official establishment of the Razna Natural Park takes place, which on January 1, 2007 will be transformed into the Rāzna National Park. The lake is home to northern pike, stickleback, stone loach, european eel, tench, sander, perch, roach, peled, carp, crucian carp, common bleak, common bream, common rudd, vendace, ide, ruff, blicca bjoerkna and some other fish species.
