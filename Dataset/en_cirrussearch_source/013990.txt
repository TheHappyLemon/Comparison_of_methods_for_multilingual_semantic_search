Tanel Kangert (born 11 March 1987) is an Estonian former road bicycle racer, who competed as a professional from 2008 to 2022. Kangert was born in Vändra, Estonia. He attended kindergarten alongside fellow Estonian cyclist Rein Taaramäe. Kangert signed his first professional contract with Ag2r–La Mondiale in 2008, after riding with the team as a stagiaire in the 2007 season. In the same year, he finished first in the Estonian National Time Trial Championships. However, during 2008 he also suffered from severe pain in both of his knees, requiring surgery to allow them to move more naturally. This forced him to race as an amateur during the 2010 season. In 2011, Kangert signed for the Kazakh team Astana. In 2012, he won the final stage of the Tour de Suisse, beating Jérémy Roy in a sprint after the pair had attacked from a breakaway group earlier in the race. In the same year, he also won the Estonian National Road Race Championships. Kangert was one of Vincenzo Nibali's main domestiques in the 2013 Giro d'Italia, finishing in 14th position himself, after which it was announced he would sign a 3-year extension to his contract at Astana. In 2016, Kangert finished second in the Giro del Trentino, two seconds behind Mikel Landa, after winning the final stage. In October of the same year, he won the Abu Dhabi Tour ahead of Nicolas Roche. Kangert signed for American outfit EF Education First for the 2019 season. He signed for Team BikeExchange on a two-year contract for the 2021 season, in support of Simon Yates who had recently extended his contract with the team. 2004 10th Overall Course de la Paix juniors 2005 1st Overall Course de la Paix juniors 3rd Overall Liège–La Gleize 2006 6th Overall Tour des Pyrénées 2007 1st Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships 1st Overall Tour du Gévaudan Languedoc-Roussillon 1st Stage 3 2nd Kreiz Breizh Elites 3rd Riga Grand Prix 7th Time trial, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 8th Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 9th Overall Les 3 Jours de Vaucluse 10th Coppa Placci 2008 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 4th Boucles de l'Aulne 2010 National Road Championships 1st Time trial 2nd Road race 1st Tartu GP 2011 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 2012 National Road Championships 1st Road race 2nd Time trial 1st Stage 9 Tour de Suisse 2013 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Vuelta a España 5th Grand Prix of Aargau Canton 6th Overall Tour de Suisse 9th Overall Tour de Pologne 2014 5th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 9th Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 2016 1st Overall Abu Dhabi Tour 1st Stage 3 2nd Overall Giro del Trentino 1st Stages 1 (TTT), 3 & 4 6th Vuelta a Murcia 9th Road race, Olympic Games 2018 1st Time trial, National Road Championships Combativity award Stage 17 Tour de France 2019 7th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 2020 2nd Faun-Ardèche Classic 4th Overall Tour des Alpes-Maritimes et du Var 8th Overall Paris–Nice 9th La Drôme Classic 2021 6th Overall Tour of Slovenia 2022 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships 10th Time trial, UEC European Road Championships "EF Education First Pro Cycling".
