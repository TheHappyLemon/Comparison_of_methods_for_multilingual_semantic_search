Paropsis charybdis, commonly known as the Eucalyptus tortoise beetle, is a species of leaf beetle belonging to the genus Paropsis. It is considered a pest of some species of Eucalyptus. Paropsis charybdis is identified by its pale creamy-white elytra upon which are three broad transverse areas of darker colouration. The under surface is yellow-brown. Paropsis charybdis is native to Australia, but has spread to nearby New Zealand. The parasitoid wasps Ennogera nassaui and Eadya paropsidis have been used as a biological control agent for P. charybdis. Paropsis charybdis is the most serious defoliater of eucalyptus in New Zealand and is particularly associated with the subgenus Symphyomyrtus. The most severely attacked species include: E. globulus, E. viminalis, E. johnstonii, E. smithii, E. grandis, E. deanei, E. guilfoylei, E. macarthurii, E. longifolia, and E. quadrangulata.
