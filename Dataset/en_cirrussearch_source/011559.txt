4TP, otherwise known as PZInż 140, was a Polish light tank prototype. It was designed by 16 December 1936 by Edward Habich of the Państwowe Zakłady Inżynieryjne works. A light reconnaissance tank, it was to become a heavier replacement for TK-3 and TKS tankettes in Polish service. In addition to light, manoeuvrable chassis, the tank was to feature a turret with one 20 mm nkm wz. 38 FK autocannon and one Ckm wz. 30 machine gun. Only a single prototype was built. Extensively tested by the army, it proved a reliable vehicle. However, the army decided that by the time serial production could start, the design would already be outdated, and no serial production followed. "4TP - polski lekki czołg rozpoznawczy". derela.pl.
