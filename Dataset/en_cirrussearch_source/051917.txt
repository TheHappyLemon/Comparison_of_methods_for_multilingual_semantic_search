The Rødovre Mighty Bulls is a Danish professional ice hockey team based in Rødovre, Denmark, playing in the Metal Ligaen, the top tier of Danish ice hockey. The club was founded in 1961 and play their home games in the Rødovre Skøjte Arena which has a capacity of 3,600 spectators. The club has won the Danish championship 6 times in 1978, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1990 and 1999. From 1977 to 1979, the team was coached by Boris Kulagin, the former coach of the Soviet national ice hockey team. Kulagin joined the Danish team after getting fired as head coach of the Soviet national team following a disappointing 3rd-place finish at the 1977 World Ice Hockey Championships. Rødovre had used contacts at the Soviet Embassy in Copenhagen, asking them to find a suitable coach for the team. Much to their surprise, they received the famous World Championship winning coach. The fact that such a high level coach was sent to coach in the then lowly Danish league was seen by many as an additional form of punishment for the poor result at the 1977 World Championships. Under Kulagin's guidance, the team won their first Danish title in 1978.   5 Tommy Pedersen   29 Jannik Stæhr Tommy Pedersen Bent Hansen Valeri Bragin Kim "Musen" Andersen Olaf Eller Anatoli Chistyakov Jesper Duus Karsten Arvidsen Juha Riihijärvi Michael Smidt Christian Larrivée Jeremy Stevenson Patrice Lefebvre Morten Madsen Jannik Hansen Mikkel Bødker Lars Eller Mads Bødker Sebastian Dahm Players in bold are NHL alumni. 1978 1983 1985 1986 1990 1999 "Rødovre Mighty Bulls".
