Bouaké (or Bwake, N’ko: ߓߐ߰ߞߍ߫ Bɔ̀ɔkɛ́) is the second-largest city in Ivory Coast, with a population of 740,000 (2021 census). It is the seat of three levels of subdivision—Vallée du Bandama District, Gbêkê Region, and Bouaké Department. The city is located in the central part of Ivory Coast about 50 kilometres (31 mi) northeast of Lake Kossou, the country's largest lake. It is approximately 350 kilometres (220 mi) north of Abidjan on the Abidjan-Niger Railway and about 100 kilometres (62 mi) northeast of Yamoussoukro, the capital of the country. For the name of the city Bouaké, there are two possible origins: The corruption of the chief name Kwa Gbéké that made the foundations of the city of Bouaké. The name Bouaké coming from two Baoulé words: "Boua" which means sheep and "Ké" which means dry. Thus meaning the place in which sheep are dried as they would have seen Jola drying sheep skins when they arrived in Bouaké. In the 1800s a group related to the Akan, the Assabou and Baoulé settled in the vicinity of where Bouaké was, initially the village was named Gbèkèkro, so named after the leader of the Baoulé, Gossan Kwa Gbeke and kro meaning town or settlement of. Bouaké was established as a French military post in 1899 and has been an administrative center since 1914. French and United Nations peacekeepers currently reside in the city as part of an enforced ceasefire between the rebel-held north and the government-held south. After the attempt to overthrow the president Laurent Gbagbo had failed, the rebel forces FN (forces nouvelles) led by Guillaume Soro made Bouaké their center of control. Subsequently, Bouaké University, opened in 1996, was closed down in September 2002. Financed by Unesco, the university reopened in April, 2005. On 4 November 2004, governmental forces used Sukhoi-25s to raid the city as an opening movement towards "territorial liberation", according to Captain Jean-Noël Abbey of the Côte d'Ivoire army. Korhogo, 225 kilometres (140 miles) north of Bouaké, was also targeted. In 2014, the population of the sub-prefecture of Bouaké-SP was 71,949. Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Bouaké's climate as tropical wet and dry (Aw). The city features a lengthy wet season spanning the months of March through October, and a shorter harmattan-influenced dry season that covers the remaining 4 months. Despite the lengthy wet season, Bouaké does not see the level of rainfall experienced in Abidjan. Bouaké on average sees roughly 1,100 millimetres (43 in) of precipitation annually. Tobacco products, building materials, and textiles are produced, and cotton sisal and rice are processed. Gold, mercury, and manganese are found nearby. The overall economy was shaken during the near decade long rebel rule that started in 2002. Many companies either shut down or relocated to Abidjan, Ivory Coast's coastal economic hub. These events resulted in the 60% reduction in formal employment. For example, the city's biggest textile mill, the Gonfreville Establishment, saw an employment decrease of 1200 workers, an 80% reduction. Economic recovery was slow until the early 2010s. After the State took back control of Bouake after the 2010-2011 election, the economy moved into a state of reconstruction. Roads were repaved after years of neglect, which allowed the transportation of goods to become an easier task. Cash crops such as cotton and cashews started to be transported in higher quantities to be processed in Bouake. Singapore-based Olam opened a cashew processing plant in Bouake in 2012, which accounts for nearly 2400 jobs. The agribusiness as a whole is beginning to turn to its original state before the rebel conflict. Additionally, banks have opened new branches and supermarkets have returned to normal operation. The government is stimulating this regrowth through policies, such as price floors, and projects to increase trade, including the construction of a highway to connect Bouake to the nation's capital, Yamoussoukro. The city has the Bouaké Airport located north-west of the city with a 3,300 metres (10,800 ft) runway. Located on the line of the railway which connects Abidjan to Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, the city has the Railway Station Bouaké operated by Sitarail. The roads that connect Bouaké are the A3 and the A8 going clockwise from the north the A3 connects Katiola and with Korhogo on the A12 eastwards with further destinations in Burkina Faso and Mali. Eastwards the A10 starts in Bouaké and connects to Ghana and to Bondoukou via the A1 northwards and Abengourou southwards. The A8 connects to Abengourou northwards on the A1 and Abidjan southwards.
