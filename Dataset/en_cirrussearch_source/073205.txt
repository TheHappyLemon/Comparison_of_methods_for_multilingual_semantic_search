Progress M-65 (Russian: Прогресс М-65), identified by NASA as Progress 30P, was a Progress spacecraft used to resupply the International Space Station. It was a Progress-M 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 365. Progress M-65 was launched by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Launch occurred at 19:50 UTC on 10 September 2008. The spacecraft docked with the aft port of the Zvezda module at 18:43 UTC on 17 September 2008. Docking had originally been scheduled for 21:01 GMT on 12 September 2008, but was delayed after Hurricane Ike forced NASA to close the Johnson Space Center, which houses the US mission control centre for the ISS. A backup facility at the Marshall Space Flight Center was used during the docking. Following undocking at 16:19 UTC on 15 November 2008, it conducted a Plazma-Progress experiment. It was deorbited on 8 December 2008, with the 142 second deorbit burn beginning at 08:02 UTC. The spacecraft burned up in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean, with any remaining debris landing in the ocean at around 08:49 UTC. Progress M-65 carried supplies to the International Space Station, including food, water and oxygen for the crew and equipment for conducting scientific research. It also carried a new Orlan-MK spacesuit to replace one of the older Orlan-M suits previously used for EVAs from the station.
