Jacobsen is a Danish, Norwegian and Dutch patronymic surname meaning "son of Jacob". The prefix derives from the biblical given name Yaakov ("supplanter" or "follower"). The cognate Jakobsen is less common. The English language patronymic surname Jacobson is a parallel form, of which the earliest records are found in Huntingdon in 1244. Scandinavian immigrants to English-speaking countries often changed the spelling to Jacobson in order to accommodate English orthographic rules.
