Formed at Corinthians, after a loan at São Caetano he was sold to Coritiba in 2011, winning the Campeonato Paranaense in both of his seasons. He also won Série A twice at Cruzeiro, being voted the best player of each season. He joined Al-Ahli Dubai for €15 million in 2014, winning several items of silverware in the United Arab Emirates before returning to Brazil with Flamengo in 2017. A full international since 2014, Ribeiro represented Brazil at the Copa América in 2015, 2021 and 2022 FIFA World Cup. Born in Arujá but raised in Santa Isabel, both in the state of São Paulo, Ribeiro joined Corinthians' youth setup in 2001, aged ten, as a left-back. Promoted to the main squad in 2007 by manager Paulo César Carpegiani, he only appeared in four matches during that year, being relegated with the side. On 21 July 2008, after the arrival of Wellington Saci, Ribeiro was loaned to São Caetano, being successfully converted to an attacking midfielder during his two-year spell at the side. Ribeiro returned to Timão in January 2011, but was sold to Coritiba for a R$1.5 million fee on 21 February. He made eight appearances as the team won the year's Campeonato Paranaense, scoring in the third minute on 17 April to open a 4–1 win at Roma Esporte Apucarana. The following season, Ribeiro scored five times in 15 games as the team defended their title. On 6 May 2012, in the first leg of the final away to rivals Clube Atlético Paranaense, he opened a 2–2 draw. A week later, he struck the decisive effort as his team won in a penalty shootout at the Estadio Major Antonio do Couto Pereira. Ribeiro finished the 2012 campaign for Coxa as the club's topscorer in Série A along with teammate Deivid, with eight goals. On 26 August 2012, Ribeiro was sent off in a 3–1 loss at Figueirense for a foul on Fernandes. On 8 January 2013, Cruzeiro reached an agreement with Coritiba for Ribeiro, and he signed a four-year deal three days later. Ribeiro was a key attacking unit for Raposa during his two-year spell, along with Ricardo Goulart. He was also elected Série A's best player of the year twice in a row, as his side was crowned champions twice. After being linked to Manchester United, Milan, Monaco and Real Madrid during the 2015 winter transfer window, Ribeiro moved to Al-Ahli Dubai on 2 February 2015 for a reported €15 million transfer fee. Two days later, he made his debut in the seasons's UAE Arabian Gulf League, opening a 2–0 home win over Al-Sharjah from Luis Jiménez's assist, a minute after replacing Habib Fardan.

On 19 August 2015, in the first game of the new national season, Ribeiro scored twice – including a penalty kick – in an 8–1 home win over Al-Fujairah, and assisted compatriot Lima for two more. His team won the league, and Ribeiro told the media that the victory justified his surprise transfer to the team.
