This resulted in his sacking from the post in February 2008. From 2001 to 2002, he coached Tunisia. He was fired when Tunisia exited the 2002 African Cup of Nations in the first round after failing to score a single goal. He joined the Ivorian national team after the departure of Robert Nouzaret around 2004.

On 10 December 2010, Michel was hired head coach of the Equatorial Guinea to lead the team for 2012 Africa Cup of Nations they will co-host with Gabon. He suddenly resigned from his post on 19 October 2011, with the Africa Cup of Nations three months away, because he said he could not have the best players in the country, but five days later he was rehired thanks to the dismissal of Sports Minister Ruslan Obiang Nsue. On 21 December 2011, he resigned as coach of Equatorial Guinea again, citing interference from a "third party" as the reason for his departure.

Barely four months later, he resigned, stating that he "could not find an amicable agreement within the deadlines regarding my compliance with several provisions of the contract". The FKF has also stated that they were disappointed with his attitude especially in looking down towards local tournaments, even describing the 2012 CECAFA Cup as useless and sent Nandwa to handle the team as interim coach.
