The Mil Mi-17 (NATO reporting name: Hip) is a Soviet-designed Russian military helicopter family introduced in 1975 (Mi-8M), continuing in production as of 2021[update] at two factories, in Kazan and Ulan-Ude. It is known as the Mi-8M series in Russian service. The helicopter is mostly used as a medium twin-turbine transport helicopter, as well as an armed gunship version. Developed from the basic Mi-8 airframe, the Mi-17 was fitted with the larger Klimov TV3-117MT engines, rotors, and transmission developed for the Mi-14, along with fuselage improvements for heavier loads. Optional engines for "hot and high" conditions are the 1545 kW (2070 shp) Isotov TV3-117VM. Recent exports to China and Venezuela for use in high mountains have the new Klimov VK-2500 version of the Klimov TV3-117 engine with FADEC control.[citation needed] The designation Mi-17 is for export; the Russian armed forces call it the Mi-8MT. The Mi-17 is recognisable by the tail rotor on the port side instead of the starboard side, and dust shields in front of the engine intakes. Engine cowls are shorter than on the TV2-powered Mi-8, not extending as far over the cockpit, and an opening for a bleed air valve outlet is present forward of the exhaust.[citation needed] Actual model numbers vary by builder, engine type, and other options. As an example, the sixteen new Ulan Ude-built machines delivered to the Czech Air Force in 2005 with -VM model engines were designated as Mi-171Sh, a development of the Mi-8AMTSh. Modifications include a new large door on the right side, improved Czech-built APU, and Kevlar armour plates around the cockpit area and engines. Eight have a loading ramp in place of the usual clamshell doors and can load a vehicle up to the size of an SUV.[citation needed] In March 2007, licensed production of the Mi-17 started in China, with production being led by Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant JSC and the Sichuan Lantian Helicopter Company Limited in Chengdu, Sichuan province as a joint venture. The plant built 20 helicopters in 2008, using Russian Ulan-Ude-supplied kits; annual production was expected to increase to 80 helicopters. The variants planned to be built by Lantian include the Mi-171, Mi-17V-5, and Mi-17V-7. In 2021 it was reported that China was replacing the Russian-made Mi-17 with their own Z-20, except possibly for the Mi-171Sh assault helicopter; the last Mi-17 order was in 2014. In 2021 the website of Russian Helicopters, the manufacturer, said that the Mi-8/17 was "the most widely operated helicopter in history." Royal Cambodian Air Force Mi-17s were used during the Cambodian government's offensives; by 1994 ten operational airframes five were converted to helicopter gunships equipped with 57 mm rocket pods and providing air support for ground forces attacking the Khmer Rouge positions. In 1996 the Government launched an offensive during the dry season at the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Anlong Veng and Pailin, using five Mi-17 gunships and eight Mi-17-Mi-8 troops transports. In May 1999, during Operation Safed Sagar, the Mi-17 was used in the first air phase of the Kargil War by 129HU of the Indian Air Force (IAF) against the Pakistan Army. One IAF Mi-17 and one IAF MiG-21 were shot down by Pakistan Army Air Defence Anza-II shoulder-fired missiles. This led to the withdrawal of armed helicopters and attacks by fixed-wing aircraft in the Kargil theatre. The Mi-17 was used extensively by the Sri Lanka Air Force in Sri Lanka's war on terrorism by the LTTE. Seven of them were lost in combat and attacks on airports. Freelance pilot Neall Ellis operated an Mi-17 in support of the Sierra Leone government in the Sierra Leone Civil War, ferrying ammunition and other supplies to government troops. US Army Special Forces in Afghanistan extensively used CIA-operated Mi-17s during the initial stages of Operation Enduring Freedom. The Mi-17 is used for passenger transport by Air Koryo, national airline of North Korea. Previous flights include those between Pyongyang and Kaesong and Pyongyang and Haeju. The Mexican Navy uses its Mi-17s for anti-narcotic operations such as locating marijuana fields and dispatching marines to eradicate the plantations. The Slovak Air Force and Croatian Air Force operated Mi-17s in Kosovo as part of KFOR. Both the pro-Gaddafi and anti-Gaddafi forces in the 2011 Libyan civil war have operated Mi-17s. Mi-17s are operated by the Afghan Air Force. In July 2010 two Mi-17 were flown by a mixed crew of United States Air Force and Afghan Air Force personnel in a 13-hour mission that rescued 2,080 civilians from flood waters. This was the largest rescue by two helicopters in USAF history. USAF pilot Lt Col Gregory Roberts received the Distinguished Flying Cross for the mission. During the Tham Luang cave rescue in July 2018, the Royal Thai Army used the Mi-17 helicopter for searching operations, and evacuating the first batch of survivors from Tham Luang to Chiang Rai hospital; on 10 July 2018 a Mil Mi-17 helicopter took the last evacuated boy to the hospital. During the 19 November 2023 Houthi hijacking of the Galaxy Leader, one Mi-17 helicopter was used to land the hijacking team on the deck of the Galaxy Leader. In October 2007, the Saudi Arabian Government cancelled the purchase of 64 NHIndustries NH90 helicopters and agreed to buy 150 Russian-made Mil Mi-17 and Mi-35 helicopters instead. On 28 October 2008, the Royal Thai Army announced a deal to buy six Mi-17s to meet its requirement for a medium-lift helicopter. This is the first time the Thai armed forces have acquired Russian aircraft instead of American aircraft. Flight International quotes the Thai Army's rationale: "We are buying three Mi-17 helicopters for the price of one Black Hawk. The Mi-17 can also carry more than 30 troops, while the Black Hawk could carry only 13 soldiers. These were the key factors behind the decision." On 15 December 2008, it was reported that India ordered 80 Mi-17V-5 helicopters worth $1.375 billion, which would be delivered to the Indian Air Force between 2011 and 2014 to replace aging Mi-8s. In August 2010, it was reported that India planned to order another 59 Mi-17s. The first Mi-17V-5s entered service with India in February 2012. In December 2012, India signed a contract for 71 aircraft at a reported cost of US$1.3 billion. In December 2014 it was reported that India is in agreement with the Russian Federation to produce on its territory Mi-17s and Ka-226Ts. All 151 helicopters were delivered as of February 2016. On 11 June 2009, it was announced that the United States had handed over four Mi-17 cargo helicopters to the Pakistan Army to facilitate its counter-terrorism operations. This followed an urgent request for helicopters by Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani in a leaked US embassy cable. On 16 September 2009, the United States Navy delivered the last two of four Mi-17s to the Afghan National Army Air Corps. On 19 June 2010, it was announced that the US government would buy and refurbish 31 more Mi-17 helicopters from Russia to supply the Afghan Air Force. The US was reportedly considering adding the helicopter to the US military for special forces use in order to obscure troop movements. The US has used some Mi-8s and Mi-17s for training, and has purchased units for allies in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In August 2010 a contract was signed by the Argentine Air Force for two Mi-17Es, plus an option on another three, to support Antarctic bases. In September 2010, the Polish Defense Minister announced that his country would buy five new Mi-17s from Russia, to support Polish operations in Afghanistan. All five Mi-17-1Vs were delivered by 2011. In 2011, Chief of Staff of the Afghan National Army Abdul Wahab Wardak announced that the US government would buy Mi-17s for use by Afghanistan's troops. He explained the choice of the Russian helicopter over the American Chinook was due to the familiarity of the Afghan technical and pilot staff with the helicopter type and that it is better suited for Afghanistan's environment.[citation needed] The United States continued to purchase the helicopters for Afghanistan in 2013, despite a congressional prohibition. Overall, 63 Mi-17s were acquired through the 2011 contract at a cost of US$16.4 to US$18.4 million each, or US$4 to US$6 million more each than a refurbished American Chinook. China signed two contracts with Rosoboronexport in 2009 and 2012 for 32 and 52 Mi-171E, respectively. In 2014 and 2015, Bangladesh ordered a total of 11 Mi-171Sh helicopters. 5 more ordered in 2017.

A contract with the civilian airline QINGDAO for the supply of six Mi-171 helicopters with VK-2500-03 engines was signed in December 2019. In 2019, the Philippine Air Force reportedly expressed its interest in acquiring 16 Mi-171 helicopters for its heavy-lift helicopter requirement, with a possible option to add one Mi-171 that is fitted for VVIP transport, in a deal worth P12.5 billion to be signed during the official visit to Russia by President Rodrigo Duterte. From 3 to 7 March 2020, a delegation composed of Philippine military and defense officials, and officials of the Embassy of the Philippines in Russia met with representatives from Sovtechnoexport and visited the Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant. Local defense blog Maxdefense Philippines reported that a Notice of Award (NOA) was issued during the third quarter of 2020, although it was unclear if it was awarded to Sovtechnoexport or Rosoboronexport. On 27 July 2022, the Philippine government canceled the deal to purchase 16 Mi-17 helicopters due to fears of possible U.S. sanctions. In 2021 Russia offered the Argentine Air Force Mil Mi-17 helicopters as part of a bigger arms deals. Russia in October 2021 delivered to Mali 2 Mi-171Sh and 2 Mi-17V-5 helicopters in the framework of a contract signed in December 2020. Bangladesh and Peru each ordered 2 Mi-171A2s in 2021. On 13 April 2022, US President Joe Biden announced that the US Government would supply 11 Mi-17 helicopters to the Ukrainian government to aid in its defense during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. supplied 16 Mi-17s including five that were undergoing maintenance in Ukraine when Russia invaded. These helicopters belonged to the former Afghan government, but were paid for by the US under the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. Therefore the Pentagon treated these aircraft as its property after that government fell in September 2021.
