Foundation Ice Stream (83°15′S 60°00′W﻿ / ﻿83.250°S 60.000°W﻿ / -83.250; -60.000﻿ (Foundation Ice Stream)) is a major ice stream in the Pensacola Mountains of Antarctica. The ice stream drains northward for 150 nautical miles (280 km; 170 mi) along the west side of the Patuxent Range and the Neptune Range to enter the Ronne Ice Shelf westward of Dufek Massif. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) mapped the stream from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1956–66. The United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) named the stream in recognition of the National Science Foundation, which provided major support to the U.S. Antarctic Research Program during this period. Head of the ice stream west of mid-section east of mid-section Mouth of the ice stream The Foundation Ice Stream originates to the west of the Patuxent Range. It flows northwest past the Rambo Nunataks to the north and Thomas Hills to the south, where it is joined from the right (south) by the MacNamara Glacier. Further down the Academy Glacier joins it from the right. The ice stream continues north-northwest past the Williams Hills of the Neptune Range. It is joined from the east by the Childs Glacier before passing Schmidt Hills to its east. The mouth of the ice stream meets the Ronne Ice Shelf.
