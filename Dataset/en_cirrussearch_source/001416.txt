The national emblem of Mozambique was adopted in 1990 in the Constitution of Mozambique article 194. The article clearly states the design and meaning of the device. It shows a gear wheel, bordered by corn stalks and sugarcane. In the middle there is a red sun over a map of Mozambique in green, and blue waves, an AK-47 crossed with a hoe, and a book. The wreath is tied with a ribbon bearing the name of the country. The emblem is rendered in a socialist heraldry style similar to those used by the republics of the Soviet Union. As described in article 194 of the Mozambican constitution, the various parts of the emblem each have a special symbolism, including: the corn stalk and the sugar cane represent agricultural wealth the cog wheel represents labor and industry the book represents education the hoe for "peasantry and agriculture production" the AK-47, with a bayonet attached, for "defense and vigilance" the red star represents the spirit of international solidarity of the Mozambican people". the red sun symbolizes the building of a new life From 1975-1982, the map of Mozambique was brown instead of green. Along with this change of colour, the position of the wreath was changed, the text was changed from black to gold, and a gold border was added around the red star. In 1990, with the implementation of the new constitution, the name of the country was changed from República Popular de Moçambique to República de Moçambique, and the text on the emblem was changed accordingly. Mozambique's parliamentary opposition would specifically like to see removed the image of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, which symbolizes the nation's struggle for independence, according to press reports.
