Mathias Jensen (born 1 January 1996) is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Premier League club Brentford and the Denmark national team. Jensen is a product of the Nordsj√¶lland academy and began his senior career with the club in 2016. Following two seasons as a regular member of the team, he transferred to Celta Vigo in 2018. After an injury-hit 2018‚Äì19 season, he transferred to Brentford and was a part of the squad which was promoted to the Premier League in 2021. A former Denmark youth international, Jensen made his full international debut in 2020. A midfielder, Jensen progressed through the academy at Nordsj√¶lland and signed a three-year professional contract in January 2015. He was promoted into the first team squad for the 2015‚Äì16 season and made five appearances during the campaign, scoring one goal, which came in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Randers on 1 May 2016. Jensen was a regular in the 2016‚Äì17 season, making 22 appearances, before 2017‚Äì18 proved to be his breakthrough season. He made 36 appearances, scored 12 goals, was awarded the captaincy and his achievements were recognised by the DBU and his club, with the DBU 2017 Talent of the Year and FC Nordsj√¶lland Player of the Year awards respectively. After three early 2018‚Äì19-season appearances, Jensen departed Nordsj√¶lland in August 2018. During just over three seasons as a professional at Farum Park, Jensen made 66 appearances and scored 15 goals. On 8 August 2018, Jensen moved to Spain joining La Liga club Celta Vigo on a five-year contract. During an injury-affected 2018‚Äì19 season, he made just six appearances and left the club in July 2019. On 10 July 2019, Jensen moved to England signing with Championship club Brentford on a four-year contract, with the option of an additional year, for an undisclosed fee, reported to be ¬£3.5 million. He made 43 appearances and scored one goal during the 2019‚Äì20 season, which ended with defeat in the 2020 Championship play-off final. Jensen made a career high 53 appearances during the 2020‚Äì21 season and celebrated promotion to the Premier League with victory in the 2021 Championship play-off final. As a result of suffering a "badly gashed" foot while away on international duty, Jensen missed Brentford's entire 2021‚Äì22 pre-season and the first three matches of the regular season. Restricted to a mix of starting and substitute roles, particularly after the January 2022 signing of Christian Eriksen, Jensen made 35 appearances during a "stop-start" season. Despite being affected by COVID-19 and another minor injury, Jensen won praise from head coach Thomas Frank for training "like an animal" while sidelined. Entering the final year of his contract, Jensen hired his own personal trainer to work with him daily during the off-season in Denmark and he returned for the 2022‚Äì23 pre-season "in incredible shape". He was challenged by head coach Thomas Frank to be the replacement for the departed Christian Eriksen. Jensen began the regular season in a starting role and as a regular set piece taker. Coaching from specialist throw-in coach Thomas Gronnemark helped length his throws. Jensen's performance and first Premier League goal in a 4‚Äì0 win over Manchester United on 13 August 2022 was recognised with the man of the match award. On 18 January 2022, Jensen signed a new 3+1‚ÅÑ2-year contract, with the option of a further year. Head coach Thomas Frank commended Jensen's "pressing abilities", "his defensive mindset" and stated that "he has been one of our best players so far this season". In the process of winning his 23rd cap for Denmark in a Euro 2024 qualifier versus Finland on 23 March 2023, Jensen became Brentford's most-capped international player. Until missing the final match of the season, Jensen was an ever-present starter in league matches and he improved his goal tally to five. An ever-present starter in league matches until being sidelined for a month with an adductor issue in late November 2023, Jensen was then Brentford's second-highest scorer so far during the 2023‚Äì24 season, with four goals. Jensen made 30 appearances and scored 3 goals for Denmark between U18 and U21 level. He was a part of Denmark's squads at the 2017 and 2019 European U21 Championships. Jensen was named in the senior team's preliminary 35-man squad for the 2018 World Cup, but he was not included in the final squad. In October 2020, Jensen won a late call-up to the full Denmark squad for a series of three matches, as a replacement for injured Brentford teammate Christian N√∏rgaard. He made his full international debut with a start in a 4‚Äì0 friendly win over the Faroe Islands on 7 October and scored his first full international goal on his fifth cap, in a 8‚Äì0 2022 World Cup qualifying win over Moldova on 28 March 2021. Jensen was named in the Denmark squad for Euro 2020 and he appeared as a substitute in each of the six matches during the Danes' run to the semi-final. Jensen was named in Denmark's 2022 World Cup squad and made two appearances prior to the team's group stage exit. Jensen has been described as a "player who can dictate the game", "has a great passing ability" and "a great football brain". Midway through the 2022‚Äì23 season, he remarked that while he has "always been a technical player who doesn't really enjoy the big tackles", he had developed his "aggression" and "adapted to the tempo of the Premier League". Jensen is a Manchester United and Barcelona supporter.
