Moon Bay is a bay 7 nautical miles (13 km) wide which recedes 4 nautical miles (7 km) between Edinburgh Hill and Renier Point, on the east side of Livingston Island, in the South Shetland Islands off Antarctica. The glaciers Sopot Ice Piedmont, Iskar, Huron, Struma, Kaliakra, Panega and Debelt feed the bay. Both Half Moon Island and Elemag Reef lie in Moon Bay. The bay was known to sealers in the area as early as 1821. It was recharted in 1935 by Discovery Investigations personnel on the Discovery II, and probably named by them for nearby Half Moon Island, which lies in the entrance to the bay.
