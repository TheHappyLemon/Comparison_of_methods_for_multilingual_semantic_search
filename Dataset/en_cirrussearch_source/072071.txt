The Mosul Vilayet (Arabic: ولاية الموصل; Ottoman Turkish: ولايت موصل, romanized: Vilâyet-i Musul) was a first-level administrative division (vilayet) of the Ottoman Empire. It was created from the northern sanjaks of the Baghdad Vilayet in 1878. At the beginning of the 20th century it reportedly had an area of 29,220 square miles (75,700 km2), while the preliminary results of the first Ottoman census of 1885 (published in 1908) gave the population as 300,280. The accuracy of the population figures ranges from "approximate" to "merely conjectural" depending on the region from which they were gathered. The city of Mosul and the area south to the Little Zab was allocated to France in the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement of the First World War, and later transferred to Mandatory Iraq following Mosul Question. Sanjaks of the vilayet: Mosul Sanjak (Mosul) Kerkük Sanjak (Kirkuk) Sulaymaniyah Sanjak (Sulaymaniyah) According to early 20th-century British intelligence, the vilayet had a Kurdish majority and a Turkoman minority.
