The Au Cordon Doré at 33 metres event was part of the archery programme at the 1900 Summer Olympics. Qualification for the event was through the large open team events, with the top eight individual archers competing in the individual competition. The identities of the top three archers are the only ones known. No scores are recorded for any of the archers. This was the only appearance of the men's Au Cordon Doré at 33 metres. A 50 metres version was also held in 1900. Little is known about the format of the competition. "Archery at the 1900 Paris Summer Games: Men's Au Cordon Doré 33 metres". Sports Reference.
