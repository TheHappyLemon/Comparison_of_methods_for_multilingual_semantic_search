An independence referendum was held in the Latvian SSR on 3 March 1991, alongside a similar referendum in the Estonian SSR the same day. Known as the "Popular Survey about the independence of the Republic of Latvia", voters were asked "are you in favour of a democratic and independent Republic of Latvia". It was approved by 74.9% of voters, with a turnout of 87.6%. Latvian Republic civilians registered in Soviet Army units also had the right to vote in this poll. The independence of Latvia was finally restored on 21 August 1991. 1991 Estonian independence referendum 1991 Lithuanian independence referendum 1991 Soviet Union referendum Dieter Nohlen & Philip Stöver (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1122 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7 Nohlen & Stöver, p1136 LATVIJAS REPUBLIKAS AUGSTĀKĀS PADOMES LĒMUMS Par kārtību, kādā notiek Latvijas iedzīvotāju aptauja "Iedzīvotāju aptauja par Latvijas Republikas neatkarību" [Population survey on the independence of the Republic of Latvia] (Press release) (in Latvian).
