Julian Eligiusz Aleksandrovich Michaux (Russian: Юлиан Александрович Александрович Мишо, 1 December 1867 – 11 December 1925), born in Warsaw, Congress Poland, was a polish fencer. He competed in the individual masters sabre event at the 1900 Summer Olympics where he finished 5th. His great-grandfather in the beginning of the 19th century came from Liège, now part of Belgium, to Warsaw - thus the french family name. Rocznik Oficerski 1924, p. 1415 "Julian Michaux". Olympedia.
