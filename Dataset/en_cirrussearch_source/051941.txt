Susan Dunklee (born February 13, 1986, in Newport, Vermont) is a retired American biathlete. Dunklee was raised in the town of Barton, Vermont and started skiing at the age of two, first entering cross-country competitions at the age of seven. She attended St. Johnsbury Academy, in St. Johnsbury, Vermont for high school. She took up biathlon while she was a senior at Dartmouth College, where she studied ecology. While at Dartmouth, Dunklee was also a member of Dartmouth's 2007 National Championship Ski team and was active in the Dartmouth Outing Club. Prior to this she had been a double All-American in cross-country skiing. Her best World Cup finish was 2nd in a Sprint event in Presque Isle, ME in 2016. At the 2012 Biathlon World Championships in Ruhpolding, Dunklee set a new World Championship best with a fifth place in the individual event.

Susan's father, Stan Dunklee, was a former NCAA cross-country skiing champion and competed at the 1976 and 1980 Winter Olympics, while her uncle Everett Dunklee competed in cross-country skiing at the 1972 Winter Olympics. On February 19, 2017, Dunklee finished 2nd in the Mass Start at Hochfilzen in the 2017 Biathlon World Championships, winning her first World Championship medal.
