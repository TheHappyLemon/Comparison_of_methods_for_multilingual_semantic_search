"What Do You Want from Me?" is a 2007 song recorded by Cascada. It was released in Germany on 7 March 2008 and was released on 24 March 2008 for the UK. "What Do You Want From Me?" was leaked online in advance of the Perfect Day album release, and was speculated to be title "Tell Me Why". In late 2007, All Around the World announced "What Do You Want From Me?" would be the U.K. follow-up to "What Hurts the Most". This track and "Everytime We Touch" share a similar chord structure. Cascada's UK music label, All Around the World, released the music video on 19 January 2008, on their official site. In the video, Natalie and 3 friends are seen at a beach-side house, on the beach, and at a late night party, singing and dancing. In all scenes, she is continuously being followed or somehow connected by a young man, hence the song title "What Do You Want From Me?". German release "What Do You Want From Me?"
