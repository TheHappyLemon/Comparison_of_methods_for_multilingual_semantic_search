Suriname is divided into 10 districts (Dutch: districten). The country was first divided up into subdivisions by the Dutch on October 8, 1834, when a Royal Decree declared that there were to be 8 divisions and 2 districts: Upper Suriname and Torarica Para Upper Commewijne Upper Cottica and Perica Lower Commewijne Lower Cottica Matapica Saramacca Coronie (district) Nickerie (district) The divisions were areas near the capital city, Paramaribo, and the districts were areas further away from the city. In 1927, Suriname's districts were revised, and the country was divided into 7 districts. In 1943, 1948, 1949, 1952 and 1959 further small modifications were made. On October 28, 1966, the districts were redrawn again, into Nickerie Coronie Saramacca Brokopondo Para Suriname Paramaribo Commewijne Marowijne These divisions remained until 1980, when yet again, the borders of the districts were redrawn, however, with the following requirements: Changes in the old boundaries were made only if it leads to improved functioning Each area should be developed The new boundaries should respect the identities of indigenous people.
