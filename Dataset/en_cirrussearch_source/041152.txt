He has two brothers who are also professional footballers – Paweł and Tomasz Zieliński. Zieliński started his career at his local club, Orzeł Ząbkowice Śląskie, where he was coached by his father. At the age of 14, he joined Zagłębie Lubin, even though he was wanted by Bayer Leverkusen and Liverpool and also had trials at Feyenoord and Heerenveen. He rose through the ranks and started training with the first team at the age of 15, under Franciszek Smuda. At 17, he moved abroad to join Udinese after they scouted him on international youth tournament. Zieliński made his debut in Serie A on 2 November 2012 when he replaced Antonio Di Natale in 91st minute of a match against Cagliari. In 2014, Zieliński joined Empoli on loan. On 4 August 2016, after months of transfer speculation, Zieliński moved from Udinese to Napoli for a reported €16 million. He scored his first goal with Partenopei's shirt on 3 December, in a 3–0 home win against Inter Milan; he ended his first season with six goals. On 31 August 2020, he signed new contract with Napoli until June 2023. On 31 October 2021, not only did he decide the derby between Salernitana and Napoli, scoring the only goal of the game, but with 32 goals he also became the second best Polish goal-scorer in Serie A's history (behind Arkadiusz Milik), beating Zbigniew Boniek's record. On 17 February 2022, he scored a goal for Napoli in a Europa League match against Barcelona which ended in a 1–1 draw. On 7 September 2022, he scored two goals and had one assist in a Champions League match against Liverpool, which concluded in a 4–1 victory for Napoli. On 4 June 2013, Zieliński made his senior international debut for the Poland national team in a friendly match against Liechtenstein. In May 2018, he was named in Poland's preliminary 35-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. His older brothers Tomasz and Paweł are also footballers. On 15 June 2019, Zieliński married Laura Słowiak with whom he has a son, Maksymilian (born 2021).
