On 19 May 2007, Stuttgart defeated Energie Cottbus 2–1, winning the Bundesliga, with Osorio making one of the highest number of appearances for the season. On 2 May 2010, Stuttgart president Erwin Staudt announced that Osorio would be leaving the club on a Bosman transfer. On 5 July 2010, he returned to Mexico after four years in Germany, signing for Monterrey. In his debut season, Monterrey won the Apertura 2010 championship, beating Santos Laguna in the final.

On 21 June 2007, Osorio played for Mexico against Guadeloupe in the CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament. After the match, he announced that he would not participate in the Copa América tournament, due to overloaded work schedules with his club, who would also play in the 2007–08 Champions League. He stated that he and teammate Pável Pardo had not taken any holiday break since the World Cup in Germany. Stuttgart coach Armin Veh was satisfied to hear this news and sent his thanks to national team coach Hugo Sánchez for letting the players rest and take a vacation.
