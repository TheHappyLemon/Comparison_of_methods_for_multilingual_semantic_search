Brändle is a seven-time winner of the Austrian National Time Trial Championships (2009, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2019, 2020 and 2021), and also won the Austrian National Road Race Championships in 2016.

The record stood until 8 February 2015 when it was broken by Australian rider Rohan Dennis. He was named in the start list for the 2015 Tour de France.
