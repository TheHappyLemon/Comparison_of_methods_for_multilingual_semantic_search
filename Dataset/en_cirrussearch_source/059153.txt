The 2000–01 UEFA Champions League was the 46th season of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA's premier European club football tournament, and the ninth since it was rebranded from the "European Champion Clubs' Cup" or "European Cup". The competition was won by Bayern Munich for their first title since 1976, defeating Valencia 5–4 on penalties after a 1–1 draw after extra time. It was the German club's first UEFA Champions League title and their fourth European Cup overall; Valencia suffered their second consecutive final defeat, having lost to Real Madrid in the previous season. The knockout phase saw Bayern eliminate the preceding two Champions League winners, Manchester United and Real Madrid, winning all four games in the process. Valencia, meanwhile, defeated English sides Arsenal and Leeds United in the knockout phase en route to the final. The 2001 final saw the two previous seasons' runners-up clash, Bayern Munich lost to Manchester United in the 1999 final and Valencia lost to Real Madrid in the 2000 final. Real Madrid were the defending champions, but they were eliminated by eventual winners Bayern Munich in the semi-finals.
