Venice Marco Polo Airport (IATA: VCE, ICAO: LIPZ) is the international airport of Venice, Italy. It is located on the mainland near the village of Tessera, a frazione of the comune of Venice located about 4.1 nautical miles (7.6 kilometres; 4.7 miles) east of Mestre (on the mainland) and around the same distance north of Venice proper. Due to the importance of Venice as a leisure destination, it features flights to many European metropolitan areas as well as some partly seasonal long-haul routes to the United States, Canada, South Korea and the Middle East. The airport handled 11,184,608 passengers in 2018, making it the fourth-busiest airport in Italy. The airport is named after Marco Polo and serves as a base for Volotea, Ryanair, Wizz Air and easyJet. Another airport located in the Venice area, Treviso Airport, is sometimes unofficially labelled Venice – Treviso and serves low-cost airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air. A modern terminal was opened in 2002, but it is already at full capacity.[when?][citation needed] The airport is managed by SAVE S.p.A., a company partially owned by local authorities that also controls the smaller Treviso Airport, dedicated to low-cost carriers. The airport was named after the Venetian traveller Marco Polo. The airport terminal has three floors: the ground floor for arrivals and the second floor for departures. The departure area has 70 check-in desks and has two airside lounges. The "Tintoretto Lounge" is for SkyTeam passengers and the "Marco Polo Room" is for all other passengers.
