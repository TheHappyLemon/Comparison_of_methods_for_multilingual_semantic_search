At the time, the brand's flagship smartphone was the Samsung Omnia and its successor, powered by Windows Mobile. Omnia had been the second full-touch Samsung device running the TouchWiz user interface (after the Tocco), but the Galaxy had an unmodified Google Android interface; the TouchWiz UI made its way to the Galaxy series with the Samsung Galaxy S. The Galaxy S and its successor Galaxy S II became very successful, eclipsing the company's other lines and operating systems. During the decade, the Samsung Galaxy phones "became the company's most-praised products [and] also were among the best-selling smartphones in the world." The Galaxy Z series is a line of high-end foldable smartphones. The line started in 2019 with the Galaxy Z Fold. The latest phones from this series are the Galaxy Z Flip5 and the Galaxy Z Fold5, both released in July 2023. The Galaxy S series is a line of high-end smartphones.

The Galaxy M series is a line of online-exclusive, mid-range smartphones; considered the successor to the Galaxy J and Galaxy On series. The Galaxy F series is a line of low-end phones. The Galaxy XCover series is a line of rugged "business" phones, which have low-end specifications but with stronger build quality and durability. The latest in common is the Galaxy Xcover 7. Samsung released multiple series of smartphones, often overlapping with each other. Most of these series were dropped. The Galaxy Note series was a line of high-end devices primarily oriented towards pen computing. The line was replaced by the Galaxy S Ultra series after 2022. The Galaxy Core/Grand series is a line of mid-range devices released between 2013 and 2015. The line was replaced by the J series. The Galaxy J series was a line of entry-range phones, replaced by the Galaxy A series in 2019. The Galaxy Mega series was last updated in 2014 with the Samsung Galaxy Mega 2.

Samsung announced the Samsung Galaxy Gear, a smartwatch running Android 4.3, on 4 September 2013. The Galaxy Gear was Samsung's only smartwatch to feature Galaxy branding; later Samsung smartwatches use the Samsung Gear branding. The Gear series was later succeeded by the Samsung Galaxy Watch series. In a software update in May 2014, Samsung replaced the operating system of the Galaxy Gear from Android to Tizen.[citation needed] Samsung's One UI, which is running on newer Samsung Galaxy devices released after 2019, is available to Samsung Galaxy Watch on 20 May 2019. Samsung announced the Samsung Galaxy Fit, an activity tracker positioned below the Galaxy Watch line. The first iteration was released on 2019. Samsung later announced the Galaxy Fit2, which is a follow-up of their first tracker from 2019. Samsung announced the Samsung Galaxy Buds, which is the new replacement to the Samsung Gear IconX.[better source needed]. The first iteration was released on 20 February 2019. Subsequent Galaxy Buds iterations will be revealed during the Galaxy Unpacked event annually. The Galaxy brand is also extended in laptops, notebooks, and 2-in-1 convertibles. The Samsung Galaxy Book consists of products based on Microsoft Windows, while the Galaxy Chromebook line is based on ChromeOS. Samsung Galaxy Player Samsung Galaxy Camera Samsung Galaxy Camera 2 Samsung Galaxy NX Samsung Galaxy Beam i8520 Samsung Galaxy Beam i8530 Samsung Galaxy smartphones run the Android operating system under the Google Mobile Services platform, however Samsung and third-parties have bundled various other software in them too. The TouchWiz interface was used until 2017, replaced by Samsung Experience. This was then replaced by One UI in 2019. The company has created many apps and services under the Galaxy brand specifically for these devices - many of which come preloaded - including the Galaxy Store which provides apps and customizations. Since late 2019, several Microsoft apps like Outlook also come preloaded on Galaxy as a result of a Samsung-Microsoft partnership. Samsung have made several tools for making various Galaxy devices like phones, tablets and watches, work closer together. Samsung Flow is a feature allowing content to be synced with a PC, such as notifications, replying to messages and authenticating from a PC, and sharing content. It was announced in November 2014, released in a preview form in May 2015 and final released in May 2016. Microsoft's Phone Link also comes on Galaxy smartphones since 2019. Another feature named Multi Control allows controlling of a Galaxy smartphone with a Galaxy Book keyboard and mouse, and drag and drop files between them. Device Control is another feature in the quick panel that can control SmartThings and other devices. The following is a table showing the full initial release history of every Galaxy device since 2009. Starting from the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Samsung phones and tablets contained a warning label stating that it would only operate with SIM cards from the region the phone was sold in. A spokesperson clarified the policy, stating that it was intended to prevent grey-market reselling, and that it only applied to the first SIM card inserted. For devices to use a SIM card from other regions, one of the following actions totaling five minutes or longer in length must first be performed with the SIM card from the local region: Make calls on the phone or watch from the Samsung Phone app Use the Call and Text on Other Devices feature to make calls With the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 series in 2017, that process has changed. Due to the fact that many variants use a Multi-CSC, it will only work with SIM cards from the same CSC group. For example, an AT&T SIM card will not work on cellular-based Galaxy devices sold in Europe and other countries. "Over the Horizon" is the trademark sound for Samsung smartphone devices, first introduced in 2011 on the Galaxy S II. It was composed by Joong-sam Yun and appears as music in the music library of most Samsung phones released since 2011. Prior to 2011, "Beyond Samsung" served as Samsung's trademark music track, while "Samsung Tune" was used as the default ringtone. The sound appears as the default ringtone, as well as the sound when the phone turns on or off (a snippet is used), and as a notification sound. While the basic composition of the six-note tune has not changed since its inception, various versions of different genres have been introduced as the product line evolved. While the first two versions were created in-house at Samsung, later versions were outsourced to external musicians. The sound has been covered by various popular artists who have released their own arrangements and remixes of the song, such as Quincy Jones, Icona Pop, Suga of BTS, and various K-Pop artists. In Samsung's U.S. registration of the trademark for the sound, it is described as "the sound of a bell playing a B4 dotted eighth note, a B4 sixteenth note, an F#5 sixteenth note, a B5 sixteenth note, an A#5 eighth note, and an F#5 half note".
