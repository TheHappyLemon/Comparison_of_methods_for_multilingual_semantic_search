Amanita strobiliformis is a species of mushroom. It is commonly referred to as warted amanita. The cap is 7.5 to 25.5 centimetres (3 to 10 inches) across, is rough with warts which sometimes fall away leaving the cap smooth, whitish, and sometimes has some brown. The gills are free and rounded behind. The veil is large and sometimes adhere to the margin of the cap. The stipe (stem) is 7.5 to 20 cm (3 to 8 in) long, thick, white, bulbous, and sometimes weighs a pound. The spores are elliptical. A. strobiliformis In Europe, A. strobiliformis grows from the Mediterranean region to the Netherlands and England, and maybe further north. It is associated mycorhizal with deciduous trees, preferring scattered forest, or woodland borders, usually on alkaline soil. It grows singular fruits and sometimes clusters. The fungus is rare. The edibility is unknown,[citation needed] but the genus Amanita contains some of the most toxic fungi known. Some amanitas are deadly in only very small doses, while others are relatively harmless and sometimes even considered fit for human consumption.
