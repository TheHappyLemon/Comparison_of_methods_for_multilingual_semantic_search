Nuevo Estadio de Los Cármenes ([esˈtaðjo ˈnweβo los ˈkaɾmenes]) is a multi-use stadium in Granada, Spain. Currently, it is used mostly for football matches. The stadium holds 19,336 people, and was built in 1995 to be the home ground of Granada CF, the main football club of the city. The stadium opened on 16 May 1995. On 6 June 1995, Real Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen contested the first match at the new stadium. Real Madrid won the match with a final score of 1:0. Peter Dubovský scored the goal.

Granada CF played the first match on 22 August during the celebration of the XXIII Granada Trophy when they beat Real Betis by a score of 4–1. After the promotion of Granada CF to La Liga in 2019, the stadium was renovated: there were improvements of lighting and pitch quality, aesthetic change in the stand and a new fan shop opening.
