And, it's more, like, you know rage is, like, it's not that good, like, raging is, like, rebellious, like, and, like, with love, like, you know, love is good. Like, but love is also bad too. It's horrible. And it was, like, a lot of songs are a little darker and stuff and, like, you can hear the stuff that I say–stuff, like, yeah–I don't know, I'm always in a bad space, even if I'm, like–I don't know, I'm crazy.
