The Keila is a river in northern Estonia. One attraction along the river is Keila Falls (Estonian: Keila juga). Located on the grounds of the former Keila Manor and along the Keila River, Keila River Park (Estonian: Keila Jõepark) dates back to the 17th century. The ruins of a prehistoric sacrificial stone and a small castle can be seen while strolling around the park. Several bat species also inhabit the vicinity and can be seen soaring through the park on summer nights. Keila Falls "Keila River". memim.com. Retrieved 2021-12-17.
