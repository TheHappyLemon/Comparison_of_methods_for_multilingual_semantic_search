Fussballclub St. Gallen 1879, commonly known as St. Gallen, is a Swiss professional football club based in the city of St. Gallen, Canton of St. Gallen. As of the 2022–23 season, the team competes in the Swiss Super League. Founded on 19 April 1879, FC St. Gallen is the oldest club still in existence in Swiss football. However, the team has had relatively little success in comparison to other clubs. Despite the fact that St. Gallen won the Swiss championship twice in the 1903–04 and 1999–2000 seasons, the team has mostly been a mid-table side. During the end of the 2000s, the strength of the club continually declined. St. Gallen were relegated to the second-tier Challenge League twice at the end of the 2007–08 and the 2010–11 seasons. Since promotion back to the Swiss Super League, they have been in the top division for the last ten years with the club finishing as runners up in the 2019–20 season. In 2016, FC St. Gallen, became a member of the exclusive Club of Pioneers, as the oldest football club of Switzerland. FC St. Gallen play their home games at the Kybunpark. The stadium has a capacity of 19,694 and it is on the west side of town. The stadium replaced the former Espenmoos stadium in the east.
