Mesityl oxide is a α,β-unsaturated ketone with the formula CH3C(O)CH=C(CH3)2. This compound is a colorless, volatile liquid with a honey-like odor. It is prepared by the aldol condensation of acetone to give diacetone alcohol, which readily dehydrates to give this compound. Phorone and isophorone may be formed under the same conditions. Isophorone originates via a Michael addition: Phorone is formed by continued aldol condensation: Mesityl oxide is used as a solvent and in the production of methyl isobutyl ketone by hydrogenation: Further hydrogenation gives 4-methyl-2-pentanol (methyl isobutyl carbinol). Dimedone is another established use of mesityl oxide. NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards. "#0385". National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). "Mesityl oxide".
