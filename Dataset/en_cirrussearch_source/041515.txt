Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing series managed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body. The "formula" in the name alludes to a series of FIA rules to which all participants and vehicles are required to conform. The Formula One World Championship season consists of a series of races around the world, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. Each Grand Prix meeting lasts three days with either one or three practice sessions before a three-part qualifying session on either Friday or Saturday to set the starting order for Sunday's race. A Saturday sprint is held at select events, with the starting grid determined by a separate, shorter qualifying session. Grands Prix are frequently named after the country, region or city in which they are raced, and in some seasons, nations have hosted more than one event. Should Formula One hold two or more races in the same nation in the same year, on either a different or the same track, then their names will be different. The results of each Grand Prix held throughout the season are combined to decide two annual championships, one for drivers and one for constructors. Grand Prix distance regulations have varied throughout Formula One history. Between 1950 and 1957, events ran for more than 300 km (190 mi) or three hours. In 1958, race lengths were set between 300 and 500 km (190 and 310 mi) or two hours. It was reduced to between 300 and 400 km (190 and 250 mi) from 1966 with an established maximum length of 321.87 km (200.00 mi) in 1971. From 1973 to 1980, races had to last either 321.87 km (200.00 mi) or two hours, whichever came first. Distances of between 250 and 320 km (160 and 200 mi) or two hours were used from 1981 to 1984. The minimum distance was revised to 300 km (190 mi) including the formation lap in 1984 and the maximum length was standardised at 305 km (190 mi) in 1989. The exception to the rule is the Monaco Grand Prix, which has a scheduled length of at least 260 km (160 mi). No race can last more than two hours if it goes unhalted. From 2012, the maximum permitted race time including probable stoppages was four hours, before being reduced to three hours for 2021. The British Grand Prix and Italian Grand Prix are the most frequently held events in the Formula One World Championship with 74 editions each since the races first formed a part of the series in 1950, followed by the Monaco Grand Prix which has been held 69 times, all on the same course, the Circuit de Monaco. Italy's Monza Circuit has hosted the most Grands Prix on any circuit with 73. The Circuit de Monaco is second with 69 events and the Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom is third with 58 races. Austria, Bahrain, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States have all held two Grands Prix in various seasons; the United States (1982 and 2023) and Italy (2020) are the only countries to have hosted three races during a season. Italy has held the most Grands Prix with 105 since its first in 1950. Only Morocco has staged just one Grand Prix. The most recent addition was the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023. As of the 2024 Australian Grand Prix, 1,104 World Championship events have been held over 75 seasons in 34 countries and under 54 race titles at 77 racing circuits. These figures include the Indianapolis 500 races which were a part of the World Championships from 1950 until 1960 despite not being named a Grand Prix. The 1950 British Grand Prix was the first Formula One World Championship Grand Prix. Not included in this list are non-championship Grands Prix held to Formula One regulations from 1946 to 1983 and as part of each of the British Formula One Championship and the South African Formula One Championship. Races have been held under 54 race titles as of the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. There have been 34 countries that have hosted a Formula One World Championship race, as of the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix A total of 77 circuits have hosted a Formula One World Championship race, as of the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix The primary reason for the reduction of Grand Prix distance throughout the history of Formula One was to accommodate television preferring shorter races with more on-track activity. The 70th Anniversary Grand Prix was held in the United Kingdom. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was held in the United Arab Emirates. The 1999 Argentine Grand Prix was on the provisional 1999 schedule, but it was cancelled as a consequence of the failure to reach a financial agreement.
