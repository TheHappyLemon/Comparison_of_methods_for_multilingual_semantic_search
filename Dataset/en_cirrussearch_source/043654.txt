Oghenekaro Peter Etebo (born 9 November 1995) is a Nigerian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for the Nigeria national team. Etebo started out at Warri Wolves where he spent three years before moving into European football with Portuguese side Feirense. He helped the side gain promotion to the Primeira Liga and established themselves as a top-flight club. Etebo had a six-month loan spell at Spanish side Las Palmas in the 2017–18 season. Etebo joined English side Stoke City in June 2018 for a fee of £6.35 million. Etebo joined Warri Wolves in 2012, Etebo was announced as a member of the senior squad for the 2013 Nigeria Premier League season. However, due to his school studies and a delayed start to the league season, he only got to make his professional debut on 14 April 2013, announcing himself to Nigerian fans by scoring the first hat-trick of the season. With his goals in the 4th, 9th and 37th minutes and another by Joseph Osadiaye in the 12th minute as Wolves were up by four goals in the first half against El-Kanemi Warriors. His excellent debut season continued when he scored the fastest hat-trick in the league in a 3–1 win against Wikki Tourists, scoring all three goals within 22 minutes of play. Etebo opened scoring for Wolves in the seventh minute of the game, but the celebrations had yet to die down when Waziri Christopher equalized for Wikki. Etebo struck again in the 12th minute to restore Wolves' lead, and he completed his hat-trick in the 29th minute, after the hosts were awarded a spot kick. In March 2014, he scored his first continental goal against Union Douala in the 2014 CAF Confederation Cup.

In May 2014 Etebo had a trial at Italian club Udinese. In 2015 Etebo received the Glo Wondergoal award, for the best goal of the 2015 Nigeria Professional Football League season, which was scored against Bayelsa United.

He became new manager Gary Rowett's first signing at Stoke, who described him as an 'energetic midfielder'. Etebo revealed that he turned down offers from Premier League clubs before joining Stoke. He made his Stoke debut on 5 August 2018 against Leeds United. Etebo played 37 times in 2018–19 and was one of the teams's better performers as Stoke finished in 16th position. He scored twice both of which were powerful strikes against Nottingham Forest and Blackburn Rovers. Etebo had a delayed start to the 2019–20 season due to his involvement with Nigeria at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Stoke began the season in terrible form and found themselves in the Championship relegation places which cost manager Nathan Jones his job in November 2019. Under new manager Michael O'Neill, Etebo was dropped from the squad with O'Neill critical of his efforts in training. This lead him to being linked with a move away from the club in January 2020.
