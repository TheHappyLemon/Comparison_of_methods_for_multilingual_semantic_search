She appeared as Toast the Knowing in George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), and has starred in numerous independent films including Dope (2015), Gemini (2017), and Kimi (2022). She voiced Mary Jane Parker in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), and played Catwoman in the animated The Lego Batman Movie (2017) and the live-action DC film The Batman (2022), the latter earning her nominations for a Saturn Award among other accolades. She is set to make her directorial debut with Blink Twice, which she also co-wrote and co-produced. Time named Kravitz one of the 100 Most Influential People in 2022. She works as a fashion model and musician, and has starred in campaigns for Tiffany & Co., Vera Wang, Balenciaga, Alexander Wang, Coach New York, Tumi, and Calvin Klein. As of 2017, Kravitz is the face of YSL Beauté. She also fronts the band Lolawolf and released the albums Calm Down in 2014 and Tenderness in 2020. Kravitz was born in Venice, Los Angeles at the home of her parents, musician Lenny Kravitz and actress Lisa Bonet. Both her parents are of half African-American and half-Jewish descent. Her paternal grandmother, actress Roxie Roker (a first cousin once removed of television weather forecaster Al Roker), and her maternal grandfather, Allen Bonet, were African American, with some of her grandmother's family being from The Bahamas. Her paternal grandfather, NBC television news producer Sy Kravitz, and maternal grandmother, Arlene Litman, were both Ashkenazi Jews. Kravitz's paternal grandfather's family emigrated from Russia. Kravitz identifies as a secular Jew. The song "Flowers for Zoë", included on her father's second album Mama Said, was written as a tribute to the two-year-old Zoë. Kravitz's parents married in 1987 and divorced six years later, in 1993, when Zoë was five years old. She lived with her mother in Topanga Canyon and then moved to Miami at age 11 to live with her father, spending summers with her mother. Kravitz has two half-siblings from her mother's second marriage to actor Jason Momoa. Her godfather is movie producer Bruce Cohen, and her godmothers are actresses Marisa Tomei and Cree Summer. Kravitz attended Miami Country Day School and Rudolf Steiner School in Manhattan graduating in 2007. Kravitz began studying that year at the acting conservatory under Scott McCrea at the State University of New York at Purchase where her peers included Micah Stock and Jason Ralph. She left college after a year and moved to Brooklyn, New York to work in films. She struggled with anorexia and bulimia throughout high school, until around age 24. It was in Topanga Canyon that Zoë joined local drama clubs and staged shows at her grandmother's house, usually reenacting “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” It was here, too, where she gained her education in film history, and where her mother encouraged her to watch favorites from her own childhood, imprinting the qualities and skills of what makes a lasting performance and what drives an inspired character onto a new generation. Kravitz landed her first film role while in high school, playing a babysitter hired by Catherine Zeta-Jones's character in the 2007 romantic comedy No Reservations. In the same year she also appeared in the action thriller The Brave One. In 2008, Kravitz appeared in the music video for Jay Z's "I Know" and was featured singing in will.i.am's music video for "We Are the Ones", in support of US presidential candidate Barack Obama. That same year she also appeared in the family drama Birds of America and neo noir comedy Assassination of a High School President. She began making music at the age of 16. She fronted the New York/Philadelphia-based band Elevator Fight, which she formed in 2009. The band performed at the South by Southwest music festival and on the main stage of the Roots Picnic in Philadelphia in June 2009, along with The Roots, TV On The Radio, and The Black Keys. Kravitz stated in 2011 that her music is a hobby. She also performed with the cabaret troupe The Citizens Band. In 2009, Kravitz co-starred in the independent ensemble drama The Greatest, in which her character is addicted to grief counseling groups. Also in 2009, she was named the face of Vera Wang's Princess fragrance in 2009, appearing on the website and in advertisements for the brand. In 2010, she appeared in It's Kind of a Funny Story.

She also appeared in eight episodes of the Showtime television series Californication, in which she portrayed Pearl, the vocalist of the all-female band Queens of Dogtown. That same year she portrayed the comic book character Angel Salvadore in X-Men: First Class. Kravitz filmed her scenes in London and performed wire work for her role, to simulate her character's ability to fly. In late 2011, Kravitz completed work on a film with the working title Treading Water, which was eventually released in 2013, renamed The Boy Who Smells Like Fish. In the same year, she represented Vera Wang's new Preppy Princess fragrance. In 2013, she co-starred in After Earth. In 2013, Kravitz released a jewelry line in collaboration with the Swarovski crystal company. She used ethnic and vintage jewelry, and her birthstone, Turquoise, as inspiration for her designs. In 2014, she portrayed the character Christina in Divergent. Kravitz reprised her role in the sequels Insurgent and Allegiant. Also in 2014, she starred in the independent drama The Road Within and the romantic comedy Pretend We're Kissing. Kravitz started the band Lolawolf while in Los Angeles filming The Road Within. Made up of members from the band Reputante, Lolawolf released an eponymous EP and debuted at the Mercury Lounge in November 2013. The band was named after Kravitz's younger siblings, Lola and Nakoa-Wolf. They released their debut album, Calm Down, on October 21, 2014, and supported Lily Allen, Miley Cyrus, and Warpaint on tour in 2014. The band released the five-track EP, Every Fuckin Day, on June 23, 2015. Kravitz appeared in 2014's Good Kill. In 2015, she appeared in the comedy-drama Dope and in Mad Max: Fury Road.

She was also featured on "Anti-Social Smokers Club" on Rae Sremmurd's third album SR3MM. In 2019, Kravitz was cast as the lead in the Hulu romantic comedy television series High Fidelity, based on the 2000 film of the same name in which her mother stars. The series premiered on Valentine's Day, 2020 to critical acclaim with Kravitz's performance as Rob Gorgan receiving praise. Margaret Lyons of The New York Times described her performance as "mesmerizing", adding "She's so good, in fact, that it's almost impossible to believe she can't find someone to love her exactly as-is." Alison Herman of The Ringer called Kravitz a "bona-fide leading lady". Despite the critical success, High Fidelity was cancelled after one season. For her role in the series, Kravitz won a Black Reel Award and was nominated for a Satellite Award. Also in 2020, she starred as one of the leads in Viena and the Fantomes. Kravitz portrayed Selina Kyle / Catwoman, now in live action, in director Matt Reeves' The Batman, which was released on March 4, 2022, to critical and commercial success, grossing over $700 million internationally. Kravitz's performance received positive reviews. The Independent wrote that "Kravitz's Catwoman brings an almost-extinct sensuality to the role", and in Christy Lemire's review of the film—written for RogerEbert.com—she stated that "This is no flirty, purring Catwoman: She's a fighter and a survivor with a loyal heart and a strong sense of what's right. ... Kravitz continues to reveal a fierce charisma and quiet strength." She earned several award nominations for her performance, including the Saturn Award for Best Actress. Kravitz starred in filmmaker Steven Soderbergh's thriller Kimi, which was released to generally positive reviews with her performance receiving praise. In June 2021, Kravitz announced plans to make her directorial debut in Blink Twice, a film she also co-wrote.
