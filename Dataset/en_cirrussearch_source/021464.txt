Maksims Uvarenko (born 17 January 1987 in Ventspils) is a Latvian football goalkeeper. Uvarenko signed a contract with Slovan Liberec in January 2006. He made his debut the following year. Being a bright talent in Latvia, he played for many Latvian national youth teams. It was difficult for him to find a place in the starting line-up, since he joined the team, so he signed a contract with the Czech 2. Liga club Vysočina Jihlava in February 2010, hoping to become the first choice keeper there. In 2012, Uvarenko joined his former club FK Ventspils in the Latvian Higher League. On 13 January 2015, Uvarenko signed with CSKA Sofia in Bulgaria on a one-and-a-half-year deal. He kept a clean sheet in his official debut for the "redmen" on 21 March 2015 – a 0:0 home draw with Beroe. Uvarenko played for the Latvian U-17 in 2003.
