The genus Hylobates /ˌhaɪloʊˈbeɪtiːz/ is one of the four genera of gibbons. Its name means "forest walker", from the Greek hūlē (ὕλη, "forest") and bates (βάτης, "one who treads"). It was once considered the only genus, but recently its subgenera (Hoolock [formerly Bunopithecus], Nomascus, and Symphalangus) have been elevated to the genus level. Hylobates remains the most species-rich and widespread of gibbon genera, ranging from southern China (Yunnan) to western and central Java. Individuals within this genus are characterized by 44 chromosomes and often have a ring of white fur around their faces.
