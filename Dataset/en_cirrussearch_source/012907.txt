Decapodiformes is a superorder of Cephalopoda comprising all cephalopod species with ten limbs, specifically eight short arms and two long tentacles. It is hypothesized that the ancestral coleoid had five identical pairs of limbs, and that one branch of descendants evolved a modified arm pair IV to become the Decapodiformes, while another branch of descendants evolved and then eventually lost its arm pair II, becoming the Octopodiformes. The following orders are recognised in the superorder Decapodiformes: Bathyteuthida †Belemnitida †Diplobelida Idiosepida Myopsida – coastal squid Oegopsida – neritic squid Sepiida – cuttlefish, pygmy, bobtail and bottletail squid Spirulida – ram's horn squid see Boletzkyida, Belemnite Young, R.
