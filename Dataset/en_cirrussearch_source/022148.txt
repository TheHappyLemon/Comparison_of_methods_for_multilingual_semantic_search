Speed skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics was held at the Adler Arena, Sochi, Russia, between 8 and 22 February 2014. The following is the competition schedule for all twelve events. With the exception of the Team pursuit events, all rounds of each event were concluded within a single session. All times are (UTC+4). Netherlands dominated in speed skating, winning a total of 23 medals including eight out of the twelve gold medals and medals in all events. There were four Dutch podium sweeps where the Netherlands won the gold, silver and bronze medal, making the Netherlands the first country in Olympic speed skating history to achieve this. The events were the: Men's 5000m, Men's 500m, Women's 1500m and Men's 10,000m. In the women's 1,500 metres, Dutch athletes placed 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th; the first such result in Olympic speed skating history by athletes from a single nation. On 24 November 2017 the silver medal of Olga Fatkulina was disqualified as part of the Russian team doping case. On 1 February 2018, Olga Fatkulina successfully appealed against IOC decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. As a result, her silver medal was reinstated.
