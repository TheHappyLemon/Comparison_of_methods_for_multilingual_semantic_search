The first mention of Zhashkiv was found in documents of the beginning of the 17th century, the town was officially mentioned on October 16 (according to the old style) in 1636 - a report that at the confluence of the Kozina Rudka river with the Rava Zhashkivska river, above the Skybyn Dam, a settlement was laid.

From the end of the 18th century, the settlement became part of the Moscowia. Since 1796, Zhashkiv belongs to the Poles - Hryhoriy Zakrevskiy, two years later - Jan Tarnowiecki. After the death of Tarnovetskyi's son Jan in 1852, Zhashkiv was divided into two parts between the sisters Solomiya Rakovskaya and Palageya Charkovskaya. In 1840, Zhashkiv was classified as a small town.

In 1917, Zhashkiv became part of the newly created Ukrainian People's Republic. The first occupation of communist Moscow in February-March 1918 did not affect the Zhashkiv too much. After the Hetman coup and the beginning of the repression of the Hetman government and the German occupiers against the peasantry, on June 8, 1918, a partisan unit from Zhashkiv arrived in nearby Stryzhavka to participate in the uprising against the Hetman government and the German occupiers. The second occupation of communist Moscow, under which Zhashkiv fell in March 1919, caused an active insurgent movement there, directed against it. Since 1922, Zhashkiv has been part of the USSR.
