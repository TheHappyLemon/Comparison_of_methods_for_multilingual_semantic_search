The Stade de la Mosson (French pronunciation: [stad də la mɔˈsɔ̃]) is a football stadium in Montpellier, France. It is the home of Ligue 1 club Montpellier HSC, and has a capacity of 32,900. Formerly a 16,000-seater stadium, it was entirely rebuilt in 1998 to host 6 games of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. It was also used as a venue for group stage matches in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and was one of nine venues used in the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The stadium takes its name from the neighbouring Mosson river. In October 2014, the stadium flooded twice as over 30 centimeters (12 inches) of rain fell in Montpellier. The stadium and pitch were damaged, and this resulted in Montpellier HSC relocating for 5 fixtures during the 2014–15 season (4 Ligue 1 matches and 1 Coupe de la Ligue match) to the Altrad Stadium, until repairs had been made to the stadium. The relocation lasted for the remainder of 2014, the first fixture on 28 October, and the last being 13 December. The flooding caused Montpellier to cancel their 40-year anniversary celebration.[citation needed] The stadium was one of the venues for the 1998 FIFA World Cup.
