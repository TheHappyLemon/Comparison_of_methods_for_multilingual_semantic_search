During winter break 2007–08 Rotan was transferred back to his home club of Dnipro. The transfer fee was undisclosed. However, he signed a three-year contract with Dnipro. He now wears the number 29 jersey. He became the top assister of the Ukrainian Premier League of the season 2008–2009. In the summer of 2014, after his Dnipro contract had expired, Rotan went on trial with Rubin Kazan, nearly signing with the club before turning down the offer due to the political situation around the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Rotan eventually signed a new three-year contract with Dnipro on 8 August 2014.[citation needed] In the 2014–15 season, Rotan helped Dnipro reach the UEFA Europa League Final in Warsaw on 27 May 2015, in which he equalised the score at 2–2 with a free kick against holders Sevilla FC, who eventually won 3–2. Rotan made his debut for Ukraine on 12 February 2003, replacing Andriy Voronin for the final eight minutes of a goalless friendly against Turkey in İzmir. He scored three goals in seven games in 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification, going on to play three of their five matches (one start) as they reached the quarter-finals at the tournament. When Ukraine hosted UEFA Euro 2012, he played five minutes as a substitute for Voronin in their opening 2–1 victory over Sweden at the Olympic Stadium in Kyiv. With 100 caps, Rotan is Ukraine's third-most capped player of all time. He was also on Ukraine's World cup 2006 squad.
