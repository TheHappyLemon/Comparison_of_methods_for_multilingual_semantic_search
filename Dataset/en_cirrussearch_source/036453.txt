Rich√°rd Rapport (born 25 March 1996) is a Hungarian chess grandmaster currently playing for Romania. A chess prodigy, he earned his grandmaster title at the age of 13 years, 11 months, and six days, making him Hungary's youngest ever grandmaster. He was the Hungarian Chess Champion in 2017 and was the fifth-rated player in the world in May 2022. Rapport was born in Szombathely, Hungary, to Tam√°s Rapport and Erzs√©bet M√≥rocz, both economists. He learned chess at age four from his father. In 2006, he won the European Championships U10. Rapport achieved the National Master title in 2008 and became an International Master the next year. In March 2010, at the Gotth'Art Kupa in Szentgotth√°rd, he fulfilled the final norm and rating requirements for the Grandmaster title. He came in second on the tournament behind his trainer Alexander Beliavsky and tied with Lajos Portisch (one of the strongest non-Soviet players in the second half of the 20th century). Thus, at the age of 13 years, 11 months and 6 days, he became the youngest ever Hungarian grandmaster (the previous record was held by former world title challenger P√©ter L√©k√≥), and the fifth youngest chess grandmaster in history at the time. In May, Rapport tied for first in the Sigeman & Co Chess Tournament, together with Nigel Short and Nils Grandelius, winning on tiebreaks (head-to-head result). He scored 4¬Ω/7 (+3‚àí1=3). In December, Rapport won the European Rapid Chess Championship and finished fourth in the European Blitz Chess Championship. From 20 to 23 December, Rapport won a match against 17-year-old Chinese player Wei Yi, held in Yancheng, China. At the time, Rapport was the highest rated junior (under 21) player at 2717, and Wei Yi was the second-highest rated at 2707. They tied a match of four classical games with a win each and two draws, then tied a tiebreak match of two blitz games, winning one each. The final tiebreak of the match was an Armageddon game, which Rapport won with the black pieces by resignation. At the Tata Steel Chess Tournament in January 2017 he played his first game against Magnus Carlsen and won with White in 33 moves. He won the Hungarian Chess Championship in May 2017. He also won the tournament that was covered by Grandmaster Simon Williams in his show called Checkmate, finishing ahead of top seed Arkadij Naiditsch and World Championship challenger Nigel Short. Rapport won against Sam Shankland in their match, which was part of the USA vs. The World tournament. Rapport won the 11th Danzhou Tournament. He was the only player to remain undefeated and finished half a point ahead of GM Ding Liren. Rapport won the second leg of the FIDE Grand Prix 2022 in Belgrade, Serbia. That performance, together with reaching the semi-finals in the first leg, was enough to clinch a top-two spot in the Grand Prix and qualify for the 2022 Candidates Tournament, where he finished last with a score of 5¬Ω/14. In May 2022, Rapport announced his intention to switch federations and represent Romania, as part of a sponsorship deal with Serbian-owned Superbet Romania. It was officially announced that he would be switching federations in September 2022. Rapport was one of the participants of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2023, in which he had a rough start by losing to chess prodigy Nodirbek Abdusattorov and later losing to World Champion Magnus Carlsen. However, he came back to defeat Indian grandmaster Arjun Erigaisi, and later in round 12 snatched a victory against the World No. 2 Chinese Grandmaster Ding Liren. Rapport finished the tournament placing 8th out of 14 with a score of 6¬Ω/13. Rapport also played the role of Ding's second during the World Chess Championship 2023, in which Ding won against Ian Nepomniachtchi. He has lived in Belgrade, Serbia, since the age of 18, where his wife Jovana Vojinoviƒá, a Woman Grandmaster, is from. They married in 2016. Rapport often uses unusual openings even in official over-the-board tournaments. One of the most common of these is the Nimzo‚ÄìLarsen Attack, also known as Larsen's Opening. He plays aggressively, normally playing for a win with both White and Black and is considered one of the more exciting players to watch. This section uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
