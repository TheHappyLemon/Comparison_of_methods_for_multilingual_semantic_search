"We Are the Champions" is a song by the British rock band Queen, released from the band's sixth album News of the World (1977). Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, it remains among rock's most recognisable anthems. The song was a worldwide success, reaching number two in the UK, number four on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, number three in Canada, and the top ten in many other countries. In 2009 it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and was voted the world's favourite song in a 2005 Sony Ericsson world music poll. Written with audience participation in mind, Mercury said "We" in the song's title refers to everyone who is singing it. Brian May called the song "unifying and positive". "We Are the Champions" has become an anthem for victories at sporting events, including as an official theme song for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and has been often used or referenced in popular culture. The song has also been covered by many artists. On 7 October 2017, Queen released a Raw Sessions version of the track to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of News of the World. It was made from previously unheard vocal and instrumental takes from the original multi-track tapes. It also presents for the first time the original recorded length of the track, which is two choruses more than the 1977 edited single. Written by Freddie Mercury, "We Are the Champions" was built on audience response following a concert at Bingley Hall, Stafford in which the audience sang "You'll Never Walk Alone" to the band. It embodies numerous elements of arena rock, with Brian May stating, "We wanted to get the crowds waving and singing. It's very unifying and positive." "We Are the Champions" Featuring Mercury on piano, Classic FM called "We Are the Champions" a "bombastic monument of an anthem", with "its soaring, triumphant melody known at sporting events and award ceremonies the world over".

May overdubbed some guitar sections, initially subtle, but building to a "solo" played simultaneously with the last chorus. Mercury employed many jazz chords (major and minor 6th, 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th harmonies), and the choruses featured these voiced as four- and five-part vocal harmonies. The lead vocal is very demanding and strident (highest point is a C5 both belted and in falsetto), with one of Mercury's most notable performances taking place at the Live Aid concert, at Wembley Stadium, London in 1985. The single featured "We Will Rock You", which preceded the song on the album, as its B-side. The two songs were often played consecutively at the close of Queen concerts, and are customarily played together on radio broadcasts (in album order). Keeping with tradition, the two songs were also used to close the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert with all the show's acts joining in behind the lead vocal of Liza Minnelli. Cash Box said that it contains "heroic lyrics and rapid changes in dynamics and emotional intensity" and praised guitarist Brian May's "dark backing lines and rippling fills." Record World called it a "stately rocker well-suited to its title" and suggested that "it could serve as a sort of new wave anthem." The video for "We Are the Champions" was filmed at a special video shoot with fan club members at the New London Theatre on 6 October 1977 and was directed by Derek Burbridge. Mercury performs in a trademark Harlequin outfit – a half black, half white version – in front of an enthusiastic crowd who wave Queen scarves in a manner similar to English football fans. An alternate version which starts in monochrome before blasting into colour as the drums and guitars kick in was broadcast on the BBC's Top of the Pops 2 and comprises alternate footage shot on the same day. "In some ways the definitive Queen song, from its balladic verses to its anthemic chorus, "Champions" has an eternal lock on sports stadium playlists." —Gary Graff for Billboard magazine, January 2018. In 2011, a team of scientific researchers concluded that "We Are the Champions" was the catchiest song in the history of pop music, despite its not reaching #1 in the charts in any major market. Dr. Daniel Mullensiefen said of the study: "Every musical hit is reliant on maths, science, engineering and technology; from the physics and frequencies of sound that determine pitch and harmony, to the hi-tech digital processors and synthesisers which can add effects to make a song catchier. We've discovered that there's a science behind the sing-along and a special combination of neuroscience, math and cognitive psychology that can produce the elusive elixir of the perfect sing-along song." The song is popular at sporting events, often being played after a major victory by the home team. For example, it was played at Highmark Stadium after the Buffalo Bills defeated the New England Patriots in the 2021 NFL playoffs. In 1977–1978, "We Are the Champions" was released as a single in many countries, reaching number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. number 4 on Billboard in the US, number 3 in Canada, the top 10 in Ireland, Netherlands, and Norway, and the top 15 in Germany, Austria, and Sweden. In 1992, 1993, and 1998, the single was re-released in France, totalling 45 weeks on the chart and peaking at #19, #14, and at #10 during the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Information is based on the album's Liner Notes Freddie Mercury – lead and backing vocals, piano Brian May – electric guitar, backing vocals Roger Taylor – drums, backing vocals John Deacon – bass guitar In 1992, Hank Marvin recorded a version of the song featuring Brian May on guitar. Royalties from the single were donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust. The song peaked at number 66 on the UK charts.

This special version was recorded in honour of Michael Schumacher winning his seventh F1 Formula One Championship. The song was slightly re-written, most notably changing "We" to "You" which is a direct reference to Schumacher. The song peaked at number 92 on the German Singles Chart. It was subsequently included on the album Stand Up for the Champion – Michael Schumacher in 2006 when he decided to retire from Formula One racing.

Vocal arrangements include a sample portion of Queen's original recording. The music video depicts Crazy Frog in bed dreaming that he is competing in a football match against Killbots. When the music video was originally released online, it appeared as it was released. However, the current version lacks the ball being kicked and the accompanying sound effects. After being internationally released, it was shown before the animated movie Cars. The single had its greatest success in France. It went straight to #1 on 10 June 2006, and stayed at this position for five weeks. It remained for nine weeks in the Top 10, seventeen weeks in the top fifty, and twenty five weeks in the chart. On 30 August 2006, it was certified Gold disc two months after its release by SNEP, the French certifier, and became the fifteenth best selling single in 2006 in that country.
