Corruption scandal at the level of financial market supervision institution added to this turmoil. As a result of this instability, the Latvian financial market supervision institutions and legislators adopted a range of decisions that considerably restricted banks’ cooperation with non-resident customers, especially high risk clients. At this point, Rietumu Bank made a decision to considerably change its business model, focusing its activities on servicing Latvian customers and customers from other Baltic and OECD states. As part of transformation of this business model, Rietumu Bank terminated cooperation with nearly 4000 high-risk customers. This work was highly assessed by both Latvian supervisory bodies and foreign partners. At this point the bank's management was changed as well, and the responsibility for the implementation of the new business model was vested in Rolf Fuls, an experienced representative of Rietumu Bank management. The main regions for the bank's activities are now becoming the Baltics and other EU countries. Rietumu Bank continues focusing on the servicing of corporate clients and affluent individuals. One of the focuses of the new strategy is business lending, which already brings positive results within a short period.

Performance: The bank presents its financial results as a collective "Group". The companies within the Group receive their financing from the Bank, either through loans or capital investments. The Bank typically owns all of the shares of its subsidiaries, meaning it has full ownership and control over them. Profitability: In 2021, the Group's net income attributable to equity holders of the Bank rose to EUR 27 million from EUR 10 million in 2020. In 2021, the Group's operating income increased to EUR 82 million, up from EUR 69 million in 2020. This represents a significant increase in profitability, with the Group achieving an after-tax return on equity of 8.41% (2021) vs 3.59% (2020).    Financial Statements: As of December 31, 2021, the Group's total assets amounted to EUR 1.5 billion. The Group adopts a conservative approach to asset allocation, with approximately 45% of its assets invested in liquidity management portfolios. The bond portfolio is primarily composed of investment-grade securities issued by corporations, reflecting the Group's commitment to maintaining a high standard of credit quality in its investment strategy. Group's Liabilities for accounts and deposits account for EUR 1 billion. As of December 31, 2021, the total shareholders' equity of the Group amounted to EUR 355 million. In 2017, a first-instance court in Paris ruled that Rietumu Bank had to pay a EUR 80 million fine as part of proceedings initiated earlier against the French company France Offshore over tax evasion. The bank filed an appeal and in 2021 the Court of Appeal largely reversed the first-instance court's decision in favour of the bank. The international press called this decision of the court a victory for Rietumu. The Court of Appeal reduced the fine to EUR 20 million. Rietumu commented that it was not guilty and was prepared to defend its position “using the opportunities provided by the EU legal system.” The bank also said that it had well in advance made provisions for potential penalties. Another controversial development occurred in 2018 when, during a campaign for an “overhaul of the financial system of Latvia”, Rietumu blocked some clients’ accounts and eventually terminated cooperation with these clients by closing their accounts.
