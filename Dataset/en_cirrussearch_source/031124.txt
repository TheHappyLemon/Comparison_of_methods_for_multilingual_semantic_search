In February 2008, Vodafone recalled 3,000 of their branded Nokia 6110 Navigators due to problems with its GPS application. It packs many features with HSDPA and integrated GPS and Bluetooth.

These can be downloaded to the user's PC using Nokia Map Loader (requires Microsoft .NET Framework) or simply double clicking on the downloaded .SIS file with the phone connected to Nokia PC Suite by the data cable, and finishing the installation on the phone. The whole process takes approximately 15 minutes. The maps are installed to the data card and appear in the maps section as World Maps. Installing the maps does not affect the GPS Voice Navigation if this service is already being provided by the sim card provider. If the text, Street not Digitised Appears, the user can just zoom to current GPS location to enhance map magnification. NAVTEQ's website provides users with a Map Reporter function where users can report missing streets, missing features, restriction, points of interest, errors in the spelling of street names for the Nokia 6110 Navigator. Users are encouraged to report variations in the interests of improving navigation. List of Nokia products "Nokia 6110 Navigator technical details at Forum Nokia".
