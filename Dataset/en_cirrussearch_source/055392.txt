The 2021 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships (2021 WJHC) were the 45th edition of the Ice Hockey World Junior Championship. It began on December 25, 2020, and ended with the gold medal game on January 5, 2021. This marked the 16th time that Canada hosted the WJIHC. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, it was hosted in a "bubble" behind closed doors in Edmonton, Alberta, with no spectators admitted for any game. On December 6, 2018, it was announced that Edmonton and Red Deer, in the province of Alberta, would be the host cities. It was the third time Edmonton has hosted the tournament, after previously hosting in 1995 and 2012, and the first to use Rogers Place as a venue. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IIHF cancelled all lower-division U20 championships on September 17, 2020 (thus there was no promotion or relegation), and announced that the top division tournament would be hosted solely by Edmonton using a "bubble" strategy similar to what was used for the NHL's 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs in Edmonton and Toronto. This decision resulted in the elimination of Red Deer as the secondary host city of the 2021 tournament. All games were held behind closed doors with no outside spectators. It was subsequently announced that Edmonton and Red Deer would host the 2022 tournament, and that Gothenburg, Sweden would be shifted from 2022 to 2024. On October 19, 2020, the full schedule for the tournament was announced, with play beginning on Christmas for the first time since the 2004–05 edition. On November 25, 2020, Hockey Canada suspended its selection camp and quarantined all players for 14 days (retroactive to November 23) due to two positive COVID-19 tests among participants. Swedish head coach Tomas Montén, along with two assistant leaders and players William Eklund, Karl Henriksson, William Wallinder, and Albin Grewe from the Swedish preliminary roster, were forced to leave the team after testing positive for COVID-19 too close to the beginning of the championship. Team Canada captain Kirby Dach sustained an injury in Canada's pre-tournament game against Russia, and was ruled out for the rest of the tournament. Nine German players were quarantined under COVID-19 protocols through the first two games due to positive tests prior to the tournament. No new COVID-19 positives were detected within the bubble through the conclusion of the tournament. Blackhawks prospect and 2020 first rounder and Team Germany forward Lukas Reichel was unable to make the tournament after he tested positive with COVID-19. The following officials were assigned by the IIHF to officiate the 2021 World Junior Championships. All officials are Canadian due to restrictions from COVID-19 pandemic on travel and ease of getting officials on site.
