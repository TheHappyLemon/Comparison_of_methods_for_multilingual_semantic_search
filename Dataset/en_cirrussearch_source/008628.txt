Jānis Timma (born 2 July 1992) is a Latvian professional basketball player for Monbus Obradoiro of the Liga ACB. He also represents the senior Latvian national team. At a height of 2.01 m (6 ft 7 in), he plays mainly at the small forward position. Timma grew up playing basketball in his hometown of Krāslava, but he later moved to Rīga at age 15. At first he joined ASK Rīga's youth system, and made a few appearances for its senior team, during the end of the 2008–09 season. The following year, ASK Riga was dissolved and he played with DSN Rīga, a team that consisted of young Latvian talents. Timma helped DSN Rīga to win the Latvian 2nd division in the 2009–10 season. He also spent the majority of the next season playing with DSN Rīga. Timma joined Liepājas Lauvas for the 2011–12 season. That can be considered his first real season at the pro level. After a decent season in Liepāja, Timma made the next step in his career. On 1 August 2012, he signed a multi-year contract with Ventspils. In April 2013, he led Ventspils to the Baltic Basketball League championship, and he won the Finals MVP award. In his second season with Ventspils, Timma won his first Latvian League championship, and he was named the MVP of the playoffs. On 28 July 2014, he signed with the Latvian club VEF Rīga, where he played for the first time in such quality competition as the European-wide secondary league, the EuroCup, and the VTB United League. Timma was named the MVP of the 2015 Latvian Basketball League All-Star Game, after he scored 41 points, and set a new scoring record. On 5 May 2015, he was named the VTB United League Young Player of the Year. He finished the season with VEF Rīga, by winning the Latvian League (LBL) championship. In total, he played in 58 games with VEF Riga, averaging 12.6 points per game, in all the competitions that his team participated in.

His stint in Greece proved unsuccessful and he was loaned to fellow EuroLeague club Khimki Moscow on 12 March 2019 for the remainder of the 2018–19 season. On 27 June 2019 Timma signed on to continue playing for the Russian team with a two-year contract. On 15 November 2021 Timma signed a temporary deal with UNICS Kazan of the VTB United League.
