Born in Lagos, Nigeria, Taiwo began his football career at Nigeria Division 1 club Gabros International and Nigeria Premier League side, Lobi Stars. On 10 January 2005, at the age of 20, Taiwo moved to France when he was signed by French club, Marseille, signing a three–year contract, with a reported transfer fee costing 200,000 euros.

After the match, Foot Marseille said about Taiwo's performance: "For his debut in White, this athletic Nigerian started well with a goal ball for Luyindula and a few good interventions then seemed completely lost on the pitch never knowing how to position himself. His second half confirmed these incredible mistakes. He will hardly be able to do worse but given his age and his physique, he will surely speak of him better, much better." After sitting for the next six matches due to competitions from fellow left–back players Salomon Olembé and Kōji Nakata, Taiwo went on to start the remaining three matches of the 2004–05 season, as the club went on to finish fifth place in the league.

Despite reports claimed that Queens Park Rangers would be interested in signing Taiwo on a permanent basis, and the player, himself, would like to stay at the club, the club decided against signing him and he returned to his parent club.

Taiwo then scored his third Nigeria goal, in a 1–0 win against Switzerland on 19 November 2007. In December 2007, he was called up to the national team squad for the tournament. Taiwo eventually made it to the 23 men squad the following month. He started in all four matches in the African Cup of Nations, as Nigeria were eliminated in the quarter–finals following a 2–1 loss against Ghana. Following the conclusion to the Africa Cup of Nations, Taiwo kept Nigeria six consecutive clean sheets in the World Cup qualifying round between 1 June 2008 and 1 September 2008. However, he was sent–off for a second bookable offence, in a 0–0 draw against Jamaica on 11 February 2009. Taiwo later helped Nigeria qualify for the FIFA World Cup after beating Kenya 3–2 on 14 November 2009. In January 2010, Taiwo made the Nigeria cut when he was called up to the national team squad for the Africa Cup of Nations. Taiwo started the whole game on Matchday 1 Group stage, in a 3–1 loss against Egypt on 12 January 2010. However, he remained on the substitute bench in Nigeria's next four matches, with Elderson Echiéjilé preferred in the left–back position. It wasn't until on 30 January 2010 when Taiwo returned to the starting line–up against Algeria for the third place play–offs and helped the national team side win 1–0 to earn a bronze medal. In April 2010, Taiwo were among forty–four players to be shortlisted for the Nigeria squad ahead of the FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Eventually, he made the cut to be in the World Cup squad after Manager Lars Lagerbäck cut the squad to 23. Taiwo made his World Cup debut against Argentina on 12 June 2010 and started a match before suffering an injury in the 74th minute, resulting in him being substituted. After the match, he quickly recovered from his injury following an operation and returned to the starting line–up against Greece and played 55 minutes before being substituted, as the national team lost 2–1. Following this, Taiwo was once again injured and sidelined for the follow–up against South Korea, resulting in Nigeria's elimination following a 2–2 draw. Following the end of the World Cup, Taiwo featured four times in the African Cup of Nations qualification, as Nigeria were eliminated in the qualification round. Between 2004 and 2012, he played 53 games for the national team and scored 5 goals. Having not played for Nigeria since 2012, Manager Stephen Keshi said in 2012 about Taiwo, saying: "I am still working on my list but Taiwo, like other players, is under consideration."
