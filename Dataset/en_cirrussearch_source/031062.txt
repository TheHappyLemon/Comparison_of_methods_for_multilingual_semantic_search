Public prosecutor's offices are criminal justice bodies attached to the judiciary. They are separate from the courts in Germany, Austria and the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, and are called the Staatsanwaltschaft (German: [ˈʃtaːt͡sʔanˌvaltʃaft] ). This kind of office also exists in Mainland China, Taiwan and Macau (which continues to follow the Portuguese legal system), and in some countries in Central Europe including Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Poland and the Czech Republic.
