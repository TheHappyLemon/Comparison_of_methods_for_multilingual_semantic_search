Uetersen (German pronunciation: [ˈyːtɐzn̩] , formerly known as Ütersen (Holstein)) is a town in the district of Pinneberg, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is situated approximately 7 km (4.3 mi) south of Elmshorn, and 30 km (19 mi) northwest of Hamburg at the small Pinnau River, close to the Elbe river. Uetersen is home to the Rosarium Uetersen, the oldest and largest rose garden in Northern Germany, created in 1929. The name of the city Uetersen, "utmost end", probably arose because it is "at the extreme end", referring to the fact that its location is at the transition to the geest Seestermüher marsh. But there is also the suspicion that the name of "Ütersteen" showing what "ultra-stone" or "Ütristina", the old name of Pinnau originates.[clarification needed] 1803: 2601 1855: 3906 1871: 4037 1905: 6300 1935: 7236 1951: 15485 1995: 18155 2007: 17852 2008: 17739 2009: 17688 2010: 17558 2011: 17829 Blazon:In a red shield is a silver (= white) gate without any door.
