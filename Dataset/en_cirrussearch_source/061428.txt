On December 25, 2011, the city council of Olevsk renamed the streets of the city that bore the names of Soviet leaders, naming them in honor of prominent figures of the Ukrainian nationalist and patriotic movement. The streets and lanes named after Pavlo Postyshev, Stanislav Kosior, Hryhoriy Petrovsky, Mykhailo Kalinin, and Hryhoriy Kotovsky were renamed. Instead, they were named after Olena Teliha, Oleh Olzhych, Hetman Vyhovsky, Oleksiy Opanasiuk, Heroes of Kruty, the 20th anniversary of Ukraine's independence, and Yuriy Tiutiunnyk.
