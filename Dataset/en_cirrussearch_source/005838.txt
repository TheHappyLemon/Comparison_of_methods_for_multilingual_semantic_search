Minsk Gurzuf Belgrade Kyiv The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) invited broadcasters to bid for the rights to host the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2009; three bids were received from Belarus, Serbia, and Ukraine. TV4 of Sweden had originally sent in a bid during summer 2007, but soon withdrew its bid after deciding to completely withdraw from the contest. On 6 June 2008, after deliberations by the EBU, the National Television Company of Ukraine (NTU) was granted the rights to the 2009 contest and confirmed they would host it in Kyiv. An NTU organiser team headed by then-First Lady of Ukraine Kateryna Yushchenko originally proposed a candidacy set in Camp Artek (located in Gurzuf, Crimea) to the EBU during discussions held in Rotterdam as part of the 2007 contest. However, the candidacy of Kyiv, with its proposed location being Eurovision Song Contest 2005 venue Palace of Sports, prevailed due to better infrastructure and the experience in past Eurovision events. On 12 November 2009, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasiunyk declared that the contest would not be postponed; (earlier) Party of Regions member of parliament Hanna Herman had called on Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko to cancel the song contest because of the 2009 flu pandemic in Ukraine. The EBU announced the complete list of participating countries in the 2009 contest on 8 June 2009. 13 countries competed in the contest. Sweden returned after missing the previous year's contest, while Bulgaria, Greece and Lithuania withdrew from the contest. According to the rules of the contest, participants must sing in one of their national languages, however they are permitted to have up to 25% of the song in a different language.[citation needed] Prior to the event, a compilation album featuring all the songs from the 2009 contest, along with karaoke versions, was put together by the European Broadcasting Union and released by Universal Music Group on 21 November 2009. Logo of the contest titled "Tree of life" is based on the artwork "Sunflower of life" by Maria Primachenko, a well known Ukrainian folk art painter. Creative design of the show was based on the logo of the contest, works and ideas of Primachenko as well as on the concept of the show, titled "For the joy of people".[better source needed] On 22 October 2009, it was revealed that Ani Lorak, Timur Miroshnychenko and Dmytro Borodin would be hosting the contest, with Borodin serving as the green room host.
