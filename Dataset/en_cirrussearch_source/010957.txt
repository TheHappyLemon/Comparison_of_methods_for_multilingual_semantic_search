Ilga Manor (Latvian: Ilgas muiža) is a manor in Skrudaliena Parish, Augšdaugava Municipality in the Selonia region of Latvia. Located southeast of Daugavpils near the Belarusian border, it is currently used as a teaching site by the University of Daugavpils. Renovation of the building was completed in 2012 with the help of a grant from the European Regional Development Fund. The manor was built in the 1890s by Baltic German architect Wilhelm Neumann and used as a hunting lodge.
