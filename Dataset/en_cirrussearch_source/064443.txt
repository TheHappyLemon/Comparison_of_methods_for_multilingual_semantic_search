Deschampsia flexuosa, commonly known as wavy hair-grass, is a species of bunchgrass in the grass family widely distributed in Eurasia, Africa, South America, and North America. Wavy hair-grass, Deschampsia flexuosa, has wiry leaves and delicate, shaking panicles formed of silvery or purplish-brown flower heads on wavy, hair-like stalks. The leaves are bunched in tight tufts with plants forming a very tussocky, low sward 5 to 20 cm tall before flowering, to 30 cm high. Illustration of D. flexuosa (including D. caespitosa) Mature inflorescence Deschampsia flexuosa is found naturally in dry grasslands and on moors and heaths. It is also an important component of the ground flora of birch and oak woodland. The plant has a preference for acidic, free-draining soil, and avoids chalk and limestone areas. It can exist over 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) above sea level.
