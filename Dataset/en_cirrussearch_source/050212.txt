Artūrs Šilovs (born March 22, 2001) is a Latvian professional ice hockey goaltender for the Abbotsford Canucks of the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). Šilovs was selected by the Canucks in the sixth round, 156th overall, in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft and made his NHL debut with the team in 2023. Playing with the Latvian national team, Šilovs played a central role in the country's first-ever medal at Ice Hockey World Championships in 2023. Šilovs started his hockey career with HS Riga of the Optibet Hockey League. At the 2019 NHL Entry Draft he was selected by the Vancouver Canucks in the sixth round, 156th overall. He was subsequently selected by the Barrie Colts of the Ontario Hockey League in the 2019 CHL Import Draft, 11th overall, and joined them for the 2019–20 season. Šilovs signed a contract with Vancouver on 23 August 2019. In 2021, he started playing for the Abbotsford Canucks of the American Hockey League, recording a .888 save percentage for the team in 10 games in the 2021–22 season. Šilovs made his NHL debut with the Vancouver Canucks on 15 February 2023, against the New York Rangers. He finished the season playing 5 games for Vancouver and 44 games for Abbotsford, being named the team MVP for Abbotsford. Šilovs made his international debut with the Latvian men's under-18 team at the 2019 World U18 Championships, where his team placed eighth. Three years later, he accepted his first invitation to join the senior national team at the 2022 World Championships, where he played four games and recorded a .952 save percentage. He began the tournament as backup goaltender to Columbus Blue Jackets starter Elvis Merzļikins, but was judged to have significantly outperformed Merzļikins during the tournament, and was given the start in the team's final game in the group stage. Latvia did not advance to the knockout rounds. After his strong showing at the 2022 championships, Šilovs rejoined the national team for the 2023 World Championships, which was jointly hosted by Latvia and Finland. Šilovs relieved goaltender Ivars Punnenovs early in the team's first game of the tournament, and thereafter started every game for Latvia, leading them on an unexpected deep run to the bronze medal game. There they defeated the heavily-favoured Team USA, winning the bronze medal, the first of any colour for Latvia at an IIHF World Championship. Šilovs played more than sixty minutes more than any other goaltender in the tournament. In recognition of his pivotal role in the team's success, he was named the championship's best goaltender and MVP by the IIHF directorate, as well as to the Media All-Star Team. Following the historic result, the Latvian Saeima declared a public holiday. Šilovs later finished second in the voting for the inaugural IIHF Male Player of the Year award, behind Connor Bedard. Šilovs started playing ice hockey in 2004 in his hometown of Ventspils. "Arturs Silovs at eliteprospects.com". Eliteprospects. Retrieved February 16, 2023.
