This article outlines notable events occurring in 2001 in spaceflight, including major launches and EVAs. The Russian space station Mir ended its mission on 23 March 2001, when it was brought out of its orbit, entered the atmosphere and was destroyed. Major components ranged from about 5 to 15 years in age, and included the Mir Core Module, Kvant-1, Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr, Priroda, and Docking Module. Although Russia was optimistic about Mir's future, the country's commitments to the International Space Station programme left no funding to support Mir. For the purposes of this section, the yearly tally of orbital launches by country assigns each flight to the country of origin of the rocket, not to the launch services provider or the spaceport. 5 10 15 20 Ariane Atlas Delta R-7 R-36 Space Shuttle Titan UR Zenit Others   Ariane 4   Ariane 5   Atlas II   Delta II   Molniya-M   Soyuz-U   Soyuz-FG   Tsyklon-2   Tsyklon-3   Space Shuttle   Titan IV   Proton-K   Proton-M   Zenit-2   Zenit-3   Others   5 10 15 20 25 30 China France India International waters Japan Kazakhstan Russia United States   Jiuquan   Kourou   Satish Dhawan   Ocean Odyssey   Tanegashima   Baikonur   Plesetsk   Svobodny   Cape Canaveral   Kennedy   Kodiak   Vandenberg 5 10 15 20 25 30 Low Earth Medium Earth / Molniya Geosynchronous / transfer Heliocentric / Planetary transfer   Low Earth   Low Earth (Mir)   Low Earth (ISS)   Low Earth (SSO)   Medium Earth   Molniya   Geosynchronous   Heliocentric Bergin, Chris.
