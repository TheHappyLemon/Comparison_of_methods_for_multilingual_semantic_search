Lars Ytting Bak (born 16 January 1980) is a Danish former professional road bicycle racer, who rode professionally between 2002 and 2019 for the Fakta, BankGiroLoterij, Team Saxo Bank, HTC–Highroad, Lotto–Soudal and Team Dimension Data squads. Since retiring as a rider, Bak has acted as a directeur sportif for NTT Pro Cycling in 2020, and as team manager for UCI Women's WorldTeam Uno-X Pro Cycling Team in 2022. Born in Silkeborg, Bak became a professional in 2002 for Team Fakta where he rode with fellow Dane Allan Johansen. In 2004 they both switched to BankGiroLoterij where Lars Bak would gain his first professional win, but as the BankGiroLoterij team stopped after the 2004 season, both Bak and Johansen went to Team CSC in 2005. Here, Bak won the Danish National Road Race Championships, and in the later half of the season he showed his strength and talent as a good upcoming rider, as he won the respected ten stage Under 25 race, the Tour de l'Avenir. He won the leader's jersey by sprinting to the win in a group of four riders on the first stage, a position he defended through the following nine stages bar one, including a time trial and a number of hilly stages. In 2011 he finally made his Tour de France debut where he worked hard for Mark Cavendish's sprint train and finished off by taking part in a breakaway on the last stage. Bak joined Lotto–Belisol for the 2012 season. In 2012, he won stage 12 of the Giro d'Italia. Bak retired at the end of the 2019 season after 18 years as a professional.
