Senec (Hungarian: Szenc, German: Wartberg) is a town in the Bratislava Region of south-western Slovakia. The town is the administrative seat of the Senec District and its largest municipality. In 2022 it had a population of over 20,000. The town is a summer tourism and recreation center well known for its summer resort Sunny Lakes (Slovak: Slnečné jazerá) and its proximity to Bratislava, the capital and largest city of Slovakia. The town's contemporary name comes from a Slavic appellative seno, meaning hay, as the inhabitants dealt with cattle trade (see also Senica, Senné, Veľký Krtíš District or Senné, Michalovce District). Throughout its history the town name's form changed multiple times, in 1252 being written as Zemch, in 1451 as Sencz. In German, the name Wartberg was historically used. The name is supposedly derived from a fortified hill upon which the Church of Saint Nicholaus stands to this day. In the 9th century, the territory of Senec became part of the Great Moravia. In the second half of the 15th century, Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus gave Senec privileges and it got the right of organizing a fair around 1480. In the 19th century, it started to develop after the Pressburg - Budapest railway which runs through the town had been built. After the Austro-Hungarian army disintegrated in November 1918, Czechoslovak troops occupied the area, later acknowledged internationally by the Treaty of Trianon. Between 1938 and 1945 Senec once more became part of Miklós Horthy's Hungary through the First Vienna Award. In 1945, it was recovered by Czechoslovakia. A number of residents were affected by the Beneš Decrees and 630 citizens who collaborated with Miklós Horthy's forces during occupation of Senec were forced to leave the town in 1947 to Hungary. This was a part of Czechoslovak-Hungarian post-war treaty regarding exchange of citizens signed by both, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. From 1945 until the Velvet Divorce, it was part of Czechoslovakia. Since then it has been part of Slovakia. The historic Church of Saint Nicholaus is located in the southwestern part of the town.
