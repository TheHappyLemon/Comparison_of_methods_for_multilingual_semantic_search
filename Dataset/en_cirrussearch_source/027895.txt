Staré Město (Czech pronunciation: [ˈstarɛː ˈmɲɛsto]; in 1950–1996 Staré Město u Uherského Hradiště) is a town in Uherské Hradiště District in the Zlín Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 6,600 inhabitants. The name means literally "old town". Staré Město, located about 22 km (14 mi) southwest of Zlín, creates a conurbation with Uherské Hradiště. It is located mostly in a flat agricultural landscape of the Lower Morava Valley, but a small western part of the municipal territory extends into the Kyjov Hills. Staré Město lies on the right bank of the Morava River, which forms the town's border with Uherské Hradiště. The Baťa Canal flows through the eastern part of the town. In the 9th century, the area of Staré Město was part of Velingrad, one of two capital cities of the Great Moravian Empire. After the fall of Great Moravia, Velingrad lost its importance and became a village with two churches. The first written mention of Velingrad is from 1141. In 1205, the Cistercian monks founded nearby a monastery and named it Velehrad. The market village of Velingrad became their property. The Great Moravian rotunda was rebuilt to the parish Church of Saint Michael the Archangel in 1250. In 1321, Velingrad was renamed Staré Město. In 1841, the railway was built. From 1971 to 1990, Staré Město was part of Uherské Hradiště. From 1990, it has been a separate municipality. Staré Město was hit by the 1997 Central European flood. In the same year, the municipality was promoted to a town. Staré Město is known for the Great Moravia Monument. It was built above the foundations of the first discovered Great Moravian building in Czech territory, which was the church "Na Valách". Great Moravia Monument is a museum with expositions dedicated to the Great Moravian Empire and life in the 9th century. The Church of Saint Michael the Archangel dates from the firs thalf of the 13th century. Its core contains remnants of a Great Moravian rotunda. The Church of the Holy Spirit is a modern church from 2002. Kovozoo is a unique "zoo" with animals and other exhibits created from metal. It is an entertainment complex that also serves for environmental education.
