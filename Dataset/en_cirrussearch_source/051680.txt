Amderma (Russian: Амдерма, lit. a walrus rookery in Nenets) is a rural locality (a settlement) in Zapolyarny District of Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russia, located on the coast of Kara Sea, near the Vaygach Island, 490 kilometers (300 mi) from Naryan-Mar, the administrative center of the autonomous okrug. Population: 541 (2010 Census); 647 (2002 Census). It was established in 1933.[citation needed] Previously an urban-type settlement, it was demoted to a rural locality in November 2005, but its rural status was not officially codified until a law to that effect was passed in April 2015.[citation needed] Amderma has a polar climate (ET) with very cool and short summers combined with very long and cold (but by Russian standards not severe) winters. Although relative winter temperatures are normally hovering around −20 °C (−4 °F), the transition months of May and October see a milder form of winter. As a result of the lack of regular warm temperatures Amderma is above the tree line. It experiences midnight sun and polar night. However, the cold Arctic Ocean tempers and reduces the heat effect midnight sun brings to inland locations further south such as Naryan-Mar. Brief warm temperatures have been recorded when southerly winds have reached the area with a July record high of 31.8 °C (89.2 °F). Winters are very cold for a marine location, but in spite of this there are several marine localities at lower parallels in North America that experience colder January lows than Amderma. Fluorite deposits are located in the vicinity of Amderma, but the mines have been abandoned since the 1990s. It is home to the Amderma Airport, a civil airport and military base.
