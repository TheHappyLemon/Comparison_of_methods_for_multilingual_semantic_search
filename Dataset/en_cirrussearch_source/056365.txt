The Museum of Fine Arts (Dutch: Museum voor Schone Kunsten, MSK) an art museum in Ghent, Belgium, is situated at the East side of the Citadelpark (near the Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst). The museum's collection consists of some 9000 artworks, dating from the Middle Ages to the 20th century. Over 600 works can be found on display permanently, with the collection largely focusing on Flemish Art (Southern Netherlands). It also houses several European—especially French—paintings, in addition to a large amount of sculptures. Next to its permanent collection the museum organises temporary exhibitions. Between March 2011 and January 2021, the museum conducted 41 exhibitions. The building was designed by city architect Charles van Rysselberghe around 1900. In 2007 the museum reopened after four years of restoration. The museum is a member of The Flemish Art Collection. This is a structural partnership joining the three main museums of fine arts in Flanders: Royal Museum of Fine Arts, the Groeninge Museum in Bruges and the Ghent Museum of Fine Arts. The museums’ collections have all been developed in a similar way and complement each other perfectly. Together, they offer a unique, representative overview of Flemish art from the 15th to the 20th century. As partners sharing the same responsibility in Belgian cultural heritage, the three museums exchange their expertise, they strive for a more sustainable, high quality management and international awareness of their collections, including works that are part of the world patrimony.
