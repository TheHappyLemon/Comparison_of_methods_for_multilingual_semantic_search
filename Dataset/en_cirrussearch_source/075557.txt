Resen (Macedonian: Ресен [ˈrɛːsɛn] ) is a town in southwestern North Macedonia, with just under 9,000 inhabitants. Resen is approximately equidistant between Bitola and Ohrid. The town rises 880 metres (2,887 feet) above sea level and is situated near Lake Prespa. Resen is the only town in the Prespa Lake area and is the seat of Resen Municipality. The name of the city in Macedonian is Resen (Ресен) and in Turkish Resne, while in Albanian it is known as Resnjë (definite form: Resnja). In Aromanian, it is Areshanj and in Greek Resinion, Ρησίνιον. The ancient Illyrian city of Damastion (Δαμάστιον in Greek) may be near Resen. Resen's history dates back to Roman times when the famous road Via Egnatia was built, passing through the city. During the Middle Ages, the Prespa area was part of the Macedonian Slavic kingdom under Samuil. After the Battle of Klyuch, some of Samuil's soldiers, who were each blinded in one eye, settled in a village on the shore of Lake Prespa. The Byzantines called the village Asamati. The Byzantine meaning of this word is "settlement of one-eyed people". From then on, Resen was under Byzantine rule. Later, Resen became part of the Second Bulgarian Empire, Serbian Empire and Ottoman Empire, and it was the birthplace of Ahmed Niyazi Bey, an Albanian officer from a noble family of the town, who was one of the initiators and leaders of the Young Turk Revolution in the region in 1908. Ahmed Niyazi Bey's most famous monument in Resen is the Saraj, a French-style estate he built. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Resen was part of the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. During this time, Aromanians were the second most numerous group in Resen after Macedonians. From 1929 to 1941, Resen was part of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
