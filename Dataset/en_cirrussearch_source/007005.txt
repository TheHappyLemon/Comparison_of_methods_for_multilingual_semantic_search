.zm is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Zambia. Registrants of .zm domains must "have a presence in Zambia". Registrants are required to register domains at the third level under an existing second-level domain (SLD). There are eleven second-level domains: ac.zm: Academic institutions biz.zm: Businesses co.zm: Commercial entities com.zm: Commercial entities edu.zm: Academic institutions gov.zm: Government info.zm: "Information" mil.zm: Zambian military net.zm: Networks org.zm: Non-commercial organizations sch.zm: Schools The designations above are assumed based on observed practices and standard conventions, as ZICTA (the ccTLD registry) do not maintain online documentation codifying this. Most entities will generally register either a .co.zm or .org.zm domain, if they choose to use the ccTLD rather than a generic top-level domain. The one documented exception to the requirement to register at the third level is that "registered ISPs" may register at the second level—e.g., zamnet.zm. However, there are several undocumented variances to this rule—e.g., the Bank of Zambia's domain is boz.zm, and the regulator (ZICTA) operates under zicta.zm. ISPs are required to be registered with ZICTA, and only registered ISPs may be accredited as registrars. ZICTA lists ISPs on their website. "Bank of Zambia". Bank of Zambia.
