This was the first year for the "Raid" category which is a non-competitive class for motorcycles over 650cc. Both the participants and the organization make a commitment to take care not to leave harmful traces of their passage through countries. A series of projects will aim to use renewable resources to a long-term contribution to the lives of people in remote areas of several countries that the race will cross. These actions are tangible and lasting. The organization is leading the way, giving all participants reusable flatware kits for any event. Some organization vehicles are equipped with solar panels to use the energy stored during the day to carry out their missions. The organization of the Africa Eco Race also created two projects for power generation using photovoltaic panels in Mauritania to power a school in Nouakchott and a library in Chinguetti. For the environment, was created a category for experimental vehicles powered by renewable energy, designed to test at large scale and under extreme conditions, the reliability, power, strength and endurance of these vehicles. In 2011 Africa Eco Race funded the planting of 3000 eucalyptus in Nouakchott, Mauritania. However, the race organisation has refused to create any dialogue with the Polisario over rally access to Western Sahara.
