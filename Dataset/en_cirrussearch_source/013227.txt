"I Wanna", also known in its original version as "I Wonna"[citation needed], is a song recorded and composed by Latvian singer Marie N. It was the Latvian winning entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 2002, held in Tallinn, awarding the country its first victory in the contest. The song is particularly famous for Marie's performance. She began wearing a white suit and a trilby hat, which was removed by one of her dancers. As the song continued, other dancers removed her suit jacket and her dark shirt, revealing the top of a red dress. The suit trousers were then removed, revealing the bottom half of the short dress. On the final beat of the song, the hem was pulled, revealing the dress to be much longer. This visual performance was also supported by a salsa-style song, which made full use of the more up-beat tempos increasingly finding success in the contest.[citation needed] The song was performed twenty-third on the night, following Slovenia's Sestre with "Samo ljubezen" and preceding Lithuania's Aivaras with "Happy You". At the close of voting, it had received 176 points, placing 1st in a field of 24. It marked Latvia's first win in the contest. The song, however, was a commercial failure both in Latvia and Europe. The lyrics are relatively simple, with the singer telling her lover that she wants to control their relationship.[citation needed] "Final of Tallinn 2002". eurovision.tv.
