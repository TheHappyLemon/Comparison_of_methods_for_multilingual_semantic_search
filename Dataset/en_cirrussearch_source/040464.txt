If two teams are tied in points (for decide champions, for relegation or for UEFA competitions), there will be no tie-breakers will play a decider match. If three or more teams are tied in points (for decide champions, for relegation or for UEFA competitions), there will be check by Head-to-head points and the best two teams will play a decider match To determine the champion or qualification to UEFA competitions, a play-off is played to determine the winner. The two lowest placed teams are relegated into the Challenge League and the twelfth-placed team plays a play-off against the third-placed team from the First Division with the winner either keeping their place or get promoted to the top-tier league. Clubs finishing the season in the top positions of the Premier League are granted qualification to compete in one of UEFA's European competition. This is determined by Malta's position in the UEFA coefficients ranking system. The league winner qualifies to the first qualifying round for the UEFA Champions League. The second- and third-placed teams qualify for the first qualifying round for the UEFA Europa Conference League, respectively. An additional Europa Conference League place is taken through the country's domestic cup competition, the FA Trophy. If the winner of the FA Trophy qualifies for Europe through their league position, the fourth-placed team in the league qualifies for the UEFA Europa Conference League's first qualifying round. The Premier Division Standing Committee (PDSC) is a body composed of the Premier League club presidents who represent their club on a board. These do not have executive powers but are a formal body that has official influence with regards to rules, regulations and issues that relate to the league. From time to time the committee makes proposals to the respective and MFA bodies for approval. Valletta Hibernians Floriana Sliema Ħamrun Birkirkara Rabat Ajax St. George's F.C.
