Viestur Kairish (Latvian: Viesturs Kairišs; born 30 January 1971) is a Latvian opera, movie and theatre director. He has made a successful career in Latvia and Germany as an acclaimed director of operas. The movies and plays of Kairish have toured in many European festivals. After graduating the Latvian Academy of Culture as a theatre and film director in 1997, Kairish was appointed at the New Riga Theatre as a resident stage director. Since then he has set critically acclaimed plays both in Latvia and abroad. Several of his productions toured international festivals and venues, including the Wiener Festwochen (Hotel Europe), the Hebbel am Ufer (The Serpent), the Festival d’Avignon (Hotel Europe), and the Bonner Biennale (The Dark Deer, Hotel Europe). He debuted in opera directing with Peter Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin at the Latvian National Opera, receiving the Latvian Great Music Award for the Best Opera Production in 1999. Soon after, he staged Mozart's Die Zauberflöte at the Latvian National Opera in 2001 which later on was transformed into the short-movie artwork for the 42nd Venice Biennale. He joined Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen project at the Latvian National Opera with Die Walküre in 2007. He set the last three operas from the cycle which received positive reviews in respectable music and opera journals. The successful work on Wagner's operas opened for Kairish an international career in opera staging. He has been invited to Komische Oper Berlin, Oper Köln and Staatstheater Darmstadt. His debut in Germany, the production of Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream with Kristiina Poska conducting, was acknowledged by The Financial Times as a "worthy contribution to a fledgling Britten tradition for Germany" and received many other positive reviews. Work on Weber's Der Freischütz with Markus Stenz conducting at Oper Köln was acclaimed success as well both from the critics and public, same as the production of Verdi's Macbeth with Will Humburg conducting at Staatstheater Darmstadt. Currently, Kairish is working on Arturs Maskats' new opera Valentina together with Modestas Pitrenas as a conductor at the Latvian National Opera with scheduled shows at Deutsche Oper Berlin.
