The Belarusian Extraleague, abbreviated BHL, also known as the BETERA Extraleague for sponsorship reasons, or known as the Belarusian Open Championship, (Belarusian: Экстраліга, romanized: Ekstraliha), officially formed in 2006, is the top ice hockey league in Belarus. In its past, it has switched several times between being and not being an open league (in reference to allowing foreign teams), but for the 2008–2009 season, the Belarusian Ice Hockey Association decided to open the Belarusian Extraleague, the Belarusian Premier League and the Belarusian junior leagues. Before the season 2018-2019 the Belarusian Extraleague was divided in two leagues: Extraleague A with 8 teams and Extraleague B with 9 teams. For the 2021-2022 season, this division into Extraleague A and Extraleague B was canceled, with 12 teams taking part in the single championship. The Extraleague championships for the 2016-2017 season and 2017-2018 season were won by HC Neman Grodno The 2019/2020 Belarusian ice hockey championship was the only championship in the world that was not interrupted due to the coronavirus pandemic. Teams from the BHL can participate in the IIHF's annual Champions Hockey League (CHL), competing for the European Trophy. Participation is based on the strength of the various leagues in Europe (excluding the European/Asian Kontinental Hockey League). Going into the 2022–23 CHL season, the BHL was ranked the No. 7 league in Europe, allowing them to send their top team to compete in the CHL. 1992–93: Tivali Minsk 1993–94: Tivali Minsk 1994–95: Tivali Minsk 1995–96: Polimir Novopolotsk 1996–97: Polimir Novopolotsk 1997–98: Neman Grodno 1998–99: Neman Grodno 1999–2000: Tivali Minsk 2000–01: Neman Grodno 2001–02: Keramin Minsk 2002–03: HK Gomel 2003–04: Yunost Minsk 2004–05: Yunost Minsk 2005–06: Yunost Minsk 2006–07: Dinamo Minsk 2007–08: Keramin Minsk 2008–09: Yunost Minsk 2009–10: Yunost Minsk 2010–11: Yunost Minsk 2011–12: Metallurg Zhlobin 2012–13: Neman Grodno 2013–14: Neman Grodno 2014–15: HC Shakhtyor Soligorsk 2015–16: Yunost Minsk 2016–17: Neman Grodno 2017–18: Neman Grodno 2018–19: Yunost Minsk 2019–20: Yunost Minsk 2020–21: Yunost Minsk 2021–22: Metallurg Zhlobin 2022–23: Metallurg Zhlobin 2018–19: HK Lokomotiv Orsha 2019–20: HK Lokomotiv Orsha 2020–21: Khimik Novopolotsk "В Экстралиге в сезоне-2021/2022 сыграют 12 команд" (in Russian). belarushockey.com. 7 June 2021.
