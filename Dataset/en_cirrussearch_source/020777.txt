Camp Byers (Spanish: Campamento Byers) is a Spanish seasonal base camp on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. The locality is also designated for use as an International Field Camp. When necessary for scientific research purposes, temporary camping is allowed elsewhere on the protected peninsula under certain conditions. The area was visited by early 19th century sealers. The encampment is 1.2 km north-northwest of Nikopol Point, 1.04 km northeast of Sealer Hill, 3.13 km south by west of Chester Cone and 4.38 km west of Dometa Point (detailed Spanish mapping of the area in 1992, Bulgarian mapping in 2005 and 2009).
