Johann Benjamin Koppe (19 August 1750 in Danzig – 12 February 1791 in Hanover) was a German Lutheran theologian. He originated the "fragment hypothesis" (1783) in response to the Synoptic problem. He studied at the universities of Leipzig and Göttingen, where in 1775 he became a professor of theology. In 1784 he relocated to Gotha as a senior pastor, upper consistory and general superintendent, then in 1788 moved to Hanover as first court chaplain at the Schlosskirche, consistory and general superintendent for the Grafschaft Hoya.
