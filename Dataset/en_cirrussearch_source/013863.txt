Montpellier is one of the founding members of the first division of French football.[citation needed] Along with Marseille, Rennes and Nice, Montpellier is one of only a few clubs to have played in the inaugural 1932–33 season and is still playing in the first division.[citation needed] The club won Ligue 1 for the first time in the 2011–12 season.
