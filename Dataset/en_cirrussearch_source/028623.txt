After her introduction to the American porn industry she became the October 1998 Penthouse Pet of the Month (U.S. edition). Saint's early films were shot in Europe, many for Private Media Group. She performed in a Private Media Group sex in space-themed pornographic film The Uranus Experiment: Part Two, which featured a brief scene filmed in a Russian aircraft flying a parabolic track (similar to NASA's Vomit Comet). The film featured around 20 seconds of Saint and Nick Lang (who both portray astronauts living on a space station) having penetrative sex in freefall. The scene was nominated for a Nebula Award, but it did not win. Saint was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at Torino Sex 2005, Turin's second annual Delta of Venus Fair.
