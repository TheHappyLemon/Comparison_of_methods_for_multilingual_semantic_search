The Cecil B. DeMille Award is an honorary Golden Globe Award bestowed by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) for "outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment". The HFPA board of directors selects the honorees from a variety of actors, directors, writers and producers who have made a significant mark in the film industry. It was first presented at the 9th Golden Globe Awards ceremony in February 1952 and is named in honor of its first recipient, director Cecil B. DeMille. The HFPA chose DeMille due to his prestige in the industry and his "internationally recognized and respected name". DeMille received the award the year his penultimate film, The Greatest Show on Earth, premiered. A year later in 1953, the award was presented to producer Walt Disney. The award has been presented annually since 1952, with exceptions being 1976, 2008, 2022, and 2024. The second incident was due to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike's cancellation of that year's ceremony. The award that year was meant to honor director Steven Spielberg, but due to the cancellation of the ceremony, the award was presented to him the following year. The third occurrence resulted from various media companies, actors, and other creatives boycotting the awards in protest over its lack of action to increase the membership diversity of the HFPA. In 2024, the award was shelved to make way for additional categories at that year's ceremony. The youngest honoree was actress Judy Garland, at age 39 in 1962. Garland was also the first female honoree. The oldest honoree was producer Samuel Goldwyn, at age 93 in 1973. In 1982, Sidney Poitier became the first African-American recipient. In 2018, Oprah Winfrey became the first African-American woman to receive the honor. As of 2023[update], 69 honorees have received the Cecil B. DeMille Award: 16 women and 53 men. The award has notably been presented to two members of the same family: with Jane Fonda receiving the award in 2018, 38 years after it was presented to her father Henry. Stanley Kramer and Adolph Zukor received nominations for the award. Stanley Kramer received a nomination for the award. The 2008 awards ceremony was cancelled due to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike; the HFPA deferred the award to the 2009 ceremony. Woody Allen's award was accepted by Diane Keaton. The 2022 awards ceremony was cancelled due a boycott stemming from various media companies, actors, and other creatives over its lack of action to increase the membership diversity of the HFPA. Furthermore, broadcaster NBC announced in May 2021 that the network would refuse to broadcast the ceremony in support of the boycott. The 2024 award was shelved to make way for additional categories during the ceremony. It is expected to return in the future. Laws, Zach; Beachum, Chris (October 17, 2017).
