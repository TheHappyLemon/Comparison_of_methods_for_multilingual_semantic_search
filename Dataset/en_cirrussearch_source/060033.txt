The Gulf of Anadyr, or Anadyr Bay (Russian: Анадырский залив), is a large bay on the Bering Sea in far northeast Siberia. It has a total surface area of 200,000 km2 (77,000 sq mi) The bay is roughly rectangular and opens to the southeast. The corners are (clockwise from the south) Cape Navarin (another source says the adjacent Cape Thaddeus), Anadyr Estuary, Kresta Bay and Cape Chukotsky on the Chukchi Peninsula. It is about 250 mi (217 nmi; 402 km) across. A long gravel bar runs along the northeast shore for about 45 miles (39 nmi; 72 km) east from Kresta Bay. The Gulf of Anadyr is covered with ice normally 10 months a year. Whales such as bowhead and gray may appear close to shore. The town of Anadyr, the administrative centre of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, is located on the Anadyr Estuary. Provideniya, on Komsomolskaya Bay (formerly Emma Harbor; a branch of Provideniya Bay), and Egvekinot, on Kresta Bay, are the next largest coastal settlements. Vtoraya River Petit Fute (2006).
