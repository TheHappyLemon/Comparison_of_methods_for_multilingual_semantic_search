Ilya Proskuryakov (Russian: Илья Проскуряков; born February 21, 1987) is a Russian professional goaltender who is currently playing for Avangard Omsk in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Ilya Proskuryakov began his professional career in 2003, playing with Metallurg-2 Magnitogorsk of the Russian Hockey First League (Pervaya Liga). At just 18 years of age, Proskuryakov made his debut for parent team Metallurg Magnitogorsk of the Russian Superleague. Proskuryakov amassed less than 463 minutes within the Superleague over the next four years, but after Metallurg starter Andrei Mezin became injured in 2009, Proskuryakov rocketed up the charts as one of the brightest KHL rookies. In late January, 2009, Proskuryakov played one of his greatest games yet, earning a 2-0 win for his team, and stopping 26 saves for the shutout. Proskuryakov's night did not end there though as he became the first netminder to score a goal in a KHL game, when he added an empty net goal with 15 seconds left in the game. He saves, wins, and even scores, Martin Merk & Florian Russmann, IIHF.com, January 26, 2009. Retrieved June 2, 2009 "Top 10 players not in the NHL". bleacherreport.com. 2012-03-04.
