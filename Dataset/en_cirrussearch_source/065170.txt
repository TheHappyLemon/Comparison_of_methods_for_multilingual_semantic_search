Kuban State Technological University (Russian: Кубанский государственный технологический университет), also referred to as the Kuban State University of Technology, is a Russian public technical university located in Krasnodar, one of the first higher educational institutions established in the southern region of Russia. The first institution of higher education in the Kuban region, Kuban Polytechnic Institute (called North-Caucasian Polytechnic Institute in 1918-1919) was founded in Yekaterinodar on 16 June 1918. Professor Boris Lvovich Rosing, a physicist, the inventor of the electronic television, was one of the founders of the Institute. In 1923, Kuban Polytechnic Institute was formally abolished, but its staff and property were transferred to Kuban Agricultural Institute (formed in 1922 from the Faculty of Agronomy of the Polytechnic), where the development of higher technical education in Krasnodar was continued. Though it was a very difficult and unstable period in the history of Russia, the professors and lecturers made every effort to improve both the quality of education and research activities prompted by the needs of local food and beverage industries. This led to the development of two disciplines of food science such as fats-and-oil and wine-making technology. In 1938, after a series of preceding divisions and transformations the Agricultural Institute had been subjected to, the Chemical Technological Institute of Fat Industry and the Institute of Winemaking and Viticulture were established in Krasnodar. In 1943, these institutes were merged into the Krasnodar Institute of Food Technology. In 1963, the Krasnodar Institute of Food Technology was re-structured into Krasnodar Polytechnic Institute. On 11 April 1980, the institute was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. In November 1993, it obtained the status of a university, and as a result it was renamed Kuban State Technological University (KubSTU). On 6 November 2015, KubSTU was awarded the Prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the area of quality. Lobanov Vladimir (Лобанов Владимир Григорьевич), the rector of the Kuban State Technological University has signed a letter of support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
