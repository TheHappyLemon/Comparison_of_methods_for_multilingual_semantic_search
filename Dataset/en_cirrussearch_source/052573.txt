This timeline of United States government military operations, based in part on reports by the Congressional Research Service, shows the years and places in which U.S. military units participated in armed conflicts or occupation of foreign territories. Items in bold are wars most often considered to be major conflicts by historians and the general public. Note that instances where the U.S. government gave aid alone, with no military personnel involvement, are excluded, as are Central Intelligence Agency operations. In domestic peacetime disputes such as riots and labor issues, only operations undertaken by active duty personnel (aka "federal troops" or "U.S. military") are depicted in this article; state defense forces and the National Guard are not included, as they're not fully integrated into the U.S. armed forces even if they are federalized for duty within the U.S. Portions of this list are from the Congressional Research Service report RL30172, version of October 5, 2004. 1775–1783: American Revolutionary War: an armed struggle for secession from the British Empire by the Thirteen Colonies that would subsequently become the United States. 1776–1777: Cherokee War of 1776: a series of armed conflicts when the Cherokee fought to prevent the encroachment of American settlers into eastern Tennessee and eastern Kentucky; under British rule, this land had been preserved as native territory. 1776–1794: Cherokee–American wars: a continuation of the Second Cherokee War, which included a larger number of native tribes attempting to halt the expansion of settlers into Kentucky and Tennessee 1785–1795: Northwest Indian War: a series of battles with various native tribes in present-day Ohio. The goal of the campaign was to affirm American sovereignty over the region and to create increased opportunities for settlement. 1786–1787: Shays' Rebellion: a Western Massachusetts debtor's revolt over a credit squeeze that had financially devastated many farmers. The federal government was fiscally unable to raise an army to assist the state militia in combating the uprising; the weakness of the national government bolstered the arguments in favor of replacing the Articles of Confederation with an updated governmental framework. 1791–1794: Whiskey Rebellion: a series of protests against the institution of a federal tax on the distillation of spirits as a revenue source for repaying the nation's war bonds. The revolt was centered upon southwestern Pennsylvania, although violence occurred throughout the Trans-Appalachian region. 1798–1800: Quasi-War: an undeclared naval war with the French First Republic over American default on its war debt. Another contributing factor was the continuation of American trade with Britain, with whom their former French allies were at war. This contest included land actions, such as that in the Dominican Republic city of Puerto Plata, where U.S. Marines captured a French vessel under the guns of the forts. Congress authorized military action through a series of statutes. 1799–1800: Fries's Rebellion: a string of protests against the enactment of new real estate taxes to pay for the Quasi-War. Hostilities were concentrated in the communities of the Pennsylvania Dutch. 1801–1805: First Barbary War: a series of naval battles in the Mediterranean against the Kingdom of Tripoli, a quasi-independent state of the Ottoman Empire. Action was in response to the capture of numerous American ships by the infamous Barbary pirates. The federal government rejected the Tripolitan request for an annual tribute to guarantee safe passage, and an American naval blockade ensued. After the seizure of USS Philadelphia, American forces under William Eaton invaded coastal cities. A peace treaty resulted in the payment of a ransom for the return of captured American soldiers and only temporarily eased hostilities. 1806: Pike Expedition: On an exploratory expedition ordered by Gen. James Wilkinson, an Army platoon under Captain Zebulon Pike unintentionally entered Spanish Mexico at the headwaters of the Rio Grande. Pike and his troops were made prisoner without resistance at a fort he constructed in present-day Colorado, taken to Mexico, and later released after seizure of his papers. 1806–1810: Action in the Gulf of Mexico: American gunboats operated from New Orleans against Spanish and French privateers off the Mississippi Delta, chiefly under Captain John Shaw and Commodore David Porter. 1810: West Florida (Spanish territory): Governor William C. C. Claiborne of Louisiana, on orders of President James Madison, occupied with troops territory in dispute east of the Mississippi River as far as the Pearl River, later the eastern boundary of Louisiana. He was authorized to seize as far east as the Perdido River. 1812: Amelia Island and other parts of east Florida, then under Spain: Temporary possession was authorized by President James Madison and by Congress, to prevent occupation by any other power; but possession was obtained by General George Mathews in so irregular a manner that his measures were disavowed by the President. 1812–1815: War of 1812: On June 18, 1812, the United States declared war against the United Kingdom. Among the issues leading to the war were British impressment of American sailors into the Royal Navy, interception of neutral ships and blockades of the United States during British hostilities with France, and support for Indian attacks on American settlers in the Northwest Territory. The war ended with the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. 1813: West Florida (Spanish territory): On authority given by Congress, General Wilkinson seized Mobile Bay in April with 600 soldiers. A small Spanish garrison gave way. Thus U.S. troops advanced into disputed territory to the Perdido River, as projected in 1810. No fighting. 1813–1814: Nuku Hiva Campaign: U.S. forces built a fort on the island of Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands (now part of French Polynesia) to protect three prize ships which had been captured from the British. The American force subsequently fought with and against native tribes. 1814: Spanish Florida: General Andrew Jackson took Pensacola and drove out the British forces. 1814–1825: Caribbean: Engagements between pirates and U.S. Navy ships or squadrons took place repeatedly especially ashore and offshore about Cuba, Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo, and Yucatán.

In 1822, Commodore James Biddle employed a squadron of two frigates, four sloops of war, two brigs, four schooners, and two gunboats in the West Indies. 1815: Algiers: The Second Barbary War was declared against the United States by the Dey of Algiers of the Barbary states, an act not reciprocated by the United States. Congress did authorize a military expedition by statute. A large fleet under Captain Stephen Decatur attacked Algiers and obtained indemnities. 1815: Tripoli: After securing an agreement from Algiers, Captain Stephen Decatur demonstrated with his squadron at Tunis and Tripoli, where he secured indemnities for offenses during the War of 1812. 1816: Spanish Florida: United States forces destroyed Negro Fort, which harbored fugitive slaves making raids into United States territory. 1816–1818: Spanish Florida – First Seminole War: The Seminole Indians, whose area was a haven for escaped slaves and border ruffians, were attacked by troops under General Jackson and General Edmund P. Gaines and pursued into northern Florida. Spanish posts were attacked and occupied, British citizens executed. In 1819 the Floridas were ceded to the United States. 1817: Amelia Island (Spanish territory off Florida): Under orders of President James Monroe, United States forces landed and expelled a group of smugglers, adventurers, and freebooters. This episode in Florida's history became known as the Amelia Island Affair. 1818: Oregon: USS Ontario, dispatched from Washington, made a landing at the mouth of the Columbia River to assert U.S. claims.

American sympathizers sent supplies on SS Caroline, which was intercepted by the British and set ablaze, after killing one American. It was falsely reported that dozens of Americans were killed as they were trapped on board, and American forces retaliated by burning a British steamer while it was in U.S. waters. 1838–1839: Second Sumatran expedition: Sumatra, Indonesia – December 24 to January 4, a naval force landed to punish natives of the towns of Quallah Battoo and Muckie (Mukki) for depredations on American shipping. 1840: Fiji Islands: In July, naval forces landed to punish natives for attacking the U.S. Exploring Expedition. 1841: McKean Island (Drummond Island/Taputenea), Gilbert Islands (Kingsmill Group), Pacific Ocean: A naval party landed to avenge the murder of a seaman by the natives. 1841: Samoa: On February 24, a naval party landed and burned towns after the murder of an American seaman on Upolu. 1842: Mexico: Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones, in command of a squadron long cruising off California, occupied Monterey, California, on October 19, believing war had come.

After the annexation of Texas in 1845, the United States and Mexico failed to resolve a boundary dispute and President Polk said that it was necessary to deploy forces in Mexico to meet a threatened invasion. The war ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848. The treaty gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, established the U.S.–Mexican border of the Rio Grande, and ceded to the United States the present-day states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Wyoming, and parts of Colorado. In return, Mexico received US$18,250,000 (equivalent to about $643,000,000 in 2023) — less than half the amount the U.S. had attempted to offer Mexico for the land before the opening of hostilities. 1849: Smyrna (İzmir, Turkey): In July, a naval force gained release of an American seized by Austrian officials. 1851: Ottoman Empire: After a massacre of foreigners (including Americans) at Jaffa in January, a demonstration by the Mediterranean Squadron was ordered along the Turkish (Levantine) coast. 1851: Johanna Island (modern Anjouan, east of Africa): In August, forces from the sloop-of-war USS Dale exacted redress for the unlawful imprisonment of the captain of an American whaling brig. 1852–1853: Argentina: February 3 to 12, 1852; September 17, 1852, to April 1853: Marines were landed and maintained in Buenos Aires to protect American interests during a revolution. 1853: Nicaragua: March 11 to 13, U.S. forces landed to protect American lives and interests during political disturbances. 1853–1854: Japan: Commodore Matthew Perry and his expedition made a display of force leading to the "opening of Japan". 1853–1854: Ryukyu and Bonin Islands (Japan): Commodore Matthew Perry on three visits before going to Japan and while waiting for a reply from Japan made a naval demonstration, landing marines twice, and secured a coaling concession from the ruler of Naha on Okinawa; he also demonstrated in the Bonin Islands with the purpose of securing facilities for commerce. 1854: China: April 4 to June 17, American and British ships landed forces to protect American interests in and near Shanghai during Chinese civil strife. 1854: Mosquito Coast (Nicaragua): On July 9–15, naval forces bombarded and burned San Juan del Norte (Greytown) to avenge an injured during a riot to the American Minister to Nicaragua. 1855: China: On May 19–21, U.S. forces protected American interests in Shanghai and, from August 3 to 5 fought pirates near Hong Kong. 1855: Fiji Islands: From September 12 to November 4, an naval force landed to seek reparations for attacks on American residents and seamen. 1855: Uruguay: On November 25–29, United States and European naval forces landed to protect American interests during an attempted revolution in Montevideo. 1856: Panama State, Republic of New Granada: On September 19–22, U.S. forces landed to protect American interests during an insurrection. 1856: China: From October 22 to December 6, U.S. forces landed to protect American interests at Canton during hostilities between the British and the Chinese, and to avenge an assault upon an unarmed boat displaying the United States flag. 1857–1858: Utah War: The Utah War was a dispute between Mormon settlers in Utah Territory and the United States federal government.

In November and December of the same year United States vessels USS Saratoga, USS Wabash, and Fulton opposed another attempt of William Walker on Nicaragua.
