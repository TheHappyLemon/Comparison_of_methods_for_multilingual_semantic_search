The 2014–15 Premier League (known as the Barclays Premier League for sponsorship reasons) was the 23rd season of the Premier League, the top English professional league for association football clubs, since its establishment in 1992, and the 116th season of top-flight English football overall. The fixtures were announced on 18 June 2014. The season started on 16 August 2014 and concluded on 24 May 2015. Manchester City came into the season as defending champions of the 2013–14 season. Leicester City, Burnley and Queens Park Rangers entered as the three promoted teams. On 3 May 2015, Chelsea won the title with three games to spare after a 1–0 home win over Crystal Palace. It was their first league title since 2010, their fourth Premier League title and their fifth English league title overall. Holders Manchester City eventually finished second, after a short drop to fourth a few weeks before the final match. Burnley were the first team to be relegated despite beating Hull City 1–0, while Queens Park Rangers suffered the same fate after a 6–0 demolition by Manchester City the next day. Hull City were the third and final team to be relegated after Newcastle United beat West Ham United 2–0. They drew 0–0 against Manchester United on the final day of the season. Manchester City's Sergio Agüero won the Golden Boot with 26 goals, with his teammate Joe Hart clinching a record fourth Golden Glove, having kept 14 clean sheets. Eden Hazard and José Mourinho were named as Player and Manager of the Season respectively. Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Leicester City, Burnley and Queens Park Rangers, returning to the top flight after respective absences of ten years, four years and one year. They replaced Norwich City, Fulham and Cardiff City, who were relegated to the Championship after their respective top-flight spells of three years, thirteen years and one year.

(C) Champions; (R) Relegated Notes: Since winners of the 2014–15 FA Cup, Arsenal, and winners of the 2014–15 Football League Cup, Chelsea, qualified for the Champions League based on league position, the spot awarded to the FA Cup winners (Europa League group stage) was passed to the sixth-placed team, Liverpool, and the spot awarded to the League Cup winners (Europa League third qualifying round) was passed to the seventh-placed team, Southampton, since those teams were the first teams in the table not already qualified for any European competition. England was given an extra qualification berth for the Europa League first qualifying round as one of the top three associations in UEFA Respect Fair Play ranking. The spot was given to West Ham United after finishing on top of the Premier League Fair Play table. On 3 May 2015, Chelsea beat Crystal Palace 1–0 to secure the Premier League title with three games to play. PFA Player of the Year winner Eden Hazard scored the winning goal near the end of the first half, heading in the rebound of his own penalty kick. The win left Chelsea 16 points ahead of Arsenal, which had five games remaining. Chelsea were atop the standings the entire year, having got off to a good start. For Chelsea, it was the fourth title in the last eleven years, but first in the last six seasons. It was the fifth title in the club's 110-year history. "We showed absolutely everything since day one, everything football demands from a team," said manager José Mourinho. "We had fantastic attacking football, we had fantastic domination ... we defended amazingly well." It was Mourinho's 22nd career title. He won titles at Chelsea in 2005 and 2006, before being forced out by owner Roman Abramovich, and returning in 2013. Diego Costa led Chelsea with 20 goals.
