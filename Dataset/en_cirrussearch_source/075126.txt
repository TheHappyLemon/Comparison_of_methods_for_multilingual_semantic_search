He also crashed out in the second round of the 2012 US Open, after a defeat by No. 52 Martin Kližan. After a short break for recovery, Jo was back in France for the 2012 Moselle Open. Tsonga rolled to a semifinal berth with Russian Nikolay Davydenko. Tsonga had never beaten Davydenko in two previous attempts, but made sure that run was not extended to three with a tight three-set win. The final was an easy two-set win over Andreas Seppi, Tsonga's ninth ATP career title. At the 2012 China Open, Tsonga had a win and a walkover before beating Mikhail Youzhny in the quarterfinals. An easy win over Feliciano López advanced Tsonga to his third final of the year. No. 2 Novak Djokovic was his opponent. Djokovic pulled away in the second, taking the match in two sets. Tsonga continued his year with the 2012 Shanghai Masters. He had wins over Benoît Paire and Marcos Baghdatis, but he lost in the quarterfinals to Tomáš Berdych in straight sets. The busy schedule continued in Stockholm. Tsonga cruised past Go Soeda and Sergiy Stakhovsky in the opening rounds, and had Baghdatis retire against him after a close semifinal match. This set up a final against Tomáš Berdych – the second time in two weeks. Despite being a set and a break up, Tsonga lost in three sets. At the Valencia Open, Tsonga retired against Xavier Malisse. The Race To London was almost decided. Tsonga needed a quarterfinal appearance in Paris to secure it for certain. Tsonga came through an extremely tight encounter with Julien Benneteau and then beat Spaniard Nicolás Almagro; though Tsonga fell to David Ferrer in the quarterfinals, his win over Almagro secured his place in the ATP World Tour Finals.

Two more losses to Tomáš Berdych and Andy Murray ended his season. Rather than entering an ATP-recognised event, Tsonga opted for the 2013 Hopman Cup, where he was paired with Mathilde Johansson. France first faced Spain. Tsonga defeated Fernando Verdasco, but Johansson lost her singles, and the pair lost the doubles. Tsonga next played USA. Jo demolished John Isner, but in similar fashion, Johansson lost to Venus Williams, and the pair lost to the Americans in the mixed doubles. Lastly, France faced South Africa. Tsonga beat Kevin Anderson, before Johansson lost to Chanelle Scheepers, and the pair was forced to retire in the doubles with Tsonga injured.

Tsonga was then defeated in straight sets by David Ferrer. Following a run to the semifinals at Queen's, where Tsonga lost to the eventual champion, Andy Murray, Tsonga then competed at Wimbledon, where he was a two-time semifinalist. He retired in the second round against Ernests Gulbis. He missed the entire North American swing, including the US Open for the second time in four years, due to the injury. Tsonga then made a comeback at Metz, reaching the final but losing to compatriot Gilles Simon.

He played in the 2016 Madrid Open, where he was beaten in straight sets by Canadian Milos Raonic. He withdrew from the Italian Open with a muscle strain. Tsonga, the sixth seed, retired with an adductor muscle injury from his French Open third-round match against Latvia's Ernests Gulbis when he was leading 5–2 in the first set. This injury also forced Tsonga to pull out of the 2016 Aegon Championships. Tsonga took part in Wimbledon, where he lost in the quarterfinals to the second seed Andy Murray in five sets, after holding three set points in the first set and having a break point at the start of the final set.

Tsonga ended the season ranked No. 12. At the Australian Open, Tsonga defeated No. 23 seed Jack Sock and unseeded Dan Evans in the third and fourth rounds respectively, both in four sets. He then fell to No. 4-seeded Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals in straight sets, marking Tsonga's best result at the tournament since his 2013 quarterfinal run. In February, Tsonga won the Rotterdam singles title, beating David Goffin in the final in three sets to earn his first ATP World Tour singles title since the 2015 Moselle Open in Metz in September 2015. Seven days later, Tsonga won his 14th career (and his second of the year) ATP World Tour singles title by defeating Lucas Pouille in the singles final of the Open 13 to become the Open 13 singles champion for a record third time. Struggles with injury and the birth of Tsonga's first child had a significant impact on Tsonga's activity in the ensuing months. A first round loss to Fabio Fognini in Indian Wells, withdrawal from the Miami Masters, a second round loss in Monte Carlo to compatriot Adrian Mannarino, a second round withdrawal in Madrid and withdrawal from the Rome Masters were huge setbacks after an exciting start to the year. However, the end of May saw a return to winning ways for Tsonga as he cruised to a third ATP World Tour singles title of the season in Lyon. Wins over Carlos Berlocq, Karen Khachanov and Nikoloz Basilashvili set up a final against perennial foe Tomáš Berdych. A straight sets win saw Tsonga lift his first career ATP World Tour singles title on clay, as he improved to a 15–11 record in ATP World Tour finals. After struggling to string wins over the summer and the early autumn, Tsonga returned to the winner's circle in October, defeating Diego Schwartzman in straight sets to capture his fourth ATP World Tour singles title of the year at the European Open in Antwerp. In November, Tsonga along with Lucas Pouille, Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Richard Gasquet helped France to capture their 10th Davis Cup and first in 16 years. Tsonga won his first singles match against Steve Darcis but lost his second singles match against David Goffin in the Davis Cup final against Belgium; France won the tie with a score of 3–2. Tsonga played his first tournament of the year at the Australian Open, where he defeated the American qualifier Kevin King in straight sets in the first round. In the second round, Tsonga prevailed over the rising Canadian star Denis Shapovalov after being down 2–5 in the fifth set. In the third round, he faced Nick Kyrgios, who before the match referred to Tsonga as his 'idol'; Tsonga lost the match in four sets. Tsonga was called up to play for France in the 2018 Davis Cup World Group first-round tie against the Netherlands, but he withdrew one day before the start of the first singles match because of a knee injury. At the Open Sud de France, Tsonga held two match points when he was leading 6–1, 5–3 against Lucas Pouille in the semifinals before Tsonga was forced to retire from the match because of a left hamstring injury with the score at 6–1, 5–5. The Open Sud de France was Tsonga's second and last ATP World Tour tournament of the first four months of 2018. On 19 March, his ATP singles rankings fell to world no. 38, his lowest since he was ranked world no. 38 on 14 January 2008. Tsonga pulled out of five ATP World Tour tournaments that were to be held in February, March and April (Rotterdam, Marseille, Indian Wells, Miami and Monte-Carlo) due to injuries. He underwent left knee surgery on 3 April. Tsonga withdrew from the Masters 1000 tournaments in Madrid and Rome, the Lyon Open and the French Open because he had not recovered from his left knee surgery. On 28 May Tsonga was ranked outside the top 50 of the ATP singles rankings for the first time since 22 October 2007 when he was 22 years old. This was still due to his undergoing surgery earlier in the year on 3 April to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee that resulted in his not playing any tournaments for the next eight weeks. After missing three consecutive grand slam tournaments (French Open, Wimbledon and US Open) for the first time in his career, Tsonga finally made his return to competitive tennis at the ATP Tour 250 tournament in Metz held in September, where he lost his main draw first round match to Peter Gojowczyk. Tsonga won one and lost three singles matches in his next three events in Antwerp, Vienna and Paris. After the Paris Masters, he played just one more match, in the 2018 Davis Cup World Group final against Croatia; he lost the second singles rubber against Marin Čilić. Tsonga began the season with a semifinal appearance at the Brisbane Open where he lost to 4th seed Daniil Medvedev. Two weeks later at the Australian Open, he played world number 1 Novak Djokovic in the second round. He lost in straight sets. At the Open Sud de France, Tsonga won his first title since 2017 when he entered the tournament as a wildcard and defeated Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the final. He followed this up the next week with a quarterfinal appearance at the Rotterdam Open losing to 5th seed Daniil Medvedev. In the following week, he received a wildcard for the Open 13, where he fell again against a Russian youngster. This time it was against 21-year-old Andrey Rublev. Tsonga won the first set 6–2 but conceded the next two. A month later, having skipped Indian Wells, Tsonga entered the qualifying round of the Miami Open, where he beat Lukas Rosol before losing in straight sets to Pablo Cuevas. Tsonga started his clay season in Marrakech, playing the Grand Prix Hassan II. He beat Cedrik-Marcel Stebe, 3rd seed Kyle Edmund and qualifier Lorenzo Sonego without dropping a set before losing to countryman and eventual champion Benoit Paire in 3 sets in the semifinals. He was then awarded a wildcard entry to the Monte-Carlo Masters where he lost the 1st set and retired in the 2nd of his 1st round match against american prospect Taylor Fritz. Tsonga then returned to the ATP Challenger Tour for the first time since winning the Surbiton Trophy in June 2007. He entered the 48-player draw of the Bordeaux Open as a wildcard and the 3rd seed. With a bye in the 1st round, he defeated Viktor Troicki and qualifier Hugo Nys in straight sets before losing in the quarterfinals against Filip Horansky by double 6–4. After this performance, he returned to the top 100 for the 1st time since the previous October. Next, Tsonga entered the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Rome losing in the 1st round to Monte-Carlo champion and 12th seed Fabio Fognini in straight sets. In the following week, he entered the ATP 250 Lyon Open where he reached the quarterfinals by beating 5th seed Dušan Lajović in the 1st round and Canadian qualifier Steven Diez in a match in which Tsonga lost the 1st set, won the second in a tiebreak and won the third to conclude the match just short of 3 hours. He ultimately lost to 1st seed Nikoloz Basilashvili in a double 6–4 match. He returned to the French Open with a 1st round win in 4 sets against Peter Gojowczyk. Since Tsonga wasn't seeded due to his ranking of 82nd in the world, he drew 7th seed Japanese Kei Nishikori in the 2nd round and, although the Frenchman won the 1st set, he fell short in the following 3 and exited the tournament. Tsonga began his grass-court season the week following the French Open in Sttutgart, where he comfortably beat Mischa Zverev 6–3 and 6–0 in the first round before losing to Milos Raonic in the 2nd round in a tightly contested 3-setter with two tiebreaks. He then played the ATP 500 Halle Open, where he beat Benoît Paire in two tight sets, before facing his rival and at that time 9-time champion of the tournament Roger Federer in the 2nd round. Despite the heavy favoritism of the Swiss, Tsonga had a great performance, forcing a tiebreak, in the 1st set, that he lost by 7–5, winning the 2nd set 6–4 and only succumbing by 7–5 in the 3rd. Federer went on to win his record 10th title in Halle.

Tsonga's last event of the year was the Paris Masters in October. As a wildcard, he made it to the quarterfinals defeating world number 9 Matteo Berrettini along the way. He played Rafael Nadal and lost in straight sets. At the end of 2019, Tsonga's ranking had jumped from 239 at the beginning of the year to 29 at the end. Tsonga played only two matches in 2020. The first one came at the Qatar Open where he went in as the 3rd seed and lost to Miomir Kecmanović in the first round. The second one came at the Australian Open where he went in as the 28th seed and lost to Alexei Popyrin in the first round. After the COVID-19 pandemic had shut down tennis in March, Tsonga decided to remain inactive for the rest of 2020, even when tennis came back in August. Tsonga returned to the tour at the Open Sud de France where he lost in the first round to Sebastian Korda in straight sets. He recorded his first win of the year at the Open 13 where he defeated Feliciano López in straight sets but lost in the next round to 4th seed Ugo Humbert in straight sets. At the Dubai Open, Tsonga sustained an arm injury in his first round match against Malek Jaziri and retired after just six games. The injury would affect his results for the rest of the year.

On 6 April 2022, Tsonga announced that he would retire at the 2022 French Open. He played his last match on 24 May against Casper Ruud in the first round, in which he lost in four sets. Tsonga's most famous rivalry is perhaps against Novak Djokovic. They have met 23 times with Djokovic leading 17–6, including 7–1 in the majors. Their first meeting was in the final of the 2008 Australian; Djokovic and Tsonga had defeated the top two players, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in their respective semifinals in straight sets. Djokovic won the final in four sets to claim his first major title. Tsonga then won their next four meetings, before Djokovic stopped the streak at Miami in 2009. Their next meeting at a Grand Slam was again at the Australian Open, in the 2010 quarterfinals, exactly two years to the day since Djokovic defeated him to win his first Grand Slam singles title. However, this time it was Tsonga who prevailed, winning in five sets after Djokovic fell ill during the match. It was not until another year and a half until they met again, with the stakes even higher, in the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2011, with the winner advancing to his first Wimbledon final. It was their first meeting on grass, and Djokovic prevailed in four sets to advance to his first Wimbledon final, and in the process ending the seven-and-a-half-year reign of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at the top of the rankings. At the 2012 French Open, Tsonga and Djokovic met again in an important match, in the quarterfinals. After losing the first set, he rallied to take the next two sets and held two match points on Djokovic's serve in the fourth set before the Serb fought back to force a tie-break. Despite Tsonga's saving set points in the breaker, Djokovic took one at the third opportunity. This forced a deciding set, which Tsonga lost after more than four hours of play. They met again two months later at the Olympics, with Tsonga losing in straight sets in the quarterfinals. They met in the final of the 2012 China Open, with Tsonga again losing in straight sets. The pair were drawn in the same pool for the 2012 ATP World Tour Finals. Tsonga lost his first (of three) round-robin matches to Djokovic. It was his fifth loss to Djokovic in 2012. They then met in the third round of the 2014 Rogers Cup, with Tsonga scoring his first win over Djokovic since the 2010 Australian Open with a straight-set victory. Prior to this victory, he had lost his last nine matches and 18 sets to Djokovic. They met again in the quarterfinals of the 2016 US Open, where Tsonga lost on a retirement after losing the first two sets. After two-and-a-half-years they met again in the second round of the 2019 Australian Open, where Djokovic won in straight sets. Tsonga and Roger Federer have played 18 times, with Federer leading 12–6. They have met six times in Grand Slam tournaments with Federer leading 4–2; including their five-set matches in the quarterfinals of 2011 Wimbledon and 2013 Australian Open. Tsonga's victory at 2011 Wimbledon saw him become the first man in Grand Slam history to defeat Federer after dropping the first two sets. They have also one Grand Slam semifinal meeting in the 2010 Australian Open, with Federer winning in straight sets. They have played in the 2011 ATP World Tour Finals final with Federer winning in three-sets. The pair have also met in two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 finals. The first was in the 2011 BNP Paribas Masters, with Federer winning his first title in Bercy, and the second was in the 2014 Rogers Cup, with Tsonga winning his second Masters 1000 title. Their most recent meeting came at the 2019 Halle Open, with Federer defeating Tsonga in 3 tight sets. There are a number of achievements that Tsonga has attained over the Big Four of tennis. Tsonga, Tomáš Berdych and Stan Wawrinka are the only people to have beaten all four members of the Big Four at least once at a major. Tsonga and David Nalbandian are the only two players (other than members of the Big Four) to have beaten three members of it at a single tournament. (Tsonga defeated Djokovic in the round of 16, Murray in the quarterfinals, and Federer in the final to win the 2014 Canada Masters). Tsonga is one of seven players to win a tournament in which all members of the Big Four played (2008 Paris Masters). Tsonga, Andy Murray and Juan Martín del Potro are the only players to defeat Federer, Nadal and Djokovic at least once while they held the world No. 1 ranking. Tsonga was known for his offensive baseline style of play but was also able to mix his style of play up by rushing to the net. His movement around the court was considered to be very good, considering his height. Tsonga is also known for his ability to serve well under pressure, having saved 67% of the break points he faced in his career. His two weaknesses were his return of serve and to a lesser extent his backhand. Tsonga's serve is one of his fastest, strongest and most dominant shots, mixing both slice and speed, enabling him to create and win easier points, such as an ace or a one-two-punch. Because of the action of his serve, which is dramatically abbreviated, he does very well to create as much power as he does, with speeds of up to 237 km/h (147 mph). Tsonga has achieved his best results on hard courts, most notably on the former Plexicushion Prestige surface at the Australian Open, where he made the final in 2008, the semifinals in 2010, and the quarterfinals in 2009, 2013, and 2017. In his career on the ATP circuit, the majority of his final appearances have come on hard courts. On grass, he reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2011 and 2012 and the quarterfinals in 2010 and 2016; he also reached the final of the Queen's Club Championships in 2011. In general, Tsonga has struggled on clay, although his clay-court skills are improving, as evidenced by his 2012 season, where he reached the quarterfinals at the French Open, Monte-Carlo, and Rome. In 2013, he reached the two first clay court semifinals of his career, first at the 2013 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, where he lost to Rafael Nadal, and at the 2013 French Open, where he lost to David Ferrer after beating No. 3 Roger Federer in the quarterfinals. He won his first clay-court tournament at the 2017 Lyon Open. Tsonga is known for his aggressive groundstrokes. His forehand and backhand are both effective in setting up points. His powerful, heavy and accurate forehand is his most consistent shot, especially when delivered down the line. Although his backhand is generally not as strong as his forehand during the rallies, he is very capable of hitting attacking shots on his backhand wing. His net play is skillful, especially on attack. He can play both two-handed and one-handed backhand. He added the one-handed backhand to his repertoire midway through 2011, as was evident in his matches against Andy Murray in the final of Queen's Club and against Federer in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon. Although rarely used as a groundstroke in a neutral rally, it is particularly effective as a passing shot down the line or cross-court. During the off-season in 2009, Tsonga switched rackets from Wilson to Babolat. He was using Babolat AeroPro Drive+ racket, but in July 2018, changed to the Babolat Pure Strike. His strings are LUXiLON Alu Power Rough strings. He is sponsored by Adidas for his attire.
