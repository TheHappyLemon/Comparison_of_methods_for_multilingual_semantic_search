Unione Sportiva Livorno 1915 (formerly A.S. Livorno Calcio, commonly known as Livorno), is a semi-professional Italian football club based in Livorno, Tuscany. They compete in Serie D, the top tier of semi-professional Italian football after their promotion from the regional Eccellenza Tuscany league. The team's colours are dark red (amaranto in Italian, from which the team's nickname is derived). Livorno was one of the original sides of Serie A, the top flight of Italian football, but have been relegated seven times from the top flight and have undergone two club refoundings in 1991 and 2021, necessitating a rise from the regional Eccellenza leagues. Their longest spells in the top division were from 1940 to 1949 (accounting for seven seasons) and from 2004 to 2008. The amaranto have won Serie B in two occasions, the Lega Pro Prima Divisione and Lega Pro Seconda Divisione once each, and the Supercoppa di Serie C once as well. Livorno play their home matches at the Stadio Armando Picchi. Founded on 15 February 1915, the club ended the Italian Football Championship 1919–20 in second place, losing the final to Internazionale.[citation needed] One year later, they were defeated in the semi-final by arch-rivals Pisa.[citation needed] In 1933, the club moved to the current stadium, originally named after Edda Ciano Mussolini, daughter of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.[citation needed] Livorno was one of the original Serie A teams.[citation needed] They played at top level during periods of 1929–31, 1933–35 and 1937–39.[citation needed] Successively, Livorno ended as Serie A runners-up in the 1942–43 season.[citation needed] Livorno left Serie A in 1949 after seven consecutive seasons.[citation needed] They were relegated to Serie C soon after (1951–52 season), making a return to Serie B in 1955 for a single season and again from 1964 to 1972.[citation needed] They were relegated to Serie C2 in 1982–83 and played again in the third level between 1984 and 1989.[citation needed] The club was then canceled in 1991, being forced to start from Eccellenza; two consecutive promotions led the team back to Serie C2.[citation needed] The club was promoted to Serie C1 in 1997 and was acquired by Aldo Spinelli two years later.[citation needed] Under the new property, Livorno returned to Serie B in 2001.[citation needed] Livorno was promoted to Serie A after finishing third in the Serie B 2003–04, one of six clubs to be promoted that season.[citation needed] It had been 55 years since Livorno's last season in the top flight, and as a result of this, most[who?][vague] were predicting an instant return to Serie B for the club.[citation needed] The first match in the major league was attended by Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, a Livorno citizen and team supporter in his childhood.[citation needed] There were spells of struggle[clarification needed] during the season, but there were many[vague][quantify] more good performances shown, and Livorno finished a surprise[tone] and creditable[tone] ninth place in the league for the Serie A 2004–05, also thanks to goals by striker Cristiano Lucarelli, who won the Serie A top scorer award that season, outscoring[tone] Andriy Shevchenko and Adriano.[citation needed] The Serie A 2005–06 saw Livorno in sixth place after the first half of the season the team, being involved for qualification to the next UEFA Cup.[citation needed] Shortly after, Roberto Donadoni announced his resignation after having been criticized by the club's chairman Aldo Spinelli.[citation needed] Donadoni was replaced by veteran coach Carlo Mazzone, who was only able to save a UEFA Cup place due to the expulsion of three teams from Europe in the Calciopoli scandal.[citation needed] Mazzone then saw his team suffer a run of seven straight defeats.[citation needed] In May 2006, Daniele Arrigoni was appointed the new coach for the next season.[citation needed] In the Serie A 2006–07 season, Livorno took part in the UEFA Cup for the first time. The Tuscan side was drawn to face the Austrian team SV Pasching in the first round, beating them[tone] 3–0 on aggregate. They thus qualified for the group stages being drawn in Group A, along with Rangers, Auxerre, FK Partizan, and Maccabi Haifa. After a home loss to Rangers (2–3) and two 1–1 draws against Partizan in Belgrade (where goalkeeper Marco Amelia scored in the 87th minute) and Maccabi (in Livorno), the Tuscan side gained a 1–0 victory over Auxerre in the last game played in France, thus earning a spot in the Round of 32 of the competition. However, the Spanish team Espanyol knocked out Livorno from the UEFA Cup by winning 4–1 on aggregate. After day 19 of the Italian Serie A, Arrigoni was sacked by chairman Spinelli, but his position was kept due to the strong opposition by the team.[citation needed] His dismissal was, however, only delayed, as Arrigoni was eventually fired on 21 March 2007, and replaced by Fernando Orsi, who managed to[tone] keep the team away from the relegation battle.[citation needed] For the 2007–08 campaign, Orsi was confirmed as head coach and a number of[quantify] notable signings[why?][vague][clarification needed] such as Francesco Tavano, Diego Tristan and Vikash Dhorasoo were finalised, but also the transfer of Lucarelli to Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk.[citation needed] The club, however, did not start well, making[clarification needed] a mere[tone] two points in the first seven matches, and Orsi was sacked on 9 October and replaced by Giancarlo Camolese.[citation needed] Despite showing some[quantify] positive signals[tone] at the beginning, Livorno found himself[tone][clarification needed] again at the bottom of league table.[citation needed] On 28 April 2008, Camolese was fired as Orsi was re-appointed, but in the penultimate day of the season, the team could not avoid relegation, due to a 1–0 home defeat against Torino.[citation needed] They finished last in the Serie A standings of the 2007–08 season.[citation needed] Thus, being relegated to Serie B.[citation needed] They finished Serie B as the third place team in 2008–09 season and returned to Serie A after winning promotion play-offs after defeating successively Grosseto with a 4–3 aggregate score and Brescia with a 5–2 aggregate score.[citation needed] However, this return was short-lived and one season later they relegated again to Serie B after finishing last.[citation needed] Livorno were promoted again after they beat Empoli 2–1 on aggregate to get the Serie A promotion. In the 2019–20 season of Serie B, Livorno ended up last, leading them to be relegated to Serie C.[citation needed] In the 2020–21 Serie C season, Livorno finished in last place with 29 points following a five-point deduction due to failure to pay player wages on time, and was relegated to Serie D.[citation needed] However, due to the club's bankruptcy, they could not pay the admission fee for Serie D and disbanded.[citation needed] The club joined the Eccellenza Toscana for the 2021-22 season under the new denomination of Unione Sportiva Livorno 1915 and the ownership of former Prato chairman Paolo Toccafondi. In the 2021-22 season, Livorno finished first in Group B of the Eccellenza Toscana, but were narrowly defeated in the national playoffs by S.S.D. Pomezia Calcio.[citation needed] However, Livorno were later admitted back to Serie D in place of Figline, who were barred from promotion after throwing a game against Tau Calcio Altopascio which influenced the promotion tournament seeding. In their first Serie D season, Livorno finished 5th of 18 teams in Group E, winning a head-to-head tie with Flaminia, which qualified them for the promotion playoffs where they lost to eventual Group E playoff winners US Pianese 3-1.

No Serie A club's supporters wear their political allegiance more boldly than Livorno's, whose leanings are strongly to the left, the city of Livorno being the birthplace of Italy's Communist party.  The National Livorno's supporters are well known for their left-wing politics which often spark fiercely violent clashes with opposing right-wing supporter groups, especially those of Lazio and Verona.[citation needed] Former Lazio striker Paolo Di Canio once made a Roman salute to his own fans during a match against Livorno, when tensions were running high between the two clubs' ultra groups. Since 2005, a group of migrant Livorno supporters resident in northern Europe have styled themselves Partigiani Livornesi Scandinavia (transl. Livornian partisans of Scandinavia).[citation needed] A so-called "triangle of brotherhood" has developed between the most heavily supported left-wing fan clubs of Marseille, Livorno, and AEK Athens, namely between Commando Ultras 84, Brigate Autonome Livornesi 99, and Original 21.[citation needed] Their connection is mostly an ideological one.[citation needed] They also have a connection with Adana Demirspor (Şimşekler) and Celtic.[citation needed] Serie A Runners-up (2): 1919–20,[citation needed] 1942–43[citation needed] Serie B Winners (2): 1932–33,[citation needed] 1936–37[citation needed] Runners-up (1): 1939–40[citation needed] Other Promotions (3): 2003–04,[citation needed] 2008–09,[citation needed] 2012–13[citation needed] Serie C/Serie C1/Lega Pro Winners (3): 1963–64,[citation needed] 2001–02,[citation needed] 2017–18[citation needed] Promotions (5): 1954–55,[citation needed] 1959–60,[citation needed] 1963–64,[citation needed] 2001–02,[citation needed] 2017–18[citation needed] Serie C2/Lega Pro Seconda Divisione Winners (1): 1983–84[citation needed] Runners-up (1): 1995–96,[citation needed] 1996–97[citation needed] Promotions (2): 1983–84,[citation needed] 1996–97[citation needed] Coppa Italia Serie C/Coppa Italia Lega Pro Winners (1): 1986–87[citation needed] Runners-up (1): 2001-02[citation needed] "Comunicato Ufficiale n. 11 del 26/08/2021" (PDF).
