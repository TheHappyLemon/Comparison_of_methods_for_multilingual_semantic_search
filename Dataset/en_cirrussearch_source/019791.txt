Lake St Lucia (Lake Saint Lucia) is an estuarine lake system in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It is the largest estuarine lake in Southern Africa, covering an area of approximately 350 square kilometres (140 sq mi), and falls within the iSimangaliso Wetland Park (a World Heritage Site). The lake was named Santa Lucia by Manuel Perestrello on 13 December 1575, the day of the feast of Saint Lucy. It was later renamed to St. Lucia. More than 2,180 species of flowering plants have been documented in the St Lucia lake system. St Lucia Lake harbours rich fauna, including crocodiles, hippopotami, monitor lizards, over 400 bird species, invertebrates, and the occasional bull shark.
