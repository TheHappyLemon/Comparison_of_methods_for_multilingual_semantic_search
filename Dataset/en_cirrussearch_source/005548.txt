.gd is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Grenada. Domain name registrars such as GoDaddy have stopped accepting new registrations for .vg, .tc and .gd domain names since March 2013.[failed verification] This is the result of a dispute over the ownership and control of AdamsNames Ltd. which had been the accredited registry by the IANA for those top level domains. A former partner of AdamsNames Ltd. created a new company Meridian Ltd. which claimed to be the new accredited registry. The National Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (NTRC) made the decision to move the .gd zone under the management of KSRegistry, running as nicGD, as of 1 May 2013. This was to ensure the integrity of the zone and to allow it remain in control and under the responsibility of the NTRC. KSRegistry, as a result of acquiring the zone, had to resolve any discrepancies that may have occurred during the dispute and chose to freeze the zone from changes until May 21, 2013. Since then, the zone has been re-opened with new policies. Internet in Grenada "Domains - GoDaddy Help US". About .vg Domains. Retrieved 2020-01-27. GmbH, Key-Systems (2013-03-11).
