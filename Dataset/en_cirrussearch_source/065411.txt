Club Atlético Platense is an Argentine sports club based in Florida, Buenos Aires. The club nickname is Calamar (Squid) after the journalist Palacio Zino said that the team moved "like a squid in its ink". Although the club hosts many activities, Platense is mostly known for its football team. Despite being relegated from the Primera División in 1999, it remains on the top 20 of the All-time Argentine Primera División table. Since 2021, Platense again currently competes in the Argentine Primera División, the top division of the Argentine league system. The team was recently promoted after beating Estudiantes de Río Cuarto in the "Torneo Reducido" final. Founded on 25 May 1905, Platense played in the second division from 1956 to 1964, and from 1972 to 1976, when the team finally won its first title, the Primera B championship that allowed Platense to play in the Primera División. The club achieved cult status in the late 1970s as they repeatedly staved off relegation through a series of "last-day miracles" (relegating other teams as Temperley after defeating them in decisive matches played to keep a place in the first division. Platense survived at the top level of Argentine football until finally succumbing to relegation in 1999. This would be the beginning of a steep decline: Platense was subsequently relegated to the regionalised third division, Primera B Metropolitana, at the end of the 2001–02 season. On 17 May 2006, Platense won its second title and was promoted back to the Argentine second division Nacional B. But on 8 May 2010 The Squid would be relegated again to the third category. On 2 May 2018, Platense was directly promoted to the second division after winning the Primera B Metropolitana title in a victory over club Estudiantes de Caseros. In 2021, Platense would make their return to the Primera División for the first time in 22 years after defeating Estudiantes de Río Cuarto on penalties to earn promotion. The club's main claim to fame during these lean years is the success of Momo and David Trezeguet, who had debuted at Platense but after playing only 5 matches in Argentine Primera División was transferred to AS Monaco. Platense's fans base can be found in Vicente López, Olivos and Florida towns (all of them part of the Vicente López Partido), as well as in Villa Urquiza and Saavedra neighbourhoods. The club is also cited in Bioy Casares's book El Sueño de los héroes ("Dream of Heroes" ISBN 0-7043-2634-5). Among its supporters, the Tango music singer Roberto Goyeneche and the British author Chris Moss were probably the most notable fans.

According to the official version, the first Platense shirts were red with black sleeves (the colors of the Platense stable), but the club then adopted the colors of the jacket (white) and cap (brown) worn by the jockey who won the race in 1905. Nevertheless, another historians state that Platense wore white shirts (with no brown elements) until 1908, when a club executive added a horizontal (brown) patch to the shirts with the purpose of covering the mud stains caused by the frecquent flooding in the zone where the stadium stood, (Av. del Libertador and Manuela Pedraza in Belgrano, Buenos Aires). The club has issued some red shirts (as alternate kits) to commemorate the first colors of the club. The model released in 1997 and made by Puma caused great controversy among their fans due to its similarity with the Argentinos Juniors (which had a fierce rivalry with Platense) kit. Along their history, Platense has also introduced some variants to the brown and white colors, such as a vertical stripes shirt worn in 1922 (which had a commemorative edition in 2012). During a long period of their history, Platense also wore a brown shirt with white sleeves. Notes The precise date when Platense adopted the white and brown colors is unclear although it is believed that it happened soon after their foundation. This is regarded as the 'classic' shirt model, although Platense have also worn white only (1971, 1976), maroon only (1953–55, 1977), and even other shirt models along their history. Although Platense have varied their models several times along their history, this is included due to be distinctive from the others. As of 28 August 2023.
