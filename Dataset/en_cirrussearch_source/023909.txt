Year 1282 (MCCLXXXII) was a common year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. March – Welsh forces under Prince Dafydd ap Gruffydd, brother of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, attack and take control of Hawarden Castle. The garrison is massacred and Constable Roger de Clifford is taken prisoner. Llywelyn who has sworn fealty to King Edward I (Longshanks), joins Dafydd in his revolt against the English. Their actions lead to the final English conquest of Wales, by Edward. March 30 – War of the Sicilian Vespers: A group of Sicilian conspirators begins an uprising against the rule of King Charles I; over the next six weeks, thousands of French are killed. The rebellion forces Charles to abandon the planned crusade against the Byzantines, while still en route to the target city of Constantinople and allows King Peter III (the Great) to take over rule of the island from Charles (which in turn leads to Peter's excommunication by Pope Martin IV). May 1 – Battle of Forlì: A French expeditionary army under Jean d'Eppe launches an assault on Forlì and breaches the outer wall. While they plunder the suburbs, Guido I da Montefeltro sends a small force out the gate on the opposite side of the city. In an ambush, Guelph and Ghibelline forces defeat the main army of d'Eppe, who is forced to retreat to Faenza. He requests Martin IV for more reinforcements, but this is refused. Summer – An Aragonese expeditionary army under Peter III lands in North Africa in Collo, in proclaimed support of a rebellion of the governor of Constantine, Ibn Wazir. The revolt is suppressed by Abu Ishaq Ibrahim I, ruler of the Hafsid Sultanate. Peter, wary of the situation in Sicily, sails off and fails to take advantage of the state of rebellion in North Africa. Ibrahim stabilizes his power and styles himself emir of the sultanate. June – The 24-year-old Prince Sancho, heir to the throne of Castile, assembles a coalition of nobles and starts a massive rebellion against his father, King Alfonso X (the Wise). He dispatches his brothers into the realm to claim strategically important cities and castles. Only the cities of Seville, Murcia, and Badajoz remain loyal to Alfonso, who becomes isolated politically and abandoned by most of his family. June 17 – Battle of Llandeilo Fawr: English forces led by Gilbert de Clare are ambushed and defeated by Welsh troops at Llandeilo. English expansion into southern Wales is halted. June 26 – King Denis I (the Poet King) marries the 11-year-old Elizabeth of Aragon, daughter of Peter III (the Great), in Trancoso. Elizabeth received the towns of Óbidos, Abrantes, and Porto de Mós as part of her dowry. Denis, known for his poetry, writes several poems and books himself, with topics of administration and hunting. During his reign, Lisbon becomes one of Europe's centers of art and culture. July – Alfonso X (the Wise) allies himself with Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd al-Haqq, ruler of the Marinid Sultanate, who crosses the straits, and establishes a camp at Zahara de la Sierra, in southern Spain. Alfonso offers the Castilian royal crown of his father and grandfathers as a pledge of re-payment of a loan. Out of pity, Abu Yusuf gives him 100,000 gold dinars. August – Castilian forces under Sancho lay siege to Badajoz, who eventually retreat as the combined armies of Alfonso X (the Wise) relieve the city. Shortly after, Alfonso marches to Córdoba and demands the key of the city. This is refused by Diego López V de Haro, speaking on behalf of the magnates. Meanwhile, the Marinids plunder the Guadalquivir valley. August 30 – Peter III (the Great) traveling with his fleet on a military expedition against Tunis, ends up in the Sicilian town of Trapani, after he was asked by the inhabitants of Palermo to help in the fight against Charles I. September 4 – Peter III (the Great) is proclaimed "King of Sicily". Charles is forced to flee across the Strait of Messina, only to be content with the Kingdom of Naples (ruling a part of the Italian Peninsula with Martin IV). September or October – Battle of Lake Hód: Hungarian forces led by King Ladislaus IV successfully repel and defeat an invading Cuman army. Ladislaus receives the title "the Cuman" for his heroic victory. November – Castilian forces under Alfonso X (the Wise) reconquer Córdoba. Pope Martin IV issues a papal bull, forcing Sancho and his nobles to proclaim their allegiance to Alfonso ending the rebellion. November 6 – Battle of Moel-y-don: English forces led by Luke de Tany are ambushed and defeated by Welsh troops, while crossing over a floating bridge to the island of Anglesey. December 11 – Battle of Orewin Bridge: English forces (some 6,000 men) under Edward I (Longshanks) defeat a Welsh army near Cilmeri. Llywelyn ap Gruffudd is killed. December 27 – King Rudolf I invests his sons, Albert I and Rudolf II, as co-rulers of the duchies of Austria and Styria, and lays the foundation of the House of Habsburg in these territories. Dutch forces led by Floris V, count of Holland, attack and defeat the West Frisians at the battle of Vronen. He succeeds in retrieving the body of his father, William II, some 26 years dead. King Stefan Dragutin breaks his leg while hunting and becomes ill. He abdicates the throne in favor of his younger brother, Stefan Milutin, who becomes ruler of Serbia (until 1321). Peter III (the Great) obtains the support of Nasrid Granada preparing for the incoming Aragonese Crusade, led by Philip the Fair of France. Daniel of Moscow, youngest son of Alexander Nevsky, is mentioned during this year as an independent Prince of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. This Duchy will be a vassal state of the Golden Horde until 1471, later evolving into the Tsardom of Russia. Hertford College is founded, at the University of Oxford. The form for the Trial of the Pyx, during which it is confirmed that newly minted coins conform to required standards, is established. The first evidence is discovered of the existence of consolidated public debt in Bruges, confirming the expansion of use of annuities, to fund government expenditure to the Low Countries. The most recent eruption of Larderello, a volcano in southern Tuscany, is observed. The technology of watermarks is introduced by paper manufacturers of Bologna, Italy. John Peckham, archbishop of Canterbury, orders all the synagogues of London to close, and forbids Jewish doctors from practicing on non-Jews. Construction of Albi Cathedral in Languedoc begins.
