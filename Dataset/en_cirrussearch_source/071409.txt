The Chinese Silver Panda (Chinese: 熊猫银币; pinyin: xióngmāo yínbì) is a series of silver bullion coins issued by the People's Republic of China. The design of the panda is changed every year and minted in different sizes and denominations, ranging from 0.5 troy oz. to 1 kilogram. Starting in 2016, Pandas switched to metric sizes. The 1 troy ounce coin was reduced to 30 grams, while the 5 troy ounce coin was reduced to 150 grams. There is also a Gold Panda series issued featuring the same designs as the Silver Panda coins. The first Silver Panda coins—issued 10 yuan Panda bullion in 1983, 1984, and 1985—were proof quality, with a precious metal content of 27 grams of 0.900 fine silver and a diameter of 38.6 mm. Mintages were only 10,000 for each year. No Silver Pandas were issued in 1986. The 1987 Silver Panda coins were minted in proof quality from 1 troy oz. of sterling (.925 fine) silver, with a diameter of 40 mm. There are several mints that produced Silver Panda coins over the years, including: Shanghai, Shenyang, and Shenzhen. Unlike coins made by US and German mints that carry mintmarks to distinguish their origin, Chinese mints generally do not carry mintmarks. In certain years there are minor variations in the coin design—such as the size of the date, and temple that allows the originating mint to be determined. An example is 1996 where different mints produced coins with minor variations in the font size of the date on the obverse side of the coins. In 2015 the Gold and Silver Panda coins were not labeled with metal fineness and weight. This information returned in 2016 when the 1 troy ounce coin was replaced by the 30-gram coin (one troy ounce is approximately 31.1 grams). The official distributor in China for the Silver and Gold Panda coins is the China Gold Coin Incorporation (CGCI). As of 2020, the highest-priced coin is a perfect 1983 proof panda worth $16,430. The highest-priced, non-proof coin is a perfect large-date 1991 panda worth $3,100. Taking the 1-ounce silver coin as an example, the authentic coin has a thickness of only about 2.6 millimeters, while the thickness of the counterfeit coin exceeds 3 millimeters. If they are of the same thickness, the counterfeit coin will not weigh 31.1 grams. The diagonal reeding was first introduced in the 2001 D (Domestic) Gold Panda Coins. This feature was introduced to other Chinese Panda Coins in 2002. The center of the obverse is a depiction of The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests located in the Temple of Heaven complex in Beijing. The Hall was built between 1406 and 1420. Chinese characters on top say "中华人民共和国", meaning the People's Republic of China and the bottom the year of issue. If the issue is a commemorative issue, the theme will be marked here also. The reverse shows portraits of the giant panda that changes every year (except for 2001 and 2002, which share the same design). There are many varieties of types of coins issued: Bulk Uncirculated Proof Gilding (either side or both) Colored (only obverse side known) Privy marked for a commemorative issue Extra wording of a special event. For example, where the coins will be sold, such as a coin show or to commemorate an event or place.
