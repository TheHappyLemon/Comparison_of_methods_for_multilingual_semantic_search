The club was excluded from the league for match fixing and he returned to junior football. On 11 August 2017, he joined Italian club Verona on loan with an option to buy and was assigned to the club's under-19 squad. On 30 May 2018, Verona exercised their option to purchased his rights, and he signed a 3-year contract with the club. In the 2018–19 season, he continued to play for Verona's youth team. He received two call-ups to the senior squad (once in Serie B and once in Coppa Italia), but did not appear on the field. On 31 January 2020, he joined Serie C club Rende on loan. He made his professional debut on 9 February 2020 in a game against Paganese. On 16 February, he scored his first professional goal, an added-time equalizer in a 2–2 draw against Potenza. On 26 February, he made his first start against Cavese. After two more games, the season was abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. On 14 September, he signed with Serie C club Mantova. On 16 July 2021, he returned to Latvia and signed with Riga. On 9 March 2022, he was loaned to FK Auda for a season. He amassed 50 appearances for Latvia on different junior levels. In November 2018, he was called up for the first time to the senior Latvia national football team for the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League games against Kazakhstan and Andorra, but remained on the bench on that occasion.
