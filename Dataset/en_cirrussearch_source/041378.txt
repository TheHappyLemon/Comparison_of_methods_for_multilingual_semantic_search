André Martín Carrillo Díaz (born 14 June 1991) is a Peruvian professional footballer who plays as a winger or second striker for Saudi First Division League club Al-Qadsiah and the Peru national team. He is nicknamed La Culebra (The Snake). Carrillo began his senior career in 2009 with Alianza Lima. Two years later, he moved to Sporting CP in Portugal and debuted for his country. In 2016, he joined crosstown rivals Benfica and went on winning the league, cup and super cup in his first season. He was then loaned out for two consecutive seasons, the first to English club Watford in the Premier League, and the second to Al-Hilal in the Saudi Professional League. At international level, Carrillo has earned over 90 caps for Peru since making his debut in 2011, and has represented his nation at four editions of the Copa América (finishing third in 2011 and 2015, and second in 2019) and the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Carrillo began his football career in the Lima-based youth system of Esther Grande de Bentín, in 2004. Then in 2007 he joined Alianza Lima's youth setup. Finally in 2009, he was moved up to Alianza Lima's first team and made his league debut in the Torneo Descentralizado on 5 December in the last round of the regular season. Playing at home in the Matute Stadium, he entered the pitch in the 75th minute as match eventually finished in 2–2 draw against Universidad César Vallejo. On 6 May 2011, it was reported that Carrillo signed a five-year contract with Sporting CP. He was quickly included in the first team and was an unused substitute for the league games in round 2 and 3. Then in matchday 5 and playing from the start, he made his Primeira Liga debut on 19 September 2011 in Sporting's 3–2 away win over Rio Ave FC. He was in the starting line-up again in his second match and provided his first assist in his side's 3–0 win over Vitória Setúbal. Later he provided two assists in Sporting's 6–1 victory over Gil Vicente. Then in his eleventh match, he scored his first league goal in the 74th minute, but it was not enough to avoid a 2–1 away defeat to Braga. On 2 February 2016, Sporting informed that Carrillo had signed a contract with city rivals Benfica until 2021. In September 2020, it was revealed that 50% of Carrillo's economic rights at Sporting were owned by a third party based in the British Virgin Islands, set up by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. The revelation caused controversy as Carrillo had played against Abramovich's Chelsea in 2014 without this being declared. Carrillo officially joined Portuguese defending champions Benfica on 1 July for the 2016–17 season. He was an unused substitute as the team won the 2016 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira 3–0 against Braga on 7 August. He played 20 games and scored twice as they won the league; the team also won the Taça de Portugal and he netted against Estoril in the semi-finals. He started only three league games as manager Rui Vitória preferred Eduardo Salvio and Franco Cervi; this was one start fewer than in his final season at Sporting. On 24 August 2017, Carrillo joined English side Watford on a season-long loan with the option for a permanent transfer. He was signed by his former Sporting manager Marco Silva. He made his debut two days later in a goalless draw away to Brighton & Hove Albion, coming on two minutes into the second half as a substitute for injured defender Craig Cathcart. He played 30 total games for the team from Vicarage Road, scoring the opener in a 2–1 home loss to Swansea City in the Premier League on 30 December, and in a 3–0 win over Bristol City in the FA Cup third round a week later. For the 2018–19 season, Carrillo was loaned again, this time to Al-Hilal FC in Saudi Arabia. On 23 July 2019, Carrillo signed a four-year contract with the club. In the opening leg of the 2019 AFC Champions League Final on 9 November, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 home win over Urawa Red Diamonds; Al-Hilal went on to win the title following a 3–0 aggregate victory, which allowed them to qualify for the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup. On 13 August 2023, Carrillo joined Saudi First Division League club Al-Qadsiah. In March 2011, Carrillo was called up by manager Sergio Markarián for two friendly matches in Europe; In May that year he was called up to play in the Kirin Cup. At the 2011 Copa América in Argentina, he made his debut in the final group match against rivals Chile, coming on in the 76th minute for Antonio Gonzales and scoring the only goal as an own goal in added time. On 15 August 2012, Carrillo scored his first international goal, the only one of a friendly win away to Costa Rica. His second on 3 July 2015 was in a 2–0 victory against Paraguay in the 2015 Copa América Third Place Match. Carrillo was absent from the national team for over a year until his return in October 2016, having been sidelined due to a lack of playing time at his club. He started all three games of a group-stage elimination at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia; his goal in a 2–0 win over Australia in the last match was Peru's first at the World Cup in 36 years. Carrillo was part of the Peru team that came runners-up to Brazil in the 2019 Copa América; he played the first 71 minutes of the 3–1 loss to the host team. On 8 October the following year, he scored twice in a 2–2 draw away to Paraguay, at the start of an unsuccessful campaign to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. At the 2021 Copa América in Brazil, Carrillo scored decisive goals in group games against Ecuador (draw) and Venezuela (win). In the quarter-finals, he assisted a goal by Gianluca Lapadula but was later sent off, as his team required a penalty shootout to advance past Paraguay.
