Berehove (Ukrainian: Берегове; Hungarian: Beregszász) is a city in Zakarpattia Oblast, western Ukraine. It is situated near the border with Hungary. It is the cultural centre of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine, and Hungarians constitute roughly half (a plurality) of its population. The city serves as the administrative center of Berehove Raion. It has a population of 23,325 (2022 estimate). The city has many different variations of spelling its name: Romanian: Bereg, Rusyn: Берегово (translit. Berehovo), Russian: Берегово (translit. Beregovo), Belarusian: Берагава (Łacinka Bierahava), Czech and Slovak: Berehovo, Yiddish: בערעגסאז, Beregsaz, German: Bergsaß, Polish: Bereg Saski. Residents of Berehove voted on October 31, 2010, in a referendum on renaming the town to Beregszász, its Hungarian-language name. Voter turnout was less than 52%, with 4,688 voting for renaming, 4,358 against, and 1,016 invalid ballots. Part of the city is also a near adjacent village of Zatyshne of 504 people that has its representation in the city's council. Hungarian was made a regional language in Berehove in September 2012; meaning it would be used in the town's administrative office work and documents. This was made possible after new legislation on languages in Ukraine was passed in the summer of 2012. As of December 2020, all decisions of Zakarpattia's local councils on the functioning of regional languages, including Hungarian in Berehove, were cancelled.
