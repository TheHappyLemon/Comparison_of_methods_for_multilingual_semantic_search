Kaspars Daugaviņš (born May 18, 1988) is a Latvian professional ice hockey player for Dukla Michalovce of the Slovak Extraliga. Daugaviņš has played professionally in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Ottawa Senators and Boston Bruins. The Senators selected him in the third round, 91st overall, in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. As a youth, Daugaviņš played in the 2002 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Riga. After the Toronto St. Michael's Majors failed to qualify for the playoffs in the 2006–07 season, the Ottawa Senators assigned Daugaviņš to the Binghamton Senators to finish the 2006–07 AHL season. In 11 games with Binghamton, Daugaviņš had two goals, both coming against the Albany River Rats goaltender Tyler Weiman in a 5–4 Binghamton win. On June 1, 2007, Daugaviņš signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Ottawa Senators. He spent the 2009–10 season with Binghamton, scoring 21 goals and 46 points in 72 games as the team failed to reach the playoffs. Daugaviņš also made his NHL debut on January 14, 2010, against the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden, going pointless in 8:26 of ice time in a 2–0 Ottawa victory. Daugaviņš scored his first NHL goal on October 30, 2011, beating Jonas Gustavsson of the Toronto Maple Leafs in a 3–2 Ottawa victory. As the 2011–12 season progressed, Daugaviņš became a regular in the Ottawa lineup, playing 65 games and scoring five goals and six assists. In July 2012, he was scheduled for an arbitration hearing with the Senators, but the salary negotiation process was avoided when he agreed with the team to a one-year, one-way deal worth $635,000. After his fifth season in the KHL and completing his third season with Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod in 2017–18, Daugaviņš left as a free agent to sign a two-year contract with his fourth KHL club, Spartak Moscow, on May 3, 2018. After two productive seasons with Spartak, Daugaviņš left as a free agent, signing a one-year contract with Vityaz Podolsk on May 3, 2020. On June 10, 2021, Daugaviņš returned to the National League and signed a two-year deal with SC Bern. He left Bern after just one season with the team, signing with German club, Iserlohn Roosters of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), on August 8, 2022. In the 2022–23 season with the Roosters, he led the team in scoring with 21 goals and 49 points through 55 regular season games. With Iserlohn missing the playoffs for a second consecutive season, he left the club at the conclusion of his contract on March 10, 2023. On September 13, 2023, Daugaviņš signed a two-year contract with Dukla Michalovce of the Slovak Extraliga. Daugaviņš represented Latvia as its captain at the 2023 IIHF World Championship where he recorded three goals and four assists and won a bronze medal, Latvia's first ever IIHF World Championship medal.
