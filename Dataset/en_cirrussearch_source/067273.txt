Chess.com is an internet chess server and social networking website. The site has a freemium model in which some features are available for free, and others are available for accounts with subscriptions. Live online chess can be played against other users in daily, rapid, blitz or bullet time controls, with a number of chess variants available. Chess versus a chess engine, computer analysis, chess puzzles and teaching resources are offered. As one of the largest chess platforms in the world, Chess.com achieved the milestone of 100 million users on December 16, 2022 and has about 11 million daily active users as of April 2023. Chess.com has hosted online tournaments including Titled Tuesdays, the PRO Chess League, the Speed Chess Championships, PogChamps, Online Chess Olympiads and computer vs. computer events. The domain Chess.com was originally set up in 1995 by Aficionado, a company based in Berkeley, California to sell Chess Mentor, a chess tutoring software program. In 2005, Internet entrepreneur Erik Allebest and partner Jarom "Jay" Severson, who met as undergraduate students at Brigham Young University, bought the domain name and assembled a team of software developers, redeveloping the site as a chess portal. The site was relaunched in 2007, having heavy campaigning and promotion on social media. Two years later, Chess.com acquired a similar chess social networking site, chesspark.com. In October 2013, Chess.com acquired the Amsterdam-based chess news site chessvibes.com as well. This news site, founded and operated by Dutch chess journalist Peter Doggers, continued to cover chess tournaments in a digital setting. The website reached a milestone in 2014, when it announced that over a billion live games had been played on the site, including 100 million correspondence games. In January 2016, Chess.com announced a two-year overhaul of its previous interface (titled 'v3'). The site introduced features including computer analysis of games, and the chess variants of crazyhouse, three-check chess, king of the hill, chess960 and bughouse. Chess.com reached another milestone in June 2017, as the 2,147,483,647th (= 231-1) game was played, which caused the iOS app to stop working for those with 32-bit Apple devices. This occurred because of an integer overflow problem whereby the number was too large to be represented in the number of storage bits that were used. In May 2018, Chess.com acquired the 3300+ Elo-rated commercial chess engine Komodo, which ranked third behind Stockfish and Houdini at the time of acquisition. In conjunction, the Komodo team announced the addition of the probabilistic method of Monte Carlo tree search machine learning, the same methods used by the recent chess projects AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero. In November 2020, Chess.com acquired the rights to broadcast the World Chess Championship 2021, which is broadcast on live-streaming platform Twitch. In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chess.com published two articles that were critical of the invasion and replaced Russian and Belarusian flags with grey flags that linked to these articles. In retaliation, Chess.com was blocked in Russia. The site blocked Sergey Karjakin, Russian (formerly Ukrainian) grandmaster, over his support for the invasion, and Karjakin in turn supported Russia's block of the website. In September 2022, Chess.com was caught in the furor of a controversy regarding cheating in professional chess games. A controversy erupted with accusations by grandmaster Magnus Carlsen against Hans Niemann. Leaked emails revealed that some people cheated on the Chess.com platform in games involving prize money and that Chess.com removed some players' accounts, including grandmaster Maxim Dlugy, who had been found to be cheating. In August 2023, a US District Court judge dropped the lawsuit filed by Niemann, ending the scandal. In November 2022, The Chess.com Global Championship was inaugurated with a $1,000,000 prize pool. 8 players that advanced from the CGC Knockout competed for a $500,000 total prize fund and Global Champion title in the finals taking place in Toronto, Canada. Wesley So became the first Chess.com Global Champion, defeating Nihal Sarin in the finals with a match score of 4.5–1.5. Chess.com announced it had over 100,000,000 members in December 2022. In January 2023, Chess.com added in five new "cat" chessbots, including Mittens. These bots were removed and replaced by AI bots in February 2023. In January 2023, due to an influx of traffic, Chess.com's databases crashed. Chess.com operates on a freemium business model. Some features are free but others are unavailable or limited in some respects until a subscription is paid. Users can play against other players in a variety of time controls which are grouped into Rapid, Blitz, Bullet, Daily, and Monthly (correspondence chess). A number of chess variants are available on the live server, including crazyhouse, three-check, four-player, King of the Hill, chess960, atomic, Racing Kings, Duck Chess and bughouse. Users can also play against a computer. Along with the standard computer, it has bots representing popular streamers and top chess players. One such engine was Mittens, which became popular in early 2023. There are roughly 600,000 puzzles in the Chess.com database. A player gets a rating based on their performance and speed in solving the puzzles. It offers other special modes of puzzles such as puzzle rush and puzzle battle. Everyday, one puzzle is chosen as the Daily Puzzle which can be played directly from the homepage. Puzzle Rush is a special mode of puzzles in which the player has to solve as many puzzles as they can within the selected time. If the player solves three puzzles incorrectly, their rush finishes. Puzzle Battle is another special mode of puzzles in which a player competes with another player to solve the most puzzles in the given time of three minutes. If a player solves three puzzles incorrectly, they cannot solve any more puzzles. The player who solves the most puzzles is the winner and the rating of the players change accordingly. Players also gain season points, which reset at the start of every month. Puzzle Survival is another special mode of puzzles in which a player attempts to solve the most puzzles with no time limit. If the player solves three puzzles incorrectly, their run finishes and their score is recorded. Every day Chess.com adds a daily puzzle that gets harder throughout the week, Monday has the easiest puzzle while Sunday has the hardest. Every time a daily puzzle is completed the player gets a streak, but if they don't do the daily puzzle on time, they will lose the streak. In addition to online games, the website has options to play against computers of varying strengths. Games played against computer opponents are not rated and will not affect the ratings given for playing human opponents. The website provides the Komodo chess engine with a scalable difficulty feature. In addition, there are computer personalities that simulate conversation based on actions through the game such as checks and captures. These bots will also play with their styles based on their given personality. With the freemium model the website is built on, the first personality bot in each skill level is free to play against, with the rest being unlocked by purchasing a membership. In addition to the default personalities, there are computer personalities that resemble streamers such as xQc, Pokimane, Andrea Botez, and other PogChamps players. Chess.com has a unique feature of lessons. The lessons have videos which explain the topic and challenges which are puzzles regarding the topic explained in the videos. Contributors can create lessons but some are created by the core Chess.com team. There are multiple stages of difficulty in the lessons ranging from beginner to advanced, as well as specialized lessons for specific openings. Torch is a chess engine created by Chess.com. Torch has finished second in several Chess.com Computer Chess Championship events, only behind Stockfish in each case. It initially participated in the tournament under the name "Mystery". It is freely useable through Chess.com's analysis page. It has also been tested by some chess engine rating lists. The team behind Torch is composed of Andrew Grant (author of Ethereal), Finn Eggers and Kim Kåhre (authors of Koivisto), Jay Honnold (author of Berserk), and Michael Whiteley and Dietrich Kappe (current authors of Dragon). The former authors of Dragon, Mark Lefler and Larry Kaufman, are advisors on this project. The development of Torch is supported by many open-source tools, including pytorch-nnue, Cutechess, and OpenBench. Torch developers have stated that the entire source code of Torch is original, with no code being used from any other engine. Chess.com has a policy against the use of chess engines in all forms of the game, except where "specifically permitted (such as a computer tournament)". It utilizes algorithms and statistical data to catch players using engines in games and bans many on a daily basis, and employs six moderators to prevent cheating. Chess.com has a news section in which reporters post reports of major chess tournaments around the world as well as the results of major Chess.com tournaments such as the Speed Chess Championship. Additional features include chess forums, articles, downloads, opening databases, teams, live broadcasts, online coaching and a game database with millions of games. The company publishes a large number of articles on a variety of chess-related topics, including chess strategy, opening theory and history. Regular contributors include Gregory Serper, Bruce Pandolfini, Sam Shankland, Dan Heisman, Jeremy Silman, Simon Williams, Daniel Naroditsky, Natalia Pogonina and Daniel Rensch. Chess.com offers statistics based on all games played for premium members. Chess.com runs the subsidiary site chesskid.com for chess players that are under the minimum age requirement for Chess.com. ChessKid focuses on a child-friendly environment aimed towards chess improvement for beginners to club players. It has a guardianship program in which parents and authorized coaches can overlook the child's progress over time, to see statistics about their progress in tactics or how many videos they watched so that they can give encouragement and tips on how to improve. ChessKid features no advertising. ChessKid.com has run a yearly online championship called CONIC (the ChessKid Online National Invitational Championship), since 2012 which is recognized by the United States Chess Federation. According to David Petty, the event organizer in 2013, The online component [of CONIC] makes it unique because, normally, national championships require the players to fly in and stay in the same place. We had to ask special permission for the tournament because it is a rated tournament and there is a much higher chance for cheating. ChessKid has made agreements and partnerships with chess associations to bring the educational benefit of chess to children in schools. In 2014, for a trial period, all signups to the ICA (Illinois Chess Association) included a free gold member subscription to ChessKid. They have a long-term partnership with the NTCA (North Texas Chess Academy) which gives children access to online instructors. In August 2022, the Play Magnus Group accepted an offer to be acquired by Chess.com at a value of 800 million kr (US$80 million). The Play Magnus Group owns brands and businesses including the chess server chess24, the mobile app Play Magnus, the Champions Chess Tour, and the chess improvement website Chessable. On December 16, 2022, the acquisition was officially closed. According to Dot Esports, the Play Magnus Group was unable to make a "sustainable profit" on anything but Chessable, and the merge left "no other realistic chess competitor" except the free, open-source Lichess. Chess.com has held the Speed Chess Championship annually since 2016, involving a single-elimination tournament featuring some of the world's best players. Nakamura has won five championships, while Carlsen has won three. Due to the very interesting format of the competition, the tournament is very popular among chess fans. Every year, thousands of chess players watch the live broadcast. The most important elements of the tournament formula: 16-player single-elimination bracket Matches consist of three segments: 90 minutes of 5+1, 60 minutes of 3+1, and 30 minutes of 1+1. The player with the most cumulative points at the end of the match wins. Games that start before the time for a segment runs out count toward the final score. Players can resign from the match within the last 10 minutes of the 1+1 segment, with the player's win percentage being capped at 35%. In case of equal number of points - tiebreaks: A four-game 1+1 match. A single bidding armageddon game with a base time of 5 minutes. The Daily Chess Championship is one of the largest online chess tournaments. It has been held annually on the Chess.com platform since 2018. While the first edition of Daily Chess Championships had just over 7,000 players, after 5 years, in 2023, due to the significant interest in the event, the organizer had to limit the number of participants to 35,000. Due to this turnout success, the limits on the number of participants were removed in 2024. This allowed to set another record for the number of chess players in one tournament, which exceeded 60,000. The tournament always starts on January 1 and, depending on the number of participants, consists of 4 or 5 rounds. All players are divided into groups (up to 12 people ), and only the winners advance to the next round. Players play in each round a maximum of 22 games simultaneously (with each opponent as White and Black), with a maximum of one day allocated for each move. So it can be considered a form of correspondence chess. The winner of the Championship is the player who accumulates the most points in the final round. The USCL was a nationwide national chess league in the United States between 2005 and 2016. Chess.com hosted the event in 2013. The PRO Chess League was the result of the US Chess League changing its name and format, with faster time controls and a focus on the flexibility of forming and managing teams. Chess.com has hosted the PCL starting in 2017, having a regular and a summer series. Titled Tuesday is an 11-round Swiss-system 3+1 blitz chess tournament held every Tuesday. Grandmaster participants include Hikaru Nakamura, Magnus Carlsen, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Alexander Grischuk, Dmitry Andreikin, Alireza Firouzja, Daniel Naroditsky, Wesley So, and Fabiano Caruana. The first event was held on October 28, 2014, with a prize fund of $500 and was won by Baadur Jobava. The prize fund was gradually upgraded to $5000 per week. As of February 2024, GM Hikaru Nakamura has won a total of 64 tournament wins since October 2020 (becoming the first player to have ever achieved that milestone), followed by GM Dmitry Andreikin with 16, Magnus Carlsen has won three of the events in which he has partaken as of 2017. In June 2018, Chess.com held a special version of the tournament for which the winner would go on to participate in the Isle of Man International which had a prize fund of £144,000. Iranian GM Pouria Darini won the event. Death Matches were introduced in January 2012. They feature titled players taking part in a series of blitz games over a non-stop 3-hour period (5-minute, 3-minute and 1-minute, all with a one-second increment). There have been 38 deathmatches, participants including the grandmasters Hikaru Nakamura, Dmitry Andreikin, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Lê Quang Liêm, Wesley So, Fabiano Caruana, Judit Polgár and Nigel Short. In November 2017, Chess.com held an open tournament, called the Chess.com Computer Chess Championship (CCCC, later CCC), with the ten strongest chess engines, with $2,500 in prize money. The top-two engines competed in a "Superfinal" tournament between the two finalists – Stockfish and Houdini. In the 20-game Superfinal, Stockfish won over Houdini with a score 10.5–9.5. Five games were decisive, with 15 ending in a draw. Of the decisive games, three games were won by Stockfish, and two by Houdini. In August 2018, the site announced that the Chess.com Computer Chess Championship has returned, this time as a non-stop tournament for chess engines. Chess.com has hosted PogChamps, an amateur online tournament featuring Twitch streamers, since 2020. The first PogChamps featured streamers including xQcOW, MoistCr1TiKaL, Ludwig Ahgren, and forsen. New participants from PogChamps 2 included itsHafu and Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson. PogChamps 3, beginning in February 2021, debuted with a wider range of Internet personalities and celebrities, with new competitors including MrBeast, Neekolul, Myth, Pokimane, actor Rainn Wilson, and rapper Logic. List of Internet chess servers Top Chess Engine Championship Since 2020, due to the steadily growing number of players, a 5-round format is necessary. If the number of all players in a given round is not divisible by 12, smaller groups are created. In case all groups cannot be of the same size, players with the highest rankings go to smaller groups. In case of equal points, all winners in the group advance. "About Chess.com". Chess.com.
