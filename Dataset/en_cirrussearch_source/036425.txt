Heneicosylic acid, or heneicosanoic acid, is the organic compound with the formula CH3(CH2)19CO2H. It is the straight-chain 21-carbon saturated fatty acid. It is a colorless solid. It has shown relevance in the production of foams, paints, and related viscous materials. A laboratory preparation involves permanganate oxidation of 1-docosene (CH3(CH2)19CH=CH2).
