While teaching musical acting course in Baltic Russian Institute he got inspired and wrote a musical play Es visur aicināts un izraidīts based on 15th to 20th century Russian poetry.

(Breathe Deeply!). Surprisingly enough, even though the film itself was not shown to public till the end of 80s, its songs, written by the acclaimed Latvian composer Imants Kalniņš, became very popular among Latvian society, and later were performed by Latvian bands ‘Menuets’ and ‘Turaidas roze’. However, as, for example, Hardijs Lediņš put it: ‘I think that nobody has performed the songs by Imants Kalniņš better than Pauls Butkēvičs, - neither ‘Menuets’, nor ‘Turaidas roze’ did’ The members of the ensemble ‘Zvaigznīte’ included such later well-known Latvian musicians as Uldis Stabulnieks, Gunārs Rozenbergs, Dzintars Beķeris, Valdis Eglītis, Andris Vilsons and Jūnijs Vilsons. In 2008 Paul Butkevich together with Elina Cileviča engaged in a new musical project and recorded an album Tu esi, Tu biji, Tu būsi. Butkevich dreams of recording another album in the future with the songs in Russian of his performance 'Es visur aicināts un izraidīts'. "Latvian film to be showcased among Cannes Classics".
