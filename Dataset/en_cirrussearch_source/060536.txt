On 6 February 2013, Loktionov was acquired by the New Jersey Devils in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. He was then assigned to the Devils' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Albany Devils. On 5 March 2014, Loktionov was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes, along with a 2017 conditional third-round draft pick, in exchange for winger Tuomo Ruutu. At the end of the season, the Hurricanes opted not to provide Loktionov with a qualifying offer and as a result, he became an unrestricted free agent on 1 July 2014. Without a club midway into the 2014–15 season, Loktionov signed for the remainder of the season to return to Lokomotiv Yaroslavl in the KHL on 28 November 2014. After three seasons in the KHL with Lokomotiv, Loktionov as a free agent following the 2016–17 season, opted for another attempt at the NHL in accepting a professional try-out to attend his original draft club, the Los Angeles Kings training camp on 14 July 2017. He was released by the Kings on 27 September 2017. Loktionov returned to Russia and continued his tenure with Lokomotiv.

He signed a one-year contract to continue in the KHL with Metallurg Magnitogorsk on 1 May 2019.
