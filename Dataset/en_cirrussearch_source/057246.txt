He led all rookies in points, was named to the First All-Star Team, the All-Rookie Team, and won the Michael Bossy Trophy as the best professional prospect in the league. Prior to the draft Zadina was considered a top prospect, with NHL Central Scouting Bureau describing him as a natural scorer with a great finishing touch. He was the third ranked North American based skater, before he was selected sixth overall in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft by the Detroit Red Wings on 22 June 2018.

Prior to being recalled, he recorded 15 goals and 16 assists in 45 games with the Griffins, ranking third on the team in goals and fourth in points.

On 7 August 2020, with the 2020–21 NHL season delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Zadina having trained in the off-season with HC Oceláři Třinec was loaned by the Red Wings to join the Czech ELH club for the beginning of their season until the resumption of the Red Wings training camp in November. On 6 July 2023, Zadina agreed to a termination of the remaining two years of his contract with the Red Wings, after being placed on waivers.
