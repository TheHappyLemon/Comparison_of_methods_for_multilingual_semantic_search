Note that the Mexican League uses a percentage-based relegation system, in which the team with the worst performance percentage by year (instead of the worst team in the season) is relegated. Under the command of Victor Manuel Vucetich, the team qualified to play-offs in 1996 but because of the relegation they were unable to compete. After some negotiations, the administration of the team was given for ten years to Sinergia Deportiva, a trust-holder run by CEMEX. In 1997, after two consecutive Primera División A championships, the team returned to the Primera División. In 1998, Tigres hired international striker Luis Hernández.

In the play-offs, they beat Santos Laguna in the quarter-finals 1–1 and 3–0 (4–1).

That same tournament they scored the biggest result in a Clásico Regiomontano, beating archrival Monterrey 6–2. In October 2004, Sinergia Deportiva purchased the rights to a franchise in the MISL called the "Monterrey Tigres". However, due to conflicts with the previous MISL franchise "Monterrey Fury", the team elected not to complete the purchase of the team, and the MISL terminated the indoor franchise in December 2004. In the Clausura 2005, Tigres went to postseason and tied with Monarcas Morelia 2–2 and 2–2 (4–4) in the quarter-finals, and Morelia went to the next stage because of the points they achieved in the regular season. In the Apertura 2005, Walter Gaitán finished the season as the top scorer of the tournament and Tigres went to play-offs in 8th place. In the quarter-finals, under the command of the iconic Osvaldo Batocletti, Tigres played the historical "Aztecazo", a way to describe a difficult victory over América or the Mexico national team in their venue, the Estadio Azteca. In the first game, Tigres lost in the Estadio Universitario by a 1–3 score. Against all odds, however, they defeated América in the second game 4–1 for an aggregate scoreline of 5–4, leaving América out of the postseason. In the semi-finals, Tigres drew Monterrey after 1–0 and 1–2 (2–2) scorelines, although Monterrey progressed to the next round because of the points in the tournament.

Tigres responded well to this for Blas Pérez and Manuel Viniegra tied the game 2–2. In the Apertura 2008, under the command of Manuel Lapuente, Tigres ended the tournament as sixth place and qualified for the play-offs. They tied in the quarter-finals against Atlante 1–1 and 1–1 (2–2), though Atlante progressed to semi-finals because they finished the regular season higher than Tigres, in third place. Palos Ayala Juninho Jiménez Torres Nilo Viniegra Salcido Danilinho Álvarez Lobos Mancilla Apertura 2011 Championship starting line-up In 2010, Santiago Martínez presided over the team's worst season in the past few years. On 27 March 2010, after their seventh loss in the season, and with only 25% effectiveness, the fans and media heavily criticized coach Daniel Guzmán. Eventually, Martínez was fired and replaced by a former president of the team, Alejandro Rodríguez. He signed Ricardo Ferretti as the head coach for the third time, upon which the face of the team changed completely. Tigres was saved from relegation and became one of the most competitive teams in the league. With the adherence of Argentine winger Damián Álvarez, Brazilian attacking midfielder Danilinho and Chilean striker Héctor Mancilla to captain Lucas Lobos, the offensive line of Tigres became the so-called "Cuatro Fantásticos" ("Fantastic Four"). In the Clausura 2011 season, Tigres finished the tournament as leader with 35 points and as the best defence in the history of the short seasons, allowing only 9 goals in 17 games. Tigres faced Guadalajara in the postseason. In the first leg of the quarter-finals, Tigres lost 3–1, while in the second they tied to 1–1 at the Estadio Universitario.

In the second, after a total domain of Tigres, and winning 2–0 with goals of Mancilla, Santos tied dramatically 2–2 with goals from Oribe Peralta in the 87th and 90th minutes. With an aggregate score of 3–3, Santos progressed to the next phase because they had finished the regular season in first place. In the Apertura 2012, Tigres replaced Héctor Mancilla with Spanish forward Luis García. Tigres finished in 12th place, thus missing playoffs. Tigres brought in experienced Argentine striker Emanuel Villa while Danilinho returned from his loan to Brazil, giving the team a highly offensive power for the Clausura 2013 season. The regular season ended with Tigres as the leader with 35 points and only two defeats. Querétaro was the eighth-placed and meant to be the rival of Tigres, but was relegated to Ascenso MX, so Monterrey was dragged to postseason. In the away leg of quarter-finals, Monterrey defeated Tigres 1–0 in a game where Monterrey had less ball possession and offensive plays. In the second game, Tigres had to win by 1–0 or by a two-goal advantage because of the away goals rule (3–1, 4–2, 5–3). Tigres came out aggressive and Danilinho scored a goal early in the game. Minutes later, with a game totally handled by Tigres, Israel Jiménez scored an own goal that tied the game at 1–1, and Tigres lost with an aggregate score of 2–1. For the Apertura 2013 tournament, Tigres hired midfielders Guido Pizarro and Édgar Lugo. Finishing the tournament in eight place, the team went to playoffs. In quarter-finals, they faced América, leaders of the tournament and reigning champions.

Their first ever win on the tournament, on 23 February 2005, against Caracas, from Venezuela (home, score: 3–1), and on 13 April 2005 (away, score: 2–5).

Tigres confronted them on 15 March (home, score: 2–2) and on 6 April 2005 (away, score: 0–3).

In this edition, Tigres faced the Universidad Católica from Chile, the Corinthians, from Brazil, and Deportivo Cali, of Colombia. This was a tougher group stage than they had had the previous year, and was one of the toughest in the tournament. However, Tigres qualified for the next round, but only by goal-difference advantage, and after a last minute goal by Carlos Ramírez. Because of its intensity, this group staged produced a lot of memorable games, particularly against Universidad Católica and against Corinthians at home and away. Tigres ended second in the group due to goal difference advantage, in a last minute goal against Universidad Católica, and so qualified again for play-offs. In summary, Tigres played 8 games and produced 3 wins, 3 ties, and two defeats. This performance at the beginning was considerably lacking, and it produced its first penalty kicks experience in Copa Libertadores. On 5 August 2009, Tigres won the final of the 2009 North American SuperLiga against the Chicago Fire at their home stadium in the Chicago's suburb of Bridgeview, Illinois.

They lost in quarterfinals against Seattle Sounders FC by 1–0, 3–1, for an aggregate of 2–3.

The third colour has been inconsistent, sometimes presented as black, white, red, green, copper or dark gold. Tigres' biggest rival is Monterrey. Their derby is called Clásico Regiomontano. On every Clásico the stadium is sold out as soon as tickets go on sale. It is known for being one of the most intense and competed derbies in Mexican football, and is widely regarded as the most important Mexican derby after the Clásico Nacional. Tigres and Monterrey played their first Clásico on 13 July 1974 at the Estadio Universitario, game that ended with a 3–3 draw.

Every season Tigres play in front of a sold-out Estadio Universitario due to their over 39,000 season-ticket holders. Since the reactivation of the domestic cup (Copa MX) in 2012, the Estadio Universitario has registered a full attendance in the cup games as well. After getting relegated and made all of their games Local-PPV in 1996, fans continued their unwavering support during the year it took the club to achieve promotion back to Liga MX. It was the only team in the Ascenso MX that registered a full attendance for every home game during that entire year. Its fan base expands to other states such as Coahuila, Durango, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas, Veracruz and (like many other Liga MX teams) in the US, particularly Texas. Several Mexican sports media have ranked the Tigres' fans as the best in the Liga MX, citing their loyalty during the club's bad streaks. The fans, nicknamed "Incomparables" (Incomparable ones), are the best known travelling support group due to the thousands of members chanting for the team in the away games. Founded in 1998, Libres y Lokos are the biggest group of ultras of the club. On 9 March 2013, over 23,000 fans traveled to the city of San Luis Potosí to support the team in a game against San Luis FC at the Estadio Alfonso Lastras.
