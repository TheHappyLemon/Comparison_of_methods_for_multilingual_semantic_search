AD 31 (XXXI) was a common year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Tiberius and Sejanus (or, less frequently, year 784 Ab urbe condita). The denomination AD 31 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Lucius Aelius Sejanus is named co-Consul to Emperor Tiberius. However, Tiberius becomes aware of Sejanus' treachery and has him arrested and executed. Naevius Sutorius Macro becomes the leader of the Praetorian Guard after Sejanus is executed.
