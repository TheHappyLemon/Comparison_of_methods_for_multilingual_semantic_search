Marwan Mohsen Fahmy Tharwat Gameldin Mahmoud Fahmy (Arabic: مروان محسن فهمي ثروت جمال الدين محمود فهمي; born 26 February 1989) is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Future. Mohsen made his debut with Egypt on 3 September 2011 against Sierra Leone in an 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier, where he also scored his first international goal. After the impressive performance in the Egyptian Second division side[clarification needed] in the first half of the 2009–2010 season, Egyptian Premier League side Petrojet signed him for the rest of the season in the winter transfer window. He made his debut on 13 May 2010 against El Gaish. He earned a spot on Hany Ramzy's Egypt U-23 squad, who were trying to qualify for the 2011 All-Africa Games and the 2012 Summer Olympics, after finishing with a good 2010–11 season with 4 goals. He finished with 2 goals in the unfinished 2011–12 Egyptian Premier League season due to the Port Said Stadium disaster. In early June 2012, Mohsen's Petrojet coach told the media that “He will move to Europe and the board is studying offers from a number of big clubs,” and continued on to say “Marwan Mohsen is one of the best forwards in Egypt and his place is in the big European leagues.” Interest from Egyptian giants Al Ahly and Zamalek as well as European teams grew exponentially as he succeeded with the Egypt U-23 team leading up to the 2012 Summer Olympics. After performing extraordinarily well in the 2012 Toulon Tournament and playing well in 2012 Summer Olympics finishing with incredible goal scoring record (21 goals in 31 matches), Mohsen had the interest from Egyptian, Gulf, and European clubs. In the end of August, he demanded a transfer away from the club (preferably outside Egypt) so that he can "solidify his place in Egypt's first team." Unfortunately, Mohsen got Virus C in September which would see him out of action for 2–3 months. He made his return late October in a friendly match against El Gouna after being 2 months out. He played a part in the match scoring a goal in a 3–1 win for Petrojet. On the first of November, Petrojet assistant coach, Samir Sabry, said that Mohsen had officially been cured from Virus C and had also been carrying Hepatitis C ever since the end of the 2012 London Olympics but he had also cured from that as well. He had later played friendly matches in a 3–1 loss to Wadi Degla, Mohsen scoring his club's only goal, and a 3–0 loss to Haras El-Hodood. Later on, in a friendly match against Egyptian giants Al Ahly, he assisted his side's goal in an entertaining 1–2 loss in front of a large audience. A few weeks later, Petrojet played yet another friendly match with the other Egyptian giants, Ahly rivals Zamalek. Mohsen scored two goals in Petrojet's surprise 2–1 win. After his return from injury, he had scored 4 goals and assisted 2 others in 5 friendlies. As soon the 2012–13 season finally kicked off, Mohsen was at loggerheads with the coaching staff and the board due to his persistence on leaving the club to help ensure his spot on the national team. Mohsen was benched the first game of the season and was subbed off for the next 2 matches. On 23 February 2013, a loan offer from Russian Premier League side Amkar Perm. Mohsen said that he felt like he was being "persecuted" at the club lately and he had accepted the offer and was waiting for the clubs approval. After travelling to their winter training camp in Bulgaria for a week-long trial before open talks with club and player, Petrojet and Amkar Perm couldn't agree on a suitable fee for the player and Mohsen didn't leave the club. Mohsen finished the 2012–13 campaign with 2 goals in 10 games. However, Amkar Perm had restarted talks with Petrojet for a loan or permanent transfer move after the end of the season. On 10 July 2014, Mohsen and fellow Egyptian Hossam Hassan signed for Gil Vicente on a 3-year contract that would keep him at the club until 2017. On 15 July 2015, Mohsen signed a 3-year contract with Ismaily Sc as a free transfer after revoking his contract with Gil Vicente. He scored 14 goals and made 10 assists in 32 appearances in the Egyptian Premier League. On 21 July 2016, it was officially announced by Al Ahly that Mohsen signed a 5-year contract. He was part of Egypt's squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia., playing in all three matches as the team were eliminated in the group stage.
