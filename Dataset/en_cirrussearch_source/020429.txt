Tony Gallopin (born 24 May 1988) is a French former professional road racing cyclist, who competed as a professional from 2008 to 2023. During his career, he won a stage at the 2014 Tour de France and the 2018 Vuelta a España, and also won the 2013 Clásica de San Sebastián. Born in Dourdan, Île-de-France, Gallopin previously resided in Angerville. After two seasons with the RadioShack–Leopard squad, Gallopin joined the Lotto–Belisol team for the 2014 season. On 13 July 2014 Gallopin escaped in a breakaway on Stage 9 of the Tour de France, gaining almost 8 minutes on the leader Vincenzo Nibali to take the yellow jersey. Three days later, on Stage 11, Gallopin escaped from the main peloton on the final descent into Oyonnax to win the stage, just in front of the chasing pack. He won stage 7 of the 2018 Vuelta a España after attacking inside the last 3 kilometers. In May 2019, he was named in the startlist for the Giro d'Italia. Gallopin announced that he would retire from cycling at the end of the 2023 season following a 16-year professional career. Gallopin married fellow racing cyclist and former French national road racing champion Marion Rousse on 18 October 2014. In February 2020, Rousse announced via an Instagram post that the couple had separated. His father Joël Gallopin and his uncle Guy Gallopin also competed professionally as cyclists.
