The Hallenstadion (German: Zürcher Hallenstadion, Zürich Indoor Stadium) is a multi-purpose facility located in the quarter of Oerlikon in northern Zürich. It was home to the ZSC Lions of the National League (NL) and has a capacity of 11,200 spectators. Designed by Bruno Giacometti, it opened on November 4, 1939, and was renovated in 2004–05. The Lions moved out of the Hallenstadion at the end of the 2021/22 season to a new 12,000-seat arena a few kilometers away in the Altstetten area. Construction for the new Swiss Life Arena officially began on 6 March 2019 and was completed towards the end of 2022. Hallenstadion has been a top venue for entertainment in Switzerland as many international artists have performed at the venue, spanning a wide range of genres. Bicycle race events were held in the Hallenstadion in its first year of service, 1939, and most years since then. The classic Zürcher 6-Tagerennen (Zürich 6-day race) began there in 1954, running on its characteristic oval of wooden boards, until the arena closed temporarily for renovation in 2004. The event is run there again now, in a more modern atmosphere. The Hallenstadion hosted the Ice Hockey World Championships in 1998, along with Basel, and was the home stadium of the ZSC Lions ice hockey team. In February 2006, it hosted semi-finals and the final of the 2006 European Men's Handball Championship. It had been the home of the annual Zürich Open, a WTA Tour tennis tournament that was discontinued after 25 years in 2008. On 21 December 2010, tennis returned to the arena with an exhibition featuring Roger Federer against Rafael Nadal, for the benefit of Federer's foundation. On September 29, 2009, the Hallenstadion hosted the 2009 Victoria Cup. The game pit the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks against the Champions Hockey League title-holder, the Zurich Lions. In April 2011, the 2011 IIHF Women's World Championship top division were held at the arena and also at the Deutweg Arena in Winterthur.
