Six tennis events were contested at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. Indoor tennis events, on what were officially called 'covered courts', were held for the first time, along with the usual outdoor events. Women's events were contested, with women's singles (but not women's doubles or mixed doubles) and indoor women's singles. The indoor events were held at the covered courts of the Queen's Club and began on 6 May 1908, ahead of the official start of the Games while the outdoor tournament was played on grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Worple Road from 6 July through 11 July 1908. In total 50 players, 40 men and 10 women, competed. Five nations made their tennis debuts, while five more returned to competition for a total of ten nations. Two players, Les Poidevin and Wimbledon champion Anthony Wilding were nominated for Australasia but through administrative bungling they were not entered. 50 players from 10 nations competed.  Austria (3)  Bohemia (4)  Canada (3)  France (1)  Germany (5)  Great Britain (22)  Hungary (3)  Netherlands (2)  South Africa (3)  Sweden (4) Jeu de paume at the 1908 Summer Olympics (real tennis) "Tennis at the 1908 London Summer Games". sports-reference.com.
