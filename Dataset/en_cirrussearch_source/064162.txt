Taurus Tremani Bartlett (born January 6, 1999), known professionally as Polo G, is an American rapper. He rose to prominence with his singles "Finer Things" and "Pop Out" (featuring Lil Tjay). His debut album Die a Legend (2019) peaked at number six on the US Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the RIAA. Bartlett's second studio album, The Goat (2020), peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and contained ten songs which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. His third studio album, Hall of Fame (2021), was met with continued success as it became Bartlett's first chart-topping album, also spawning his first number-one single, "Rapstar". Taurus Tremani Bartlett was born on January 6, 1999, and raised in the Marshall Field Garden Apartments, located in the Old Town neighborhood on the north side of Chicago, Illinois, to Taurus Bartlett and Stacia Mac. Mac, a former property manager, serves as Bartlett's manager. He is the second of four children, having an older sister, a younger brother, Taurean, who's also a rapper under the stage name Trench Baby, and a younger sister. After graduating high school, Bartlett was accepted to Lincoln University with a broadcasting major, but decided not to go on his first day, opting to pursue a music career full-time. He is affiliated with the Chicago-based gang Vice Lords, which is known to feud with gangs like the Gangster Disciples. Bartlett's first song ever recorded was titled "ODA", which he released to YouTube. Upon creating a SoundCloud account in 2018, he released the track "Gang with Me", which quickly racked up millions of plays. He continued gaining traction with his songs "Welcome Back" and "Neva Cared". Bartlett went on to release "Finer Things", a song he wrote while incarcerated, in the latter half of 2018 and quickly gained millions of views. In early 2019, Bartlett released "Pop Out" featuring Lil Tjay which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song's music video gained over 200 million views on YouTube and led to him signing a record deal with Columbia Records. Bartlett also released videos for his songs "Deep Wounds", "Through da Storm", "Effortless", and "Dyin' Breed" from his debut studio album Die a Legend, which was released on June 7, 2019, and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200. "Heartless", a single released later in 2019, featured production from Mustard, and was later featured on his second album. On February 14, 2020, Bartlett released the track "Go Stupid", with rappers Stunna 4 Vegas and NLE Choppa with featured production from Mike Will Made It and co-production from Tay Keith. "Go Stupid" became his second song on the Hot 100 (after "Pop Out"), peaking at number 60. Bartlett then released his second studio album, The Goat, on May 15, 2020. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and ten songs from the album hit the Hot 100, including "Flex" featuring Juice Wrld and "Be Something" featuring Lil Baby, peaking at numbers 30 and 57, respectively.

He released the album's fourth single "Gang Gang" with Lil Wayne on May 21, with the song peaking at 33 on the Hot 100. On June 11, Bartlett released Hall of Fame, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and became his first number-one album, selling 143,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. He released Hall of Fame 2.0, a deluxe edition of the album, on December 3, 2021. The album featured fourteen new songs in addition to the previous twenty, and contained guest appearances from Lil Baby, Moneybagg Yo, YungLiV, NLE Choppa, and Lil Tjay. On July 15, 2021, Bartlett participated at the remix of the song "Lurkin", as a tribute to his friend and late Chicago rapper King Von, to whom the song originally belonged together with Funk Flex. On June 3, 2022, Bartlett released "Distraction", the presumed lead single to his next album. It was accompanied by a music video directed by Christian Breslauer which was released the same day. "Distraction" peaked at number 66 on the Billboard 200 chart. Bartlett released a variety of singles throughout late 2022 and early 2023, including "Bag Talk", "My All" (including a music video that released on the Lyrical Lemonade YouTube channel), and "No Time Wasted" featuring American Rapper Future. On March 31, he was featured on the single "Grown Man" by American DJ Marshmello alongside Atlanta-based producer Southside.

On July 14, he was featured on both the posthumous King Von Album Grandson on the song "Phil Jackson," as well as on the song "Beat The Odds Part 2" on Lil Tjay's album 222. On July 21, he was featured on the country song "Heartbroken" by Diplo alongside country singer Jessie Murph, which peaked at 64 on the Billboard Hot 100. On August 11, Bartlett became the first and only rapper to have all of his albums certified double-platinum. On August 15, 2023, Bartlett officially announced his next album, Hood Poet (Stylized as H.O.O.D P.O.E.T., an acronym for "He Overcame Obstacles During Pain or Emotional Trauma)." He announced a new single titled "Barely Holdin' On" for release the following Friday, with the album to release on September 15, 2023. However, the album was delayed after Bartlett and his brother, who raps under the name "Trench Baby," were arrested on kidnapping, armed robbery, and assault charges. Trench Baby was later charged in a separate drive-by murder case. The album is now expected in August 2024, with this date initially being listed on Apple Music and seemingly confirmed by Bartlett in a TMZ interview in January 2024. On February 16, 2024, Bartlett released the single "Sorrys & Ferraris". Polo G has been associated with the Chicago drill sound, characterized with a melodic style. He often raps over piano-driven beats, which he claims he has perfected the use of. He has been noted for his "vivid and explicit storytelling"; his lyrics often involve tough subjects, including racism and mental health. He has stated that American rappers Lil Wayne and Tupac Shakur are his biggest influences. He also grew up listening to Gucci Mane, as well as Chicago rappers Lil Durk and G Herbo. Bartlett has a son, born on July 6, 2019. Bartlett was hospitalized on August 12, 2019, due to a near-fatal drug overdose at a party. Due to his aforementioned hospitalization and the death of fellow rapper and friend Juice Wrld, he has since quit Ecstasy and Xanax. His brother Tauren Bartlett uses the stage name Trench Baby; Trench Baby would later be charged with murder in November 2023. On June 11, 2021, Bartlett and his 16-year-old brother were arrested by officers from the Miami Police Department leaving Bartlett's album release party and Bartlett charged with 2 felonies: Battery of an officer and Threatening a public servant and 3 misdemeanors: Criminal mischief, Resisting arrest, Resisting an officer without violence. According to police, the vehicle was stopped due to having "dark tinted windows". Barlett initially refused to exit the vehicle and called his mother on FaceTime. According to USA Today, in the arrest report, officers stated that they ordered everyone to exit the vehicle to be searched for firearms after a passenger stated that the vehicle was bulletproof. Police stated that Bartlett struggled with the officer attempting to handcuff him, striking him. In July 2022, TMZ obtained police body cam footage of an irate Barlett in custody berating the arresting officers. Barlett is also seen receiving medical treatment and alleges that he passed out after hours in the back of the hot police car in which the police department disputed that it had occurred. Bartlett received criticism in the media for his behavior shown in the video with Bartlett's attorney, Bradford Cohen stating that the video was "heavily redacted" to make Barlett look bad. In a cell phone video that has since been released to the public, upon his mother's arrival, officers refused to give her any information and she stated that she was told that "in Miami, that we would be arrested if I asked what was going on with my minor son or any of my children." She went on to state that she felt "powerless" and later clarify that Bartlett and his brother were passengers in licensed car service driven by hired professional driver and had security personnel with them. Neither Bartlett nor his brother were driving nor owned the vehicle. On November 15, 2021, police dropped the two felony charges and the misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief citing insufficient evidence. Prosecutors agreed to drop the remaining charges if Bartlett attended an anger management program. It was reported on April 9, 2022, that Bartlett did not plead guilty to any wrongdoing but did complete the program and the remaining charges were dropped. On August 23, 2023, Bartlett and his brother were arrested in connection with a robbery. The two brothers were among four robbery suspects arrested at Bartlett's mansion. The arrests came after police searched Bartlett's mansion and car. An illegal short-barreled rifle would be among the items found during the police search, which led to an additional charge against Bartlett. Following the LAPD robbery and illegal firearm possession-related arrest, the brothers were then arrested again by the Burbank Police Department and booked on kidnapping, robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon charges related to a separate incident which occurred in April 2023. The brothers were released after they each posted $100,000 bail.
