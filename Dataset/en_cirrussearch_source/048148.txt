The Igelström family is a Swedish noble family from Nylödöse, which also belonged to the Russian and German nobility. The earliest reference dates back to 1529, with Bengt Haraldsson being the oldest of known ancestors. The Igelström family originated thanks to Harald Bengtsson (1604–1678) in 1645 and was registered in the List of Swedish noble families in 1647. The successors of Igelstrom owned estates in Livonia and in Estonia, in 1739 five brothers Igelstrom received the noble titles of barons in Poland, and in 1792 in Germany and in Russia. The name was registered in several of the House of Nobility in the Baltic states and Germany under spelling Igelstrom or von Igelström. Simon, lived 1350–1370. Squire.
