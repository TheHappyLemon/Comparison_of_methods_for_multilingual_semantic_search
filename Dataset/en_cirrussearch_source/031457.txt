The 2014–15 Serie A (known as the Serie A TIM for sponsorship reasons) was the 113th season of top-tier Italian football, the 83rd in a round-robin tournament, and the fifth since its organization under a league committee separate from Serie B. It began on 30 August 2014. A total of 20 teams competed in the league: 17 sides from the 2013–14 season and three promoted from the 2013–14 Serie B campaign. Juventus were the defending champions, successfully defending their title for the fourth consecutive time. On 2 May 2015, Juventus won the Scudetto for the fourth consecutive time. The season will feature the return of Palermo after only one season in the second division and Empoli, whose last appearance was in the 2007–08 season. Cesena, the play-off winner, returned to the top level after two years in Serie B. The pre-season saw two ownership changes: Cagliari was sold from Massimo Cellino to Milanese entrepreneur Tommaso Giulini, a former board member at Internazionale. Sampdoria was sold by Edoardo Garrone (son of the late Riccardo Garrone) to Rome-based film businessman Massimo Ferrero. The season was also influenced by serious financial problems surrounding Parma, involving two controversial takeovers during the season, its last chairman Giampietro Manenti being arrested on 18 March 2015 under accusation of money laundering, and the club being ultimately declared insolvent by the local court on the very next day. The Serie A this season had the most goals on average than any of the five other top leagues in Europe.

Rules for classification: 1) points; 2) head-to-head points; 3) head-to-head goal difference; 4) goal difference; 5) number of goals scored; 6) draw. (Head-to-head record is applied for clubs with the same number of points only once all matches between said clubs have been played.). (C) Champions; (L) Liquidated after the season due to bankruptcy.; (R) Relegated Notes: Since the winners of the 2014–15 Coppa Italia (Juventus) qualified for European competition based on league position, the spot awarded to the cup winners (Europa League group stage) was passed to the fifth-placed team and the spot originally meant for the fifth-placed team (Europa League third qualifying round) was given to the highest placed team that has obtained an UEFA license and not already qualified for European competition. Genoa failed to obtain a UEFA license from Italian Football Federation. Therefore, they were barred to participate in European competitions. Genoa appealed the decision, but the appeal was denied. Palermo finished ahead of Sassuolo on head-to-head away goals scored: Palermo 2-1 Sassuolo, Sassuolo 0-0 Palermo. Parma was docked 7 points for failing to pay over players' wages. Later the club announced bankruptcy, and it was recreated without professional status. The table lists the positions of teams after each week of matches. In order to preserve chronological evolvements, any postponed matches were not included to the round at which they were originally scheduled, but added to the full round they were played immediately afterwards. For example, if a match was scheduled for matchday 29 (Fiorentina vs Sampdoria), but then postponed and played between matchdays 30 and 31, it was added to the standings for matchday 30.
