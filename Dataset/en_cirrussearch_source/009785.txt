The Croatia women's national basketball team is the national representative for Croatia in international women's basketball competition. The team is controlled by the Croatian Basketball Federation (Hrvatski košarkaški savez). Prior to 1992 the Croatia women's national basketball team competed as a part of the Yugoslavia women's national basketball team. The lone competition the Croatia women's national team have never qualified for is the FIBA Women's World Cup. Croatia is the most successful women's basketball team at the Mediterranean Games. At the 2013 Mediterranean Games the women's basketball tournament was cancelled because too few teams applied for the competition which was mainly due to coinciding dates with EuroBasket 2013.
