Clube Desportivo das Aves (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈkluβɨ ðɨʃpuɾˈtivu ðɐz ˈavɨʃ]), commonly known as Desportivo das Aves, or simply as Aves, is a Portuguese football club based in Vila das Aves, Santo Tirso. The club was founded on 12 November 1930 and plays at the Estádio do Clube Desportivo das Aves, which holds a seating capacity of 8,560. As a sports club, it has football schools for junior players and two futsal teams for both men and women, as well as a football trial system to help younger players come through the academy. The club's official supporters' group was the Força Avense. Aves have spent most of their history in the lower leagues, having their debut Primeira Liga season in 1985–86 after winning consecutively the second and third divisions. They returned to the top flight for 2000–01 and 2006–07, again for one season each. Aves won promotion from LigaPro in 2016–17, finishing as runners-up to Portimonense S.C. under the management of José Mota. On 20 May 2018, the club defeated Sporting CP 2–1 and won their first Taça de Portugal. However, Aves did not qualify for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage because they failed to obtain a license for European competitions. The team were relegated in 2019–20, with five games to play, were marred by financial problems. For these reasons, they and Vitória F.C. were given a further relegation to the third tier. On 23 September 2020, Aves withdrew before the start of the season. Due to unpaid debts to other clubs, the club received a transfer ban from FIFA, which it sidestepped by founding new entity Clube Desportivo das Aves 1930 in October. Desportivo das Aves played at the Estádio do Clube Desportivo das Aves in Vila das Aves, Santo Tirso, holding a seating capacity of 8,560. The stadium also plays host to the reserve side's home games. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1981. It underwent many renovations during the new millennium, especially in 2000, when Desportivo das Aves gained promotion to the Primeira Liga for the second time in their history. When the stadium was built, there were 12,500 seats available, but it currently seats only 8,560 after the club decided to remove chairs.
