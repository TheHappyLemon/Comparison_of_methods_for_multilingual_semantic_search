Er (Р р; italics: Р р) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the alveolar trill /r/, like the "rolled" sound in the Scottish pronunciation of ⟨r⟩ in "curd". The Cyrillic letter Er was derived from the Greek letter Rho (Ρ ρ). It has no connection to the Latin letter P (P p), which evolved from the Greek letter Pi (Π π), despite both having the same form.
