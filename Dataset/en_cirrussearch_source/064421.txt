Al-Rayyan (Arabic: الريان) is a city in the similarly named municipality of Al Rayyan, in Qatar. The city and its suburbs comprise the largest population center in Qatar outside of Doha proper, immediately to its east. Consisting of all of the districts in the municipality's easternmost section, its western boundary is roughly where the Al Majd Highway runs through the municipality. It is considered a part of the metropolitan Doha area. The city was one of the venues for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The city's name derives from the Arabic word "ray", which translates to "irrigation". It was given this name due to its low elevation, allowing it to act as a flood plain during the rainy season and provide a prolonged supply of water to the numerous wild plants and crops that grew in the area. Before the massive expansion of Al Rayyan City, the two main areas in Al Rayyan were Old Al Rayyan and New Al Rayyan. Old Al Rayyan consisted of many traditional villages, while New Al Rayyan contained many large villas occupied by members of Qatar's ruling family. As Al Rayyan City grew, all of the municipality's eastern settlements were incorporated as districts in the city. Two main areas define the city's historical center: Old Al Rayyan (Arabic: الريان القديم; translit. Al Rayyan Al Qadeem') in the northern section, and New Al Rayyan (Arabic: الريان الجديد; translit. Al Rayyan Al Jadeed) in the south. As for the city proper, several districts of Al Rayyan City are designated by the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, including: Abu Hamour Al Aziziya Al Gharrafa Al Luqta Al Waab Al Wajbah Gharrafat Al Rayyan Muraikh Luaib Mehairja Baaya Muaither When free elections of the Central Municipal Council first took place in Qatar during 1999, Al Rayyan City was divided into two constituencies: no. 18, which had New Al Rayyan as its seat, and no. 19, which had Old Al Rayyan as its seat. These two constituencies would remain independent of each other for the next three consecutive elections until the fifth municipal elections in 2015, when they were merged under constituency no. 14, with New Al Rayyan as the seat. Also included in its constituency is Al Luqta, Lebday, and Al Shagub. In the inaugural municipal elections in 1999, voter turnout was 78.3% in constituency no. 18 where Mohammed Hamoud Al Shafi was elected, receiving 37.9%, or 256 votes. In constituency no. 19, Mohammed Saleh Al-Marri won, receiving 66%, or 264 votes. Voter turnout was low, at 37.7% At the next elections, held in 2002, Al Shafi retained his seat in constituency no. 19 while Faraj Saeed Al Aweer was elected in no. 18. In the next election in 2007, Al Shafi once again retained his post in constituency no. 19 whereas Hamad Hamad Al Haoul won the elections in no. 18. The 2011 elections saw both Al Shafi and Haoul retain their seats in their respective constituencies. For the 2015 elections, after the two constituencies were merged into one, long-time representative of constituency no. 19 Mohammed Hamoud Al Shafi emerged as the election winner. Khalifa International Stadium, one of the first large-scale stadiums in Qatar, was built in Al Rayyan City in 1976. It was later incorporated in the Aspire Zone. The Aspire Zone is located in the Al Waab district and accommodates Aspire Academy. Also found within the Al Waab area are Villaggio Mall and Doha Zoo. Education City, Qatar Science & Technology Park and other Qatar Foundation facilities are located in the Al Gharrafa, Gharrafat Al Rayyan and Al Shagub districts of Al Rayyan. The Municipal Headquarters is based out of the Old Al Rayyan district, as is the Al Rayyan Security Department and the Al Rayyan Pediatric Emergency Center. On 4 October, 1982, the Al Rayyan Public Library was officially inaugurated in Old Al Rayyan by the Minister of Education, Mohammed bin Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani. In the New Al Rayyan district, the Qatar Equestrian Federation (QEF) maintains its stables and outdoor arena. Founded in 1975 and boasting a spectator capacity of 1,500, the QEF arena is considered to be the country's main horse racing venue. The New Al Rayyan Park was opened in 2004 in a residential zone on Al Atouriya Street. Covering an area of 8,827 m², facilities in the park include a children's play area and a cafeteria while plants featured include date palms and plants from the genera melia and jatropha. Education City Stadium, a 2022 FIFA World Cup venue, has been built in the city. It has a seating capacity of 40,000 spectators and has built in solar panels on its roof. It hosted 8 games of the 2022 FIFA World Cup and was opened on 15 June 2020. Ahmad bin Ali Stadium and Khalifa International Stadium have been rebuilt in the city to the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
