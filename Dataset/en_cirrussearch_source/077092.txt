The 2008 NHL Entry Draft was the 46th NHL Entry Draft. It was hosted by the Ottawa Senators at Scotiabank Place in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, on June 20–21, 2008. The Senators were originally awarded the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, but because of the lockout, that draft was scaled back significantly from its usual format of being open to the public and having many draft-eligible players in attendance. The actual 2005 drafting was held in Ottawa's Westin Hotel instead of the Corel Centre, as Canadian Tire Centre was then known. As a result of 2005's abridged draft, Ottawa was compensated with the 2008 draft. The draft was part of a festival of events that Ottawa and the NHL presented at the Scotiabank Place arena. Before the first round and during the later rounds, the patio outside the main doors was the site of the 'Senators Fan Fest', with hockey games and music. Indoors, the NHL presented an exhibit of NHL trophies, including the Stanley Cup. A hockey card and memorabilia sale was also held. The 2008 draft lottery was held April 7. The Tampa Bay Lightning retained the first overall selection. There were no changes from the reverse order of finish of the 2007–08 NHL season. Source: NHL Central Scouting Bureau staff.
