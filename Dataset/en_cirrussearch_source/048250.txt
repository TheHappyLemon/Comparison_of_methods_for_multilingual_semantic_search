Viktor Baranov, the sole Russian diver, did not finish the competition in the first round of the plain high diving event. Rankings given are within the diver's heat. Dressage Jumping (Team score is the sum of the top three individual scores.) Twenty-four fencers represented Russia. It was the second appearance of the nation in fencing, which had previously competed in 1900.

Klein was able to match Russia's best performance from 1908, taking the silver medal in the middleweight class. The team went a combined 17–22. The bout between Klein and Asikainen turned out to be the last match, which lasted 11 hours and forty minutes, which is the world's longest wrestling match. After Klein finally claimed victory, he was completely exhausted and was ruled unfit to compete in the final. Thus Johanson, whose only loss in the elimination rounds had been via a double loss to Asikainen, became the gold medalist. "Russia at the 1912 Stockholm Summer Games". sports-reference.com.
