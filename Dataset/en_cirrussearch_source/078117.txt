.ag is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Antigua and Barbuda. Registrations can be made at the second level directly beneath .ag, or at the third level beneath: .com.ag or .co.ag (intended for commercial entities) .org.ag (intended for organisations, especially nonprofits) .net.ag (intended for network operators/providers) .nom.ag (intended for individuals) There are no restrictions on who can register. In addition to its original intended use as a country code, the .ag domain has been marketed for use for agriculture-related sites, and for sites referencing the atomic symbol for silver, Ag. It also has a potential use for other domain hacks for English words that end in -ag. The Heritage Foundation uses .ag for URL shortening (herit.ag). Aktiengesellschaft, abbreviated AG, is a German term that refers to a corporation that is limited by shares, i.e. owned by shareholders, and may be traded on a stock market. The term is used in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, but not Liechtenstein or Luxembourg. A German court (5. Zivilsenat des Oberlandesgerichtes Hamburg) ruled in July 2004 that a .ag domain may only be registered by an Aktiengesellschaft, and then only by an AG that has the same name as the domain. For example, a company with shareholders in Germany having the name X AG may not register as y.ag. Sermitsiaq uses the TLD. Internet in Antigua and Barbuda "The Domain of Antigua & Barbuda". Dynadot.
