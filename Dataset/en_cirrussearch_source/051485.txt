Joonas Korpisalo (/ˌkɔːrpɪˈsɑːloʊ/; born 28 April 1994) is a Finnish professional ice hockey goaltender for the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously played for the Columbus Blue Jackets and briefly the Los Angeles Kings. Korpisalo played professionally in his native Finland in the SM-liiga during the 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons for Jokerit and Ilves respectively. Korpisalo was selected by the Blue Jackets in the third round (62nd overall) of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. On 21 March 2014, the Blue Jackets signed Korpisalo to a three-year, entry-level contract. During the latter half of the 2016–17 NHL season, Korpisalo took over as the Blue Jackets' backup goaltender behind Sergei Bobrovsky. On 9 June 2017, the Blue Jackets signed Korpisalo to a two-year contract extension. When Bobrovsky left to the Florida Panthers in free agency before the 2019–20 season, Korpisalo became the Blue Jackets' starting goaltender. However, after injuring his knee in a shootout loss to the Chicago Blackhawks on 29 December, rookie goaltender Elvis Merzļikins started in his absence. On 17 April 2020, Korpisalo signed a two-year contract extension worth $5.6 million to stay with the Blue Jackets. Korpisalo hung onto the starting job for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, and made his NHL playoff debut for the Blue Jackets on 2 August 2020. Korpisalo did not allow a goal against the Toronto Maple Leafs in a 2–0 victory, the first Blue Jackets goaltender to record a shutout in the playoffs. On 9 August 2020, Korpisalo would again shut out the Maple Leafs by a 3–0 score, eliminating them from the playoffs and securing a series win for the Blue Jackets. In Game 1 of the Blue Jackets' first-round series, Korpisalo set a modern NHL record for saves in a single game with 85, despite a 3–2 defeat in quintuple overtime versus the Tampa Bay Lightning. His performance surpassed the previous modern record of 73 by Kelly Hrudey in the Easter Epic 33 years prior, and was eight short of the all-time record of 92 set by Detroit Red Wings goaltender Normie Smith in the 1936 NHL playoffs. During the 2022–23 season, his ninth season within the Blue Jackets organization, Korpisalo was traded with Vladislav Gavrikov to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Jonathan Quick, a conditional first-round pick in 2023, and a third-round pick in 2024 on 1 March 2023. Acquired to assume the role as the Kings starting goaltender, Korpisalo had an impressive end to the regular season in collecting 7 wins through 11 appearances. In the post-season, Korpisalo was unable to help the Kings advance past the first round, losing in six games against the Edmonton Oilers. As a free agent at the conclusion of his contract with the Kings, Korpisalo was signed on the opening day of free agency to a five-year, $20 million contract with the Ottawa Senators on 1 July 2023. Joonas is the son of former Liiga forward Jari Korpisalo. "Blue Jackets sign Joonas Korpisalo". Columbus Blue Jackets. 21 March 2014. Retrieved 21 March 2014.
