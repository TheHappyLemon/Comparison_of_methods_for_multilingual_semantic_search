On 26 March 2024, he scored the winning goal of a 2–1 victory over Iceland in the qualifying play-off final to send Ukraine through to the official tournament. A technically gifted player, Mudryk is a right-footed winger who is most comfortable cutting in from the left onto his stronger foot. His acceleration is a particular strength, as he can reach his top speed extremely quickly from a standing start. This allows him to stand his opponent up before knocking the ball either way and darting away from them. He often does this down the touchline and onto his weaker foot – the direction in which his opponent won't expect him to go – before putting a cross into the box. His acceleration allows him to draw fouls from opponents who cannot snatch the ball from him. This tactic helps Mudryk move inside wide from the left, before combining with teammates in the centre of the pitch or working a shooting opportunity for himself, especially on the counter as he provides the perfect profile to successfully turn defence into attack. His abilities and skill set are held in high regard, and his speed and acceleration is of particular note, being one of the fastest players in the world. His dribbling is also a strong part of his game. The way he centres himself over the ball – using little outside-of-the-boot touches – keeps defenders retreating at a pace that he can dictate. He has the intelligence to drive in a direction that wins space for himself or teammates, the willingness to go inside or outside, and has more than enough pace to confidently drive through gaps. Mudryk often hugs the touchline and looks to drive at the opposition before cutting in or finding a midfielder or overlapping the fullback to release the ball. Mudryk usually keeps his distance from the fullback, meaning he can use his pace instead of strength to get past him and it works effectively and he often zooms away, leading an attack. Wesley Fofana, his team mate at Chelsea, said that Mudryk is faster than Kylian Mbappe and probably the fastest player he has played against. Ben Chilwell was cautious in his praise stating, "With Mudryk, I see endless bags of potential that hasn't been fulfilled yet". In reference to his poor on-field performances for Chelsea, some fans nicknamed him "Ukraine Bolt", suggesting that his pace is his only forte.
