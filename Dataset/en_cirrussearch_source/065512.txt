Formerly known as Tanjungbalai-Asahan, this area was once a district within Asahan Regency until it was granted city status in 1984. However, the identifier "Asahan" is still used to distinguish it from the port of the same name on Great Karimun island.

The table also includes the number of administrative villages in each district (all classed as urban kelurahan) and its post codes. The Port (which actually lies in Tanjungbalai District of Asahan Regency, between the city and the coast) has warehouse facilities and stacking fields. This port also carries out cargo and passenger services with activities mainly in exporting vegetables and fish to Malaysia. The port has passenger services to Port Klang and Port of Melintang Forest, Perak.
