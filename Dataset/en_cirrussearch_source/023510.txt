The Brabantse Pijl (English: Brabant Arrow, French: Flèche Brabançonne or Flèche Branconne) is a Flanders Classics road bicycle race held annually in Flemish Brabant and in Walloon Brabant, Belgium. The race was organised as a 1.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour from 2005 to 2009, a 1.HC event from 2010 to 2019, and since 2020 has been part of the UCI ProSeries. Zaventem used to be the city of start; in 2008 however, Leuven became the place of start. Until 2009, the finish was located in Alsemberg and, in 2010, it moved to Overijse. Also in 2010, the fixed date of the Brabantse Pijl shifted from the Sunday before the Tour of Flanders to the Wednesday before the Amstel Gold Race. In 2011, the race was upgraded to a 1.HC event. Edwig Van Hooydonck holds the record for most wins in the race with four between 1987 and 1995. Active riders are in italics Official website "Brabantse Pijl". FirstCycling.com. 2023.
