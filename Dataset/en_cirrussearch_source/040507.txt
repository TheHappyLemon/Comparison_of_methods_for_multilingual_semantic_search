The head of the government of France has been called the prime minister of France (French: Premier ministre) since 1959, when Michel Debré became the first officeholder appointed under the Fifth Republic. During earlier periods of history, the head of government of France was known by different titles. As was common in European democracies of the 1815–1958 period (the Bourbon Restoration and July Monarchy, the Second, Third, and Fourth Republic, as well as the Vichy regime), the head of government was called President of the Council of Ministers (Président du Conseil des ministres), generally shortened to President of the council (Président du Conseil). This should not be confused with the elected office of president of the French Republic, who appoints the prime minister as head of state. Under the Kingdom of France, there was no official title for the leader of the government. The chief ministers (principal ministres) of certain kings of France nonetheless led the government de facto. During the First Republic, the arrangements for governance changed frequently: National Convention (20 September 1792 – 2 November 1795) with Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve as President of the National Convention (22 September 1792 – 2 June 1793) with Maximilien Robespierre as President of the National Convention (4 June 1793 – 27 July 1794) with Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès as President of the National Convention (7 October 1794 – 20 April 1795) with Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès as President of the National Convention (20 April 1795 – 26 October 1795) Directory (2 November 1795 – 10 November 1799), with Paul Barras as President of the Directory Consulate (10 November 1799 – 18 May 1804), with Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul of France There was no individual head of government. As Emperor, Napoleon was both head of state and head of government. As Emperor, Napoleon was both head of state and head of government.
