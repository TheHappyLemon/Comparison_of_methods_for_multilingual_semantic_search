The Russian December 2021 ultimatum were a set of documents presented by Russia to the United States, NATO, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on 17 December 2021, during the prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The ultimatum outlined Russia's demands and expectations regarding the security situation in Europe, especially in relation to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the future expansion of NATO. The proposals were seen as an attempt by Russia to exert pressure and influence on the Western countries, and as a sign of its dissatisfaction and distrust with the existing security architecture in Europe. The ultimatum was soundly rejected, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine followed two months later. The proposals contained several controversial and provocative elements, such as: A legally binding guarantee that NATO would not admit any new members, especially Ukraine and Georgia, and that it would not deploy any additional troops or weapons in the existing member states. A revision of the 1997 NATO–Russia Founding Act, which regulates the military activities and cooperation between NATO and Russia, and a withdrawal of NATO's infrastructure and capabilities from the territories that were not part of NATO as of 1997. A moratorium on the deployment of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles in Europe, and a dialogue on strategic stability and arms control. A reform of the OSCE to make it more representative, inclusive, and effective in addressing the security challenges and conflicts in Europe. The proposals were met with skepticism and rejection by the US, NATO, and the OSCE, who viewed them as unrealistic, unacceptable, and incompatible with the principles and values of Euro-Atlantic security. They also expressed concern about Russia's continued military buildup near Ukraine's border, which they regarded as a threat of aggression and intimidation. They reaffirmed their support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and their commitment to dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the crisis peacefully. They also stressed their readiness to defend themselves and their allies against any potential attack by Russia.
