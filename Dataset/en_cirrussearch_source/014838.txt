Identity is the only album by Zee, a short-lived side project of Pink Floyd keyboardist Rick Wright, a duo partnership consisting of Wright and Dave Harris of New Romantic outfit Fashion, released in 1984. Wright later stated that he felt Identity was an "experimental mistake" that should never have been released. The album was written and produced by Wright and Harris and all the lyrics were penned by Harris. The album makes heavy use of the Fairlight CMI, a musical synthesizer popularized in the 1980s. This creates a very electronic sound that persists through every track. "Confusion" was released as a single with "Eyes of a Gypsy" as the B-side. In 2019, the album was reissued with bonus tracks and a new cover art. All lyrics are written by Dave Harris; all music is composed by Richard Wright and Dave Harris "Confusion" (Single Mix) – 3:36 "Confusion" (12" Mix) – 6:21 "Eyes of a Gypsy" (Dub) (from the "Confusion" 12" UK single) – 4:11 Richard Wright: keyboards, synthesized percussion, Fairlight, backing vocals Dave "Dee" Harris: guitars, keyboards, percussion, Fairlight, lead vocals Produced by Richard Wright and Dave Harris Engineered and co-produced by Tim Palmer Overdubs and mixdown by Utopia (London) Artwork by Dave Harris Photography by Paul Cox "Jerk Music Critic review".
