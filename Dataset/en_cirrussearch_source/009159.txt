In 2014, following Russia's annexation of Crimea and during his stay in Ukraine, Lazarev stated to Ukrainian television, "Maybe my own Russian fans will throw tomatoes at me, but this is the way it is for me. When I travel to Yalta, for me it's Ukraine." However, in his later comments on Ukrainian television the singer said that his words had been taken out of context. Lazarev explained that in fact he meant that the territorial change was so instant that he could not get used to the idea that Crimea was part of Russia again and "need[ed] time to realize it"; the singer compared it to the feeling of those who remember the transfer of Crimea from Russia to Ukraine in 1954: "I perfectly understand those who, in 1954, suddenly woke up in Ukraine, and who wanted Crimea to return to Russia. I know, many are happy with that. But I need time to realize that". Lazarev claimed the recording of his speech was shortened and edited by the Ukrainian TV crew for use in an "anti-Russian" an information war. In February 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, Lazarev spoke out against the invasion and war. “Please everyone, stop! Together, say STOP! Have a seat at the table of negotiations! Let the people live!!! No one supports the war! I want my children to live in peace! I WANT to live and create IN A PEACEFUL TIME!" In January 2023, Ukraine included Lazarev on a decision "to impose personal economic sanctions against some Russian cultural and sports figures" due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In December 2016, he announced that he has a two-year-old son, Nikita, after pictures of both attending church were captured by paparazzi. Nikita was later featured in Lazarev's music video for "Так красиво" in 2017. In September 2019, during an interview with Lera Kudryavtseva, Sergey disclosed having a one-year-old daughter, Anya, with the same biological mother as Nikita but born from a different surrogate mother. This was also the first confirmation of Nikita having been born via surrogate.
