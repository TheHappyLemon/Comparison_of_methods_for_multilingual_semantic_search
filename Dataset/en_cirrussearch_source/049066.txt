The 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the 15th edition of the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the biennial international men's soccer championship of the North, Central American, and Caribbean region organized by CONCACAF. The tournament was primarily hosted in the United States, with Costa Rica and Jamaica hosting double-headers in the first round of matches in groups B and C, respectively. The United States were the defending champions, having won the 2017 tournament. With the abolition of the FIFA Confederations Cup, the CONCACAF Cup was annulled and the Gold Cup did not qualify the winner to a major tournament for the first time since 2009. In February 2018, CONCACAF announced that the tournament would expand to 16 teams from 12. Mexico won their eighth Gold Cup title (their eleventh CONCACAF championship) with their 1–0 victory over the United States in the final. In May 2018, CONCACAF confirmed that matches would be held in Central America and the Caribbean in addition to the United States. This was the first time that the Gold Cup was held in the Caribbean, with all previous matches having taken place in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. In May 2018, CONCACAF announced the fifteen venues in the United States which would host matches. Soldier Field in Chicago was announced on September 27, 2018, as the venue of the final. On November 26, 2018, CONCACAF announced that Costa Rica would host a double-header in the first round of matches of Group B on June 16, 2019, taking place at the Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica in San José. On April 2, 2019, CONCACAF announced that Jamaica would host a double-header in the first round of matches of Group C on June 17, 2019, taking place at the Independence Park in Kingston. The qualification system was changed and no longer divided into Central American and Caribbean zones. Among the 16 teams, six qualified directly after participating in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying Hexagonal, while the other 10 teams qualified through the 2019–20 CONCACAF Nations League qualifying. Bermuda and Guyana made their Gold Cup debuts. Hex indicates 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying Hexagonal, CNLQ indicates 2019–20 CONCACAF Nations League qualifying.

Each team had to submit a list of 23 players (three players had to be goalkeepers). On August 31, 2018, CONCACAF announced that the top four teams of the September 2018 CONCACAF Ranking Index were seeded for the group stage of the tournament: The groups and full match schedule were revealed on April 10, 2019, 18:00 EDT (15:00 local time, PDT), in Los Angeles, California, United States.
