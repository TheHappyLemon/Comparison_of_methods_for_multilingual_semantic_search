Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is a 2013 American animated science fiction comedy film produced by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation, animated by Sony Pictures Imageworks, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The sequel to the 2009 film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, the film was directed by Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn (in their feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay written by Erica Rivinoja and the writing team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the directors of the previous film, returned as executive producers, and also conceived the story with Rivinoja. Bill Hader, Anna Faris, James Caan, Andy Samberg, Neil Patrick Harris, and Benjamin Bratt reprise their roles from the first film, while Will Forte, who voiced Joseph Towne in the first film, voices Chester V in this film. New cast members include Kristen Schaal as Chester's orangutan assistant, Barb, and Terry Crews as Earl Devereaux, replacing Mr. T. The film's plot focuses on Flint Lockwood and his friends returning to Swallow Falls to save the world after the presumed-destroyed Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator (FLDSMDFR) reactivates, this time creating sentient food creatures. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 was released in the United States on September 27, 2013, and was a box office success, grossing $274.3 million worldwide against its budget of $78 million, $31 million more than its predecessor, which grossed only $243 million. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, though it was deemed inferior to its predecessor. After scientist Flint Lockwood saved his island Chewandswallow from his invention, the "Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator" (aka the FLDSMDFR), Chester V, the CEO of "Live Corp" and Flint's childhood idol, offers his company's services to help clean the food off the island while he evacuates the residents. Chester hires Flint, but during his short tenure at Live Corp, Flint enters a competition for a promotion, only to publicly humiliate himself by accident via an invention of his called the "Celebrationator", which prematurely goes off when he does not win. Later on, Chester informs Flint that the FLDSMDFR is still functioning and is creating sentient food creatures known as foodimals, one of which attacked his employees stationed on Swallow Falls. Chester tells Flint that he needs to travel alone to the island, find the FLDSMDFR, and insert a USB flash drive-like device known as the "BS-USB" to shut it down. However, Flint takes his pet monkey Steve, his meteorologist girlfriend Sam Sparks, her cameraman Manny, police officer Earl Devereaux, and Flint’s former bully turned ally Brent McHale. Flint also grudgingly accepts the help of Tim, his widowed father, who takes them to the island using his fishing boat. When Chester learns that Flint is not alone, he and his much-abused orangutan assistant Barb gather some of their employees and follow. While Tim stays on the boat and makes friends with some living pickles, Flint and his friends work their way through the jungle-like environment of food that now completely covers the island. They encounter many (“food-animals”) “Foodimals”, including a living strawberry Sam names "Barry". A spider-like cheeseburger (“CheeseSpider”) is revealed to be what attacked Chester's employees and it chases Flint and the gang, but they are saved by the arrival of Chester, who joins the mission. Sam is immediately suspicious of Chester’s motives as well as Barb’s dismissal of her scientific credentials. As they press on, she starts noticing the Foodimals aren’t all hostile, instead simply living creatures with families to protect. Sam eventually reveals her discovery to Flint and tries to make him see Chester’s selfish motivations but, desperate to impress his hero, Flint unintentionally disrespects his friends and they leave him, heartbroken. Heading back to the boat, Sam and the others come across the CheeseSpider again, but Sam proves her point by befriending it and it reveals its playful nature. The friends discover the only reason it was hostile before was because they were wearing LiveCorp vests, having realised the sinister nature of the company. Manny reveals the "live" part of its name is actually "evil" spelled backwards. They are then captured by Chester's employees before they can attempt to go back and warn Flint. Flint, Chester, and Barb track down the FLDSMDFR, but after meeting and befriending some harmless living marshmallows it created, Flint realises Sam was right, defies Chester and refuses to use the BS-USB. However, Chester then inserts the device into the machine himself, revealing it to actually be a hacking device designed to reprogram it. With the FLDSMDFR now under his control, Chester knocks Flint down into a chasm and starts capturing Foodimals, intent on using them as the key ingredients for Live Corp's upcoming line of food bars. The marshmallows rescue Flint and reunite him with Tim. The duo realizes that, without the FLDSMDFR, the existing Foodimals and the ecosystem will die out. As Flint offers his condolences, he is surprised to discover that the Foodimals, having watched archive footage of him creating the FLDSMDFR, revere him as their creator. Inspired, Flint vows to rescue his friends, save the island, and stop Chester once and for all. Tim and the Foodimals catapult Flint and Barry into Live Corp’s base. Some captive Foodimals are freed by Barry, and they help fight off the company's employees. Flint confronts Chester, who threatens to turn his friends into food bars as well. When Barb begins to show reluctance, Chester dismisses her and battles Flint alone but Flint comes up with a plan to defeat Chester once and for all by luring Chester into a death trap, using his "Party in a Box" invention to beat him and free his friends. Chester attempts to escape with the FLDSMDFR, and is pursued by the Foodimals and Flint's group. Flint then orders a redeemed Barb to distract Chester, which she does so by turning him on for his abuse and stealing the machine back, giving Flint, his friends, and the Foodimals more time to summon the CheeseSpider, which eats Chester alive. When the plan works, Barb hands the FLDSMDFR to Flint, who returns it to where it was found, thus restoring the island’s ecosystem and reconciling with his friends. The residents of Swallow Falls return to their proper homes, adapting to the altered ecosystem and happily continuing their lives, while Flint is hailed a hero for saving the island and stopping Chester. Bill Hader as Flint Lockwood: an inventor and Sam's boyfriend. Hader also voices the FLDSMDFR, as he did in the first film. Bridget Hoffman as the young Flint. She replaces Max Neuwirth for the role.

Neil Patrick Harris as Steve: Flint's pet vervet monkey who communicates using a thought translator Flint invented; however, he only has a limited vocabulary and mostly just says his name, says a few random things, and reminds Flint that he's hungry. He later becomes Barb's love interest. Benjamin Bratt as Manny: Sam's Guatemalan cameraman and a former doctor, pilot, and comedian. Terry Crews as Earl Devereaux: the town's athletic police officer. He was originally voiced by Mr. T in the first film. Kristen Schaal as Barb: An intelligent orangutan and Chester's assistant. She later develops a crush on Steve.

In December 2011, it was reported that Cody Cameron, one of the story artists on the first film, and Kris Pearn, the head of story on the first, would direct the sequel, with Lord and Miller serving as executive producers.

In promotional events before the film's release, Sony Pictures Animation partnered with some produce companies to provide more than 200,000 pounds (91 tonnes) of produce for Feeding America's action to help children and families in need. Several food-packing events across the country were organized, with Anna Faris and Will Forte attending the main one in Los Angeles. Sony teamed up with marketing partners in the United States to promote the film through Subway Kids Meals with a set of 6 customized bags.

The site's consensus reads: "While not as clever or inventive as its predecessor, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 compensates with enough dazzling visuals to keep younger viewers entertained." Metacritic, gave the film a score of 59 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade "A−", the same as the first film. Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, saying "While not as delightfully breezy as the original, an engaging voice cast and hordes of 'Foodimals' still manage to serve up a tasty sequel." Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star called it "fun, even if it is occasionally so chaotic it tramples the movie's flow like a herd of stampeding Buffaloafs." Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune thought it "better in every respect than the original film. It's also more fun than all three Ice Age, Monsters University, Planes, Epic, Despicable Me 2, and though I could go on, I won't." Jordan Hoffman of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars, saying "Cloudy 2 is loud, weird and chaotic—just as kids like it. ... sometimes it's good to have a sugary treat." Dave McGinn of The Globe and Mail felt it "promises more fun and laughs than it delivers, and this meal tastes like too many that have gone before it." Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic reviewed it as "the rare sequel that takes the spirit of the original and runs with it, coming up with something uniquely good in its own right." In a lukewarm review, Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph said "For all its properly surreal mayhem, this flick isn't quite as nimble or emotionally rounded as its predecessor." Sean O'Connell of The Washington Post wrote "Kids will chuckle, for sure. But parents who were pleasantly surprised by the original film's intelligence will miss Lord and Miller's guiding hands, as what once felt so funny now leaves a stale taste." Rafer Guzman of Newsday thought it "relies on the usual noxious recipe for junky kid flicks: loud noise, pop music and poop jokes." Miriam Bale of The New York Times felt it was "sometimes so strange, colorful and wildly cute that it may end up becoming a Yellow Submarine for a new generation." Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film two out of four stars, saying "It's another brightly rendered effort, but, as the title indicates, a lot of the real creativity seems to have been used up the first time around." Mike Clark of USA Today gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "There's not a surprise or moment of tension to be found here, but the film is all energy and color that makes the discomfort of 3-D glasses seem worth it." Jocelyn Noveck of the Associated Press thought the film worked for its audience: "this is a kid movie, and KIDS LOVE PUNS. So they laugh at 'There's a leek in the boat.' And they laugh even more the second time." A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a C, saying "Like too many sequels, this second helping of Meatballs confuses bigger for better, piling on the action but misplacing much of the original's charm." David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three out of four stars, saying "This scrumptious sequel follows the same recipe as the 2009 original." Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle called it "a humorous yet unfocused romp, so unwilling to settle on a single theme that hyperactivity medication should be handed out with the 3-D glasses." Matt Patches of Film.com wrote, "The 2009 original separated itself from the Pixar and Dreamworks competition with a joke-first approach. The sequel quadruples the recipe, with gags on top of gags on top of gags in a way only animation could achieve. Like a foodie Jurassic Park conjured up by Tex Avery, Cloudy 2 is a sight to behold … as long as your brain hasn't turned to mush by the halfway point." Amy Nicholson of The Village Voice compared the franchise to "The Muppets and Pee Wee's Playhouse, kids' shows that ripen as their audience matures." Keith Staskiewicz of Entertainment Weekly called it "charming enough." Steve Davis of The Austin Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars, saying "For both kids and adults, CWCM2 is little more than a vague memory as soon as it's over." Peter Debruge of Variety opined, "the pic's zany tone and manic pace are good for a quick-hit sugar high." Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying "Honestly, anyone who can pull off a running joke about leeks that does not make you gag, and is in fact a silly delight, deserves props." Bill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, "Unlike so many sequels, this fun-filled 3D adventure is sure to entertain younger kids but also charm the adults".
