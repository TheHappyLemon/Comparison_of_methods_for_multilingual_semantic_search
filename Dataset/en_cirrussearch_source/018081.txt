He has twice won promotion to the Premier League, with Queens Park Rangers and Reading. Born in Riga, Gorkšs began his career at FK Auda, scoring nine goals in 77 appearances. After a week-long trial, he joined Swedish club, Östers IF in December 2002, playing in the Allsvenskan, the Swedish top flight. He moved to Assyriska Föreningen in 2005, who were then in the Allsvenskan. He moved back to Latvia in 2006, signing for FK Ventspils, and he scored five goals for Ventspils in the clubs Championship winning 2006 Virslīga season.

Eight days later, Gorkšs scored his first goals for Blackpool in a League Cup second-round tie at Derby County. The Latvian's two goals were both equalisers – one in normal time and one in extra time – in a game that went to a penalty-shootout, won by Blackpool 7–6.

He was named in The Championship "Team of the Week" for a third time on 25 February 2008, alongside teammate Stephen McPhee, and again on 10 March. He was named as the Yorkshire Seasiders Player of the Year on 6 May. The following day, Blackpool activated an option to extend his contract with the club by one year. Following the season, his first full season in English football, in which he had become a regular in the Blackpool side and scored seven goals, Gorkšs was linked with moves to various clubs, including Scottish Premier League club Rangers, as well as fellow Championship clubs Burnley, Crystal Palace, Norwich City, Preston North End and Watford; however, he dismissed the moves as just rumours, stating, "From my point of view it's just a case of carrying on and seeing what happens, that's all I can really do." On 29 May, both he and fellow Blackpool player Wes Hoolahan were linked with a move to Norwich City. On 12 June 2008, Queens Park Rangers confirmed that they had made an official bid to sign Gorkšs. However, on 17 June, Blackpool issued a brief statement, stating that they had reported QPR to the Football Association, and the Football League, for what they claimed was an illegal approach for Gorkšs. Blackpool manager Simon Grayson stated, "we've got to protect the interests of our club and we're led to believe there's been an illegal approach." On 18 June, the Football League, who would be adjudicating on the matter, confirmed that they could block the move, if QPR were found to have "tapped up the player", and that the matter could be referred to a disciplinary commission. On 4 July, it was incorrectly reported in the Latvian media that Gorkšs had signed a contract with QPR. QPR announced on their official website that they had been given permission to speak with the player, and that he had agreed personal terms. However, this was strongly denied by Blackpool, whose club chairman, Karl Oyston stated, "We definitely have not given them permission to speak to him. I'm disappointed once again with the way they've gone about their business." The statement on the QPR official website was later removed.

On 12 February 2013, Gorkšs joined Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers on an emergency loan that ran until the end of the season, with a view to a permanent move at its conclusion. He made fifteen appearances for the club as they suffered relegation to League One. Gorkšs was released by Reading at the end of the 2013–14 season having played 87 games for the club, scoring eight times.
