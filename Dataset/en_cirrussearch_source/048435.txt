2007 Formula 3 Euro Series Drivers' Champion: Romain Grosjean Teams' Champion: ART Grand Prix Nations Cup Champion: France Rookie Cup Champion: Edoardo Mortara Previous 2006 Next 2008 The 2007 Formula 3 Euro Series season was the fifth championship year of Europe’s premier Formula Three series. As in previous years, the championships took place over ten rounds – each with two races – held at a variety of European circuits. Each weekend consisted of one 60-minute practice session and one qualifying session, followed by one c.110 km race and one c.80 km race. The single qualifying session was retained from 2006, with the starting order for race 2 being determined by the finishing order of race 1, with the top eight positions reversed. This season was notable for the return of Volkswagen as an F3 engine supplier. The drivers' title was won by Romain Grosjean and the teams' title was again won by ASM Formule 3. It was the fourth double title win in succession for ASM. The top four drivers in the championship would go on to race in Formula 1: Sébastien Buemi, Kamui Kobayashi and champion Grosjean all debuted in F1 in 2009 and Nico Hülkenberg in 2010.
