The Chüy Valley (Kyrgyz: Чүй өрөөнү, romanized: Chüy Öröönü; Kazakh: Шу аңғары, romanized: Şu añğary; Russian: Чуйская долина) is a large valley located in northern Kyrgyzstan and southern Kazakhstan, in the northern part of the Tian Shan. It extends from Boom Gorge in the east to Muyunkum Desert in the west. It is 250 km (160 mi) long and has an area of about 32,000 km2 (12,000 sq mi). It borders Kyrgyz Ala-Too in the south, and Chu-Ili mountains in the north. Through the Boom Gorge in the narrow eastern part Chüy Valley is linked with Issyk-Kul Valley. The river Chu (Chüy) is the major stream of the valley. The warm summer and availability of drinking and irrigation water makes this area one of the most fertile and most densely populated regions of Kyrgyzstan. There are deposits of zinc ore, lead, gold, and construction materials. The 2006 World Drug Report estimated that 400,000 hectares of cannabis grow wild in the Chüy Valley. The climate is sharply continental. Summers are long and hot, and winters are relatively short and cold. The average temperature of the hottest month (July) is 24.4 °C (76 °F) with a maximum of 43 °C (109 °F). The average temperature of the coldest month (January) is −5.0 °C (23.0 °F) with a minimum of −38 °C (−36 °F). The typical annual precipitation varies from 300 to 500 millimetres (12 to 20 in) in different climatic zones of the valley. Precipitation progressively increases with increasing altitude near Kyrgyz Ala-Too range. Spring and autumn are the rainiest seasons in Chüy Valley.
