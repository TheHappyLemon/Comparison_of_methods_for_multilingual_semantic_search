In Kiribati, there are no longer official administrative divisions but it is possible to divide Kiribati geographically into one isolated island and three archipelagos or island groups: Banaba â€“ isolated island Gilbert Islands Line Islands Phoenix Islands Kiribati was divided into six districts before gaining independence: Banaba Tarawa Northern Gilbert Islands Central Gilbert Island Southern Gilbert Islands Line Islands Four of the former districts (including Tarawa) lie in the Gilbert Islands, where 90% of the country's population lives. Only three of the Line Islands are inhabited, while the Phoenix Islands are uninhabited apart from Canton Island (20 people) and had no official representation. Banaba itself is sparsely inhabited now (330 people in 2020). There is also a representative non-elected of the Banabans relocated since 1945 to Rabi Island in the country of Fiji. There are 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council(s). Two atolls have more than one local council: Tarawa has three and Tabiteuea has two, for a total of 24 local councils. John Hilary Smith as the Governor, created the three councils of Tarawa, in 1972. ISO 3166-2:KI List of islands of Kiribati v t e
