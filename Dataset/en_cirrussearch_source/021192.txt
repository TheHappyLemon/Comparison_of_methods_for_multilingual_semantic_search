French euro coins feature three separate designs for the three series of coins. The minor series was designed by Fabienne Courtiade, the middle one by Laurent Jurio and the major two coins are by Joaquin Jimenez. All designs share the 12 stars of the EU and the year of imprint as well as the letters "RF" for République Française (French Republic). For images of the common side and a detailed description of the coins, see euro coins. To coincide with the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and the 20th anniversary of euro coins, the French national designs on the 1 and 2 euro coins have been changed. The new designs were approved by the Council of the European Union on 26 July 2021 and have been revealed to the public on 16 December 2021 ahead of their entry into circulation in 2022. In 2024, new designs for the 10-, 20-, and 50-cent coins will be introduced, featuring Simone Veil on the 10-cent, Josephine Baker on the 20-cent, and Marie Curie on the 50-cent coin.
