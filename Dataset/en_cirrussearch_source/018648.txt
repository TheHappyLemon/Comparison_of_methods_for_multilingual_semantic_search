While playing for Ventspils, in January 2008 Butriks had a trial period with Football League Championship club Blackpool in England, but didn't stay with the club. Seeking for a new club abroad after UEFA Europa League matches he joined FC Ceahlăul Piatra Neamţ in Romania on loan from FK Ventspils in February 2010. As this was a very unsuccessful period, Butriks didn't play even a match for the club and returned to Ventspils in June 2010. This being away period in Romania had left Butriks out of the team's starting eleven and he found it difficult to fit into the squad, mostly being a late game substitute. Unhappy with that time situation Andrejs left the club in April 2011, signing a contract with another Virsliga club FK Jūrmala-VV. Due to the club's unstable financial situation and poor results Butriks played only 9 league matches and managed to score twice. In July 2011 he left the team, signing a contract abroad in August 2011. This time a one-year contract in Greece with the newly promoted Anagennisi Epanomi, playing in the Greek Second League. Andrejs got himself injured against PAOK, playing just one league game and being released after the season. Following his release Butriks decided to retire from football. In June 2012 he accepted an offer to become the sporting director of his former club FK Ventspils.
