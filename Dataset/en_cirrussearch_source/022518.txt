Mao Asada (浅田 真央, Asada Mao, born 25 September 1990) is a Japanese former competitive figure skater. She is the 2010 Olympic silver medalist, a three-time World champion (2008, 2010, 2014), a three-time Four Continents champion (2008, 2010, 2013), and a four-time Grand Prix Final champion (2005–06, 2008–09, 2012–13, 2013–14). She is the first female figure skater who has landed three triple Axel jumps in one competition, which she achieved at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Asada is also the 2005 World Junior champion, the 2004–05 Junior Grand Prix Final champion, and a six-time Japanese national champion (2006–2009, 2011–2012). She is the former world record holder for the ladies' short program score, which she set at the 2014 World Championships and held until it was broken by Evgenia Medvedeva in 2016. A former prodigy, Asada is the fifth woman and the first junior girl to land the triple Axel, accomplishing this at the 2004–05 Junior Grand Prix Final. She won her first Grand Prix Final at the age of 15. Considered by many to be the best figure skater in the world at that time, Asada was 87 days too young to compete at the 2006 Winter Olympics. She is the first figure skater in a singles discipline from Asia to win multiple world championships. At the 2013 Skate America, she became the first singles skater, male or female, to win all seven of the current events on the Grand Prix series. She holds 15 Grand Prix series titles, the second-highest total among ladies and the sixth-highest total among skaters of all four disciplines. Due to her collection of ISU titles surpassing any other ladies singles figure skater during her time, she has established herself as one of the most highly recognized athletes in Japan and is widely considered to be among the best ladies figure skaters of all time. She is credited with being one of the pioneering ladies skaters that truly combined athleticism and artistry. Notable athletes including Yuzuru Hanyu and Shoma Uno regard Asada as their role model. Mao Asada was born in Meitō-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. She was named after the Japanese actress Mao Daichi. She attended Nagoya International School until the middle of 1st grade.

At this competition, Asada became the first lady to land a triple Axel in the short program at an ISU championship. Asada moved from Japan to the United States in August 2006 to train with Rafael Arutyunyan in Lake Arrowhead, California. There she was able to escape the overcrowding of Japanese rinks and the pressure of the Japanese media. At her first event, the 2006 Skate America, Asada won the bronze medal behind Miki Ando and Kimmie Meissner. While she won the short program, she placed fourth in the free skate, with a total score 171.23 points. She was 21.36 points out of first place.

Before Four Continents, she split with Arutyunyan and returned to Japan to practice on the new Aurora Rink at Chukyo University, where she did not encounter with problems obtaining ice time. Asada competed at both ISU Championships without a coach, but was accompanied by an official from the Japan Skating Federation. Competing for the first time at Four Continents Championships, Asada won both segments and finished 13.71 points ahead of silver medalist Joannie Rochette. In March 2008, at the Worlds Championships, Asada won her first World title. She was second in the short program, 0.18 behind Carolina Kostner. In the free skate, she was second to bronze medalist Yuna Kim by 1.92 points but 0.88 ahead of silver medalist Carolina Kostner. In the summer of 2008, after leaving Arutyunyan, Asada returned to Russia, and was formally coached by Tarasova.

Due to Tarasova's health problems, Asada was coached mostly by her assistant, Shanetta Folle, in Nagoya, Japan; on 1 February 2010, Asada said that she had not been personally coached by Tarasova since the 2009 Rostelecom Cup in October. Tarasova was present with Asada at the 2010 Olympics but after the event, Asada chose to be based in her hometown, Nagoya, and parted ways with Tarasova. From 23 to 25 February, Asada competed at the 2010 Winter Olympics. In the short program on 23 February, she executed a triple Axel-double toe loop, a triple flip and a double Axel and received level fours for all spins and spiral sequence. She scored 73.78 points and placed second in the short program.

She earned a Guinness World Record for the most triple Axels performed by a female skater in a competition – one in the short program and two in the free skating. Asada was Japan's flag-bearer at the closing ceremonies. At the 2010 World Championships, Asada placed second in the short program with 68.08 points, 2.32 behind Mirai Nagasu of the United States. In her triple Axel-double toe loop combination, the Axel was downgraded to a double, but she executed a triple flip and a double Axel and received level fours on all her spins and spiral sequence. Asada reclaimed the world title with an overall score of 197.58 points. She became the first singles figure skater from Asia to win multiple world championship titles. On 17 June 2010, Asada announced that her new jump coach was Hiroshi Nagakubo. In September 2010, Nobuo Sato became Asada's new coach and Asada ended her relationship with coach Nagakubo. After the Vancouver Olympics, Asada relearned all of her jumps from scratch to improve her technique. This contributed to her slump in the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons. Under the guidance of her new coach Nobuo Sato, she relearned all the takeoffs and landings for all her triple jumps, beginning with a single rotation. Despite reworking her jumps, Asada did not skip any competitions in the 2010–11 season. Asada was assigned to the 2010 NHK Trophy and the 2010 Trophée Eric Bompard ISU Grand Prix events. At the 2010 NHK Trophy, Asada placed 8th in both programs and finished 8th overall with a total of 133.40 points.

She won the event and qualified for the 2011–12 Grand Prix Final. She withdrew from the Final due to her mother's serious illness. Her mother died of liver cirrhosis in Nagoya Hospital while Asada was flying back to Japan. Placing second in both programs at the 2011–12 Japan Championships, Asada secured her fifth national title and qualified for the ISU Championships. First in the short program and second in the free, Asada won the silver medal at the 2012 Four Continents Championships behind gold medalist Ashley Wagner of the United States. At the 2012 World Championships, Asada placed fourth in the short program and sixth in the free skating, finishing sixth overall with 164.52 points. After a disappointing sixth at the 2012 World Championships, her mother's death, and the challenges of reworking her jump technique, Asada considered not competing. Upon visiting her choreographer Lori Nichol in May 2012 for an exhibition number, Asada realized that she still liked skating and would continue competing. Asada began the 2012–13 season at the Japan Open, performing to Swan Lake. She won gold at her two Grand Prix events, the 2012 Cup of China and the 2012 NHK Trophy, qualifying her to the 2012–13 Grand Prix Final. Seven years after her triumph in Torino (Italy), and three years after her victory in Goyang City (Korea), Asada won her third title at the Grand Prix Final in Sochi (Russia), placing first in both the short program and free skating. Asada won her sixth national title at the 2012–13 Japan Championships. At the 2013 Four Continents Championships, Asada placed first in the short program with a score of 74.49 points after landing her first triple Axel this season, together with triple flip–double loop combination and a triple loop. She also won the free skate with a score of 130.96, taking the gold medal with an overall score of 205.45 points, while teammates Akiko Suzuki and Kanako Murakami took the silver and bronze medals respectively. This was the second time that Japan had swept the Four Continents Championships' podium. Asada returned to the World podium with a bronze medal finish at the 2013 World Championships with a personal best free skating score of 134.37. Asada placed fifth at the World Team Trophy and team Japan placed third. Asada began the 2013–14 season at the Japan Open, performing to Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 2. She won gold at her two Grand Prix assignments, the 2013 Skate America and the 2013 NHK Trophy. She became the first singles skater, male or female, to win all seven of the current events on the Grand Prix series. At NHK Trophy, she set personal best scores for the free skating and total score. She advanced to the 2013–14 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final where she took her fourth Grand Prix Final title and became the first woman to complete two consecutive Grand Prix seasons undefeated.[citation needed] At all three Grand Prix events, she won by a margin of over ten points. In late December, Asada competed in the 2013–14 Japan Championships. She led after a strong short program, but only placed 3rd in the free skating, dropping to 3rd overall. In the team event at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, Asada skated the ladies' short program. She fell on the triple Axel and placed third individually; team Japan finished fifth. In the ladies' singles event, she placed 16th in the short program after falling on her triple Axel, underrotating a triple flip, and doubling a triple loop. After the unfortunate short program, many established figures in the figure skating community, including Michelle Kwan and Evgeni Plushenko, reached out to her and provided her with support for the free skate. Despite the overwhelming support from fans and members of the figure skating community, the former Japanese Prime Minister and Olympics chairman Yoshirō Mori criticized Asada for "always falling at the most critical time". During a press conference after Sochi, Asada was interviewed about her feelings regarding Mori's comments; she stated that it was in the past and that she has moved on. She rebounded in the free skating, landing 8 triple jumps (two underrotated) and earning a personal best score of 142.71, making her the third woman to score above the 140 mark after Kim Yuna's 2010 Olympics score and Yulia Lipnitskaya's 2014 Olympics team event score. This placed her third in the free skating and sixth overall. Asada's free skating was the most technically difficult of all the ladies and the only one with a triple Axel. This powerful performance solidified her status not only in Japanese sport, but at the Olympics; it was regarded by many as the single best performance of the ladies competition and the low program component score from Olympic judges was met with criticism. At the 2014 World Championships, she broke the world record for the short program by scoring 78.66, 0.16 points higher than the former record set by Yuna Kim at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Asada went on to score 138.03 in the free skating, winning her third world title with a total of 216.69, a personal best for her. With this victory, she became the third woman in the last 45 years (along with Katarina Witt and Michelle Kwan) and the tenth woman to have won three world championship titles. After winning the World Championship title, Asada stated that there was a 50–50 chance she would continue her career. On 19 May 2014, Asada announced she intended to skip the next season. Asada said she was mentally and physically tired and wanted a chance to focus on other aspects of her life, including attending university. On 18 May 2015, Asada announced her intention to make comeback in competitive skating after having taken a one-year break. She had resumed training with coach Nobuo Sato with the aim of returning to competition. Her first competitive performance of the 2015–16 season was at the 2015 Japan Open, where she successfully landed her first triple Axel in over a year of competition absence, her first-place skate to Madama Butterfly led Team Japan to a first-place finish. For the 2015–16 season Grand Prix series, Asada was assigned to compete at 2015 Cup of China and 2015 NHK Trophy. In the short program at the Cup of China, she landed her opening triple Axel and three additional triple jumps (one deemed under-rotated), one of the first women to try the maximum number of triple jumps in the short program. The next day during the free skate, she landed her opening triple Axel but had small errors on her remaining jumps. After winning the short program and placing third in the free skate, she won her first international competition upon returning. This victory extended her grand prix winning streak to eight, the longest in ladies single skating history. She went on to the 2015 NHK Trophy and won the bronze after several problems with her jumping passes. Asada's Grand Prix results qualified her to compete at the 2015–16 Grand Prix Final, where she finished sixth. Asada went on to win bronze at the 2015–16 Japan Championships. She was selected to compete at both the 2016 Four Continents Championships and 2016 World Championships, though she opted to skip the former in order to focus on the latter. In April 2016, Asada stumbled on her opening triple Axel and the triple loop in the short program. The next day she performed a fantastic free skate, landing the triple Axel, triple flip triple loop combination, triple flip and double loop double loop combination in addition to three other jumping passes. Some of the jumps were deemed under-rotated, but the maturity in skating and the polished artistry was received with a standing ovation. She finish seventh at her final worlds event. Asada began her season with a silver medal at the 2016 CS Finlandia Trophy, having finished second to Canada's Kaetlyn Osmond. Her first Grand Prix assignment was 2016 Skate America where she placed 6th. Her second assignment was the 2016 Trophee de France. She then placed 8th in the short program after underrotating her triple flip in combination with the double loop. She also failed to execute a triple-triple. She failed to execute a clean triple jump in the freeskate, placing 10th in that segment and 9th overall. On 10 April 2017, Asada declared on her blog that she had retired from competition. Asada is known for her flexibility in spins and spirals. During her first two years on the international scene, Asada became known for her signature move, the cross-grab Biellmann position. She is also noted for performing the one-handed Biellmann spin in competition. She has received +2.60 grade of execution for her spiral sequence. Asada is also known for the complexity of her footwork sequence and has earned +2.00 grade of execution. Asada landed her first 3A at the age of 12, and she became the first lady to perform a triple-triple-triple combination in national competition – she completed a 3F-3Lo-3T combination. At the age of 14, Asada landed a 3A in her free skating at the 2004–05 Junior Grand Prix Final, held in December 2004 in Helsinki, Finland, becoming the first junior girl to do one in an international event. She has since been known for her 3A jumps. Starting with the 2007–08 season, criteria for judging jump take-off and landing technique became more rigorous, and Asada was penalized for underrotations and change-of-edge errors on her Lutz jump. Asada did not include salchow jumps in her junior and senior career programs until 2008. She had stated previously that the triple salchow was the first triple jump she had ever landed and that she did not have a problem landing it cleanly, but she was not comfortable using the jump in competition because it is one of her least favorite jumps. Asada added the triple salchow to her free skate at the 2008 NHK Trophy and 2008–09 Grand Prix Final. Normally, Asada uses a 3Lo as her second jump in a combination, typically after the 3F. However, she added the toe loop to her free skate as the second jump of her first triple-triple combination during the 2004–05 season, a 3F-3T. In the 2006–07 season she used the 2A-3T, while in the 2007–08 season she performed the 3F-3T again. In the 2008–09 season, she executed the 3A-2T combination in international competition, first getting full credit for it at the 2008–09 Grand Prix Final. At that same competition, Asada became the first female skater to land two 3A in the same program. She became the first lady to land 3 triple Axels in the same competition (1 in the short, 2 in the long). She also has a Guinness World Record for the most triple Axels performed by a female skater in competition. After finishing second in 2010 Winter Olympics, Asada decided to rework her jumps. The goal was a more fluid jump technique, achieved by adding speed to the approach run to increase the height of the jump and the speed of spins. Asada also corrected her habit of moving her shoulders up and down before jumping. The reworking process set her back for two seasons. Asada found that her jumping began to suffer and she was making mistakes on all her jumps. During the 2012–13 season, her performance improved and she maintained a winning streak. Her component score, which had mostly remained in the 7 range, edged above 8. By the 2013–14 season, Asada said, "every single one of my skating techniques had been changed." In 2014 Winter Olympics Ladies Free Skating event, Asada executed all six triple jumps. Asada has been known to practice and land quadruple jumps in training. She credits training alongside Takahiko Kozuka for improving her spins. The number of rotations she achieves with one kick increased from 30 to 104.

Asada is very popular in Japan and is credited with increasing the popularity of figure skating in Japan. Since gaining national attention while still on the junior circuit, she is a household name in Japan, known by the affectionate nickname "Mao-chan". During the 2014 Winter Olympics, Asada became the most discussed and mentioned athlete of the Olympics on the social networking website Twitter, ahead of Yuna Kim, ice hockey player T. J. Oshie, and snowboarder Shaun White. Asada headlines her own exhibition show called "The Ice", which began in the summer of 2008, with her sister Mai Asada. Her skating music was compiled on two albums by EMI Music Japan: Mai & Mao Asada Skating Music and Mai & Mao Asada Skating Music 2008–09. The Asada sisters have also been named as goodwill ambassadors to Canada. In 2011, Asada launched her own kimono brand named MaoMao. In January 2012, Asada cancelled the release of a book on her skating career; she stated, "The way the book was advertised was different from what I had in mind." Asada has appeared in many variety television shows and in commercials. She and her dog Aero, named after Aero chocolates, have been featured in chocolate commercials in Japan. Asada has been sponsored by Coca-Cola, Itoham Foods, Kao ("Asience"), Lotte, Nestlé, Oji Paper Company ("Nepia"), Olympus Corporation, Omron, and Weider. Her current sponsors include Airweave, Arsoa, Japan Airlines, Kuriyama Holdings, MiO, Morinaga & Company, Sato Pharmaceutical, Sumitomo Life, Toho Gas, and Triple Yogurt. On 25 December 2013, Japan Airlines unveiled a new Boeing 777–300 (JA8942) with a special Mao Asada livery to promote Japan's participation in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, a popular Vancouver Japanese street food vendor, Japadog, named a hot dog after Asada called the Mao Dog. Similarly, a local sushi store created a sushi roll and named it the Mao Roll after Asada. After Asada's silver medal win, Japanese dollmaker Kyugetsu created a Mao Asada hina doll in celebration of her efforts. In December 2013, chrysanthemum farmers in the Ryukyu Islands named a new crop of chrysanthemums "Mao Orange" after the colour of Asada's short program dress from the 2012–13 season. On 8 April 2014, Asada's exhibition named "Smile" opened at Takashimaya department store in Tokyo's Nihonbashi district. This drew more than 10,000 visitors on its first day, outperforming every other event opening at the establishment for the past 10 years. In just nine days, it hit more than 100,000 visitors, the shortest period to reach the milestone in Takashimaya's history. The exhibition includes a collection of 30 costumes that were worn by Asada and a display of medals she has won over the years, among them the silver she scooped up at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. On 5 July 2014, Asada debuted as a reporter for the long-running travel program "Sekai Fushigi Hakken!" by TBS. For this documentary, she traveled to Austria, Slovakia and Hungary for eight days to find the origin of figure skating. In March 2015, Asada made her debut as DJ host for her weekly radio show program "Mao Asada's Nippon Smile". This program was sponsored by Sumitomo Life Insurance Ltd. Co. and aired in TBS radio from March 2015 to June 2015. She is a big fan of Japanese pop star Ayumi Hamasaki, and was seen congratulating her on her 10th Anniversary. French Olympic Medalist figure skater Philippe Candeloro is a huge fan of Mao Asada and calls himself her godfather. "Mao Thanks Tour" (浅田真央サンクスツアー) was founded by Mao Asada in 2018, soon after her retirement, to express gratitude to the fans for their love and support. She became the producer, the director and the main star of the project. In her column for Number, Asada named it "the second stage of my skating life". It was a special 80-minute ice show centered around Asada and her memorable programs. The choreography was updated in many of them, and the music was rearranged. Some programs were recreated from scratch but kept the original atmosphere with recognizable details. There were 10 members on cast including Mao, her sister Mai Asada (in 2018), Takahito Mura, Sei Kawahara, and Haruka Imai (she joined the tour in 2019 to replace Mai who could not stay with them because of her TV work). Six skaters came to the auditions and were hired by Asada in spite of being nowhere near to an elite status. Two had retired years ago, unknown to the general public. Four were students, one from Mongolia, one from Spain, with zero experience in shows. Discussing her choice, Asada explained that she wanted to give a chance to those who loved figure skating but had to quit early, due to injuries and unlucky circumstances. Her approach was the opposite to a typical ice show concept of attracting the audience by famous names. It also meant a larger amount of work for everyone. Asada herself skated 10 programs out of 18. Mura and Imai had their own solo parts too, and each performer appeared on ice at least 6–7 times in group numbers. That was a challenge but, as Mura stated, it made them all really involved and willing to do their bests. Another challenge was to lower prices for tickets (usually way too expensive) so that more people could afford them. Asada and her team managed to do it performing at small arenas with permanent ice, a strategy that helped to reduce the set-up time and costs. Visiting small towns as well as big cities made the show available all around the country. On the other hand, they were not saving on the visual side so the lighting and costumes were of high quality. The tour began on May 3, 2018 in Niigata, and ended on April 27, 2021 in Yokohama. At the start it was planned to hold 10 performances nationwide. However, the response of the audience was so strong that they continued to add more and more locations, taking new invitations that followed. The official website of the tour had a special map showing their journey in progress. As a result, within 4 years Mao Thanks Tour visited all the 47 prefectures of Japan and held 202 performances.
