Klubi Futbollistik Teuta Durrës, commonly referred to as Teuta, is an Albanian professional football club based in Durrës. They currently compete in the Kategoria Superiore and they play their home games at the Niko Dovana Stadium. The club was founded on 29 January 1920 as Klubi Sportiv Urani (Uranium Sport Club), and they were a founding member of the Albanian National Championship in 1930, as well as runners-up in the 1931 National Championship. They have won the Kategoria Superiore twice in 1994 and in 2021, and they have also won the Albanian Cup four times, as well as finishing runners-up in three Albanian Supercups. The club was founded on 29 January 1920 as Klubi Sportiv Urani, which literally translates to Uranium Sport Club, and they changed their name to Sport Klub Durrës just two years later 1922. They kept the same name until they joined the Albania national championship as one of the original six members alongside SK Tiranë, Skënderbeu Korçë, Bashkimi Shkodran, Urani Elbasan and Sportklub Vlorë. In 1930, before entering the National Championship, the club changes its name to the Klubi Sportiv Teuta Durrës, in reference to Queen Teuta of Illyria. In the first national championship they finished fifth out of six teams, collecting three wins and two draws out of ten games. The following season they finished as runners-up in the league, as they lost 4–1 in the championship final against SK Tiranë, where the club's goalkeeper Niko Dovana famously scored the equaliser in the first leg which ended in a 1–1 draw. After Communism took control of Albania the club was forced to change its name to KS Ylli i Kuq Durrës, literally meaning KS Red Star Durrës. Just 3 years later in 1950 the club dropped KS Red Star Durrës from its name and was simply called SK Durrës once again, before renaming to SK Puna Durrës a 1-year later in 1951. The club changed its name again in 1958 to KS Lokomotiva Durrës which they kept until the fall of Communism in Albania in 1991. Since 1991 the club has renamed KS Teuta Durrës, with the football team being called KF Teuta.
