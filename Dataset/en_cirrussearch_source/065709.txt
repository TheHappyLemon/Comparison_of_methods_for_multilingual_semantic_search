The Pelegrin Tarragon is a Latvian ultralight aircraft that is produced by Pelegrin Limited of Ādaži, introduced in 2010. The aircraft is supplied complete and ready-to-fly. Named for the herb, the Tarragon was developed from the Millennium Master after the manufacturer of that design went bankrupt. The Tarragon has been developed by Pelegrin in conjunction with CFM Air. The Tarragon was designed to comply with the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight rules. It features a cantilever low-wing, an enclosed cockpit with two-seats-in-tandem under a bubble canopy, retractable tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The Tarragon's airframe is made from pre-preg carbon fibre composites. Its 7.94 m (26.0 ft) span wing mounts flaps. Standard engines available are the 100 hp (75 kW) EPA Power SA-R917TNi ULM, the 100 hp (75 kW) Rotax 912ULS and Rotax 912iS, the turbocharged 115 hp (86 kW) Rotax 914, the 135 hp (101 kW) Rotax 915 iS and the 130 hp (97 kW) EPA Power SA917Ti Turbo Injection four-stroke powerplants.
