The Volkswagen Touran is a car manufactured by German automaker Volkswagen since 2003 and sold in Europe and other select markets. A compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV),[improper synthesis?] it fills a gap in Volkswagen's model lineup between the Volkswagen Golf, with which it shares its platform, and the Volkswagen Sharan, its larger counterpart, which ceased production in 2022. The vehicle has been sold in Japan as the Golf Touran and the crossover-styled variant as the CrossTouran. The name 'Touran' is derived from the combination of 'Tour' and 'Sharan'. Despite the similarity of their names, the Touran is not related to the North American market Volkswagen Routan. The vehicle is delivered in five or seven seat versions. Announced back in August 2002, the Touran, whose production started in December 2002 and sales commenced in 2003, is the first Volkswagen MPV based on a Golf platform, more precisely the first vehicle on PQ35 platform. It joined Volkswagen's existing MPV line up that included the Sharan and Caravelle (Volkswagen Bus). It can be considered an extended version of the Golf Plus, since their front ends are similar in size, while the Touran's rear overhang is 200 mm (7.87 in) longer (and therefore a seven-seater, while the Golf Plus is a five seater). The Touran introduced electro-mechanical steering, a first in its class and for Volkswagen. It is able to vary the weight of the steering depending on the road speed. Due to the lack of energy consumption in idle it also improves the overall efficiency of the vehicle. The Touran was the first vehicle to use Volkswagen's 2.0 TDI engine. The engines available at the launch included a 1.6 FSI and two diesel engines, the 1.9 TDI with 74 kW (101 PS; 99 hp) and the 2.0 TDI 103 kW (140 PS; 138 hp). The engines are EURO 4 compliant, except the 1.9 TDi when paired with the DSG (direct shift gearbox). The Touran launched with a six speed manual gearbox as standard, and a DSG for the 1.9 TDI Engines.[citation needed] The initial test of the Touran in 2003, resulted in a four star rating for adult protection. Volkswagen made slight changes to the Touran from November 2003, adding "an intelligent reminder for the driver and front passenger to buckle their seat belts." This allowed the Touran to be retested the same year, scoring a single extra point, and so giving the car a five star rating for adult protection: The Touran received a facelift for the October 2006 Paris Motor Show. The 2007 model year Touran was the first production vehicle in the Volkswagen Group to be released with the new Park Assist technology. Park Assist helps the driver parallel park the vehicle. Firstly, after having activated the feature and whilst travelling up to 30 km/h Park Assist uses sensors to attempt to identify a suitable parking spot (defined as 0.8 metres longer than the length of the vehicle). The driver then stops ahead of the parking spot, releases the steering wheel, but continues working the gears, accelerator and brake pedal as advised by the display panels, as the Park Assist controls the steering to park the vehicle. At the December 2006 Bologna Motor Show, Volkswagen released the third Cross vehicle designed by Volkswagen Individual GmbH. The CrossTouran is distinguished from a standard Touran by its 17-inch alloy wheels, redesigned plastic guards which ape a crossover vehicle, and a 15 mm (0.59 in) higher suspension/chassis setup that is optional for standard Tourans in Europe. All CrossTouran engines are EU4 compliant. Petrol engines 1.6 MPI with 75 kW / 102 hp 1.4 TSI with 103 kW / 140 hp 2.0 TSI with 125 kW / 170 hp Diesel engines 1.9 TDI with 77 kW / 105 hp 2.0 TDI with 103 kW / 140 hp 2.0 TDI with 125 kW / 170 hp When the vehicle was released to the markets in August 2010, the Touran was updated to the newer Golf VI looks. This included as new features compared to the previous generation the option for DCC (Volkswagen's adaptive suspension system), Light-Assist for Xenon Headlights, an improved Park-Assist System that can also handle perpendicular park positions and updated infotainment systems. The aerodynamics of the car were also improved, the Cw improved from 0,31 to 0,32 to 0,29. In late 2010, SAIC-VW released the new Touran in China. Though its front was updated to the German style, the tail keeps the design of the previous generation model. The electronic systems of this domestically produced car were upgraded as its relative in Europe. A 1.4 TSI, which can output 93 kW, was added to the new model. New engines were available following the downsizing trend, a 1.2 with 77 kW (105 PS; 103 hp) and a new 1.6 TDI with 66 kW (90 PS; 89 hp) or 77 kW (105 PS; 103 hp). They replaced the 1.6 and 1.9 TDI from the previous model. The 1.2, 77 kW (105 PS; 103 hp) and 1.6 TDI 77 kW (105 PS; 103 hp) were also available as BlueMotion, Volkswagen's low fuel consumption vehicle program. In 2012, the 125 kW (170 PS; 168 hp) engine was replaced with the 130 kW (177 PS; 174 hp). 2010 facelift 2010 facelift 2010 facelift (China) 2010 facelift (China) The Touran is available with petrol, diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) engines. The diesel models of the Touran offer better fuel economy. Given the proper conditions, it is possible to achieve over 60 mpg‑imp (4.7 L/100 km; 50 mpg‑US) in a diesel Touran. The car is delivered with a five- (1.6 only) and six speed manual transmissions, Tiptronic six speed automatic transmission (in 1.6, 1.6 FSI and 2.0 FSI (2003 to 2006 only)) or the DSG twin clutch automatic transmission; the 1.4 TSI, the 1.6 FSI from 2003 to 2006, the 1.9 TDI from 2003 to 2008, and the 2.0 TDI uses the six speed version, and the 1.9 TDI since the middle of 2008 use the seven-speed dry clutch version. As for the 2010 model, an updated version of the 2.0 TDI engine was launched with common rail technology. The engine was introduced in the Volkswagen Passat in the models from 2008. The Touran Hy Motion is Volkswagen's Hydrogen Development concept. It has a nickel-metal hydride battery which produces 80 kW (107 hp), it does the 0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) sprint in 14 seconds and has a top speed of 140 km/h (87.0 mph). In 2008, Shanghai-Volkswagen with Tongji University had released a Touran Hybrid, as part of the lead up to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. A prototype of the Touran Hybrid was shown with a 20 kW (27 hp) electric motor in conjunction with a 110 kW (148 hp) petrol engine, the transmission will most likely be Volkswagen's Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG). Distinguishing different model years of the model can be difficult, but there are some minor changes which can help: up to 10/2004, the fog lights use a projector lens, after that, it was changed to a reflector type for the 2008 model year, the colour of the tinted glass was changed from green to gray (change was not applied to SAIC-VW built vehicles) for the 2009 model year, the fog lights were changed again, this time from a round shape, to a slightly elipsoid one, the grilles surrounding them are new also. for the 2010 model year, the 1T2 generation, received new side rear-view mirrors, from the Golf 6 from 10/12/2012, the 1T3 received a sound insulated front windscreen, with the rain and light sensor being moved down 10mm The Touran won What Car?'s 2005 Compact Van of the Year award. The Touran scored a maximum five star Euro NCAP crash safety rating. The second generation Touran was introduced at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. It uses the Volkswagen Group MQB platform and offers increased cabin space, four new engines with 19% less fuel consumption, and an array of new advanced driver-assistance systems and infotainment options. Autoradio with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is included as an option. Visually, the car resembles Golf Sportsvan with an elongated rear trunk. The Touran currently serves as the successor to the Volkswagen Santana in Shanghai's taxi fleet since October 2018, as the Santana was phased out. Qiangsheng, one of the largest taxi firms in Shanghai, stated that the Touran offered greater passenger comfort over its predecessor. 100 new electric cabs were also added to the taxi fleet.

It is available in 280TSI and 330TSI trims with the 1.4 litre TSI, known as the CSS in China, available on 280TSI models and the 1.8 litre TSI for 330TSI models.
