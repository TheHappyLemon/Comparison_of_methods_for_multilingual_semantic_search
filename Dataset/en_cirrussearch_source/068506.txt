Andoni Iraola Sagarna (Basque pronunciation: [andoni iɾa.ola s̺aɣarna], Spanish: [anˈdoni iɾaˈola saˈɣaɾna]; born 22 June 1982) is a Spanish professional football manager and former player who is the current manager of Premier League club AFC Bournemouth. Utilised primarily as a right-back through his career, he was highly combative and possessed good passing skills. He spent the vast majority of his professional career with Athletic Bilbao, appearing in 510 competitive matches over 12 seasons. Iraola began managing in 2018, being in charge of Rayo Vallecano for three years. In 2023, he was appointed as manager of Premier League club Bournemouth. Iraola was born in Usurbil, Gipuzkoa. He played as a youth for Antiguoko, alongside teammates such as Mikel Arteta, Xabi Alonso, Mikel Alonso and Aritz Aduriz. A product of Athletic Bilbao's youth system at Lezama, he made his debut with the first team in the 2003–04 season, becoming first-choice while often taking penalties and free kicks. On 30 August 2003, he made his first La Liga appearance, starting in a 1–0 home loss against FC Barcelona, and his five goals in 30 appearances helped the team to qualify for the UEFA Cup. During his 12 seasons, Iraola never played fewer than 30 league matches, scoring in all but one league campaign – like former club legend Aitor Larrazábal, who played as a left-back– while also helping the Basque side to finish second in three Copa del Rey tournaments and the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League. On 28 January 2007, he netted twice in a 2–0 away win over neighbours Real Sociedad, who were finally relegated; Athletic narrowly avoided the drop, ranking in 17th position. He played his first cup final in 2009, a 4–1 loss to Barcelona at Mestalla in Valencia, and three years later helped them to finish runners-up in both the domestic cup and the Europa League. 2012–13 marked the first year where Iraola failed to find the net in the league, but he continued to be the side's first-choice in his position as he featured in 35 games. His only goal of the season came on 24 August 2012 in a 6–0 home rout of HJK Helsinki in the playoff round of the UEFA Europa League (9–3 on aggregate). Iraola renewed his contract with the club on 4 December 2013, keeping him at the San Mamés until 30 June 2015. In the 24th minute of his last league appearance against Villarreal CF in May 2015, Aritz Aduriz offered him the taking of a penalty kick but he declined, so the former converted it instead; the two players then combined for Iraola to score from open play four minutes later. He captained the team in his last match, the 2015 Copa del Rey final which was lost 3–1 to Barcelona. On 16 June 2015, aged 33, Iraola moved abroad for the first time in his career, signing for Major League Soccer club New York City FC. He made his debut against Toronto FC at the Yankee Stadium on 12 July, playing the entirety of a 4–4 draw. Iraola announced his retirement on 17 November 2016. On 20 August 2008, Iraola was called by new Spain coach Vicente del Bosque for a friendly with Denmark, alongside teammate Fernando Amorebieta. He entered the pitch in the final 15 minutes of the 3–0 away victory, coming in as a substitute for Sergio Ramos. On 29 March 2011, after nearly one and a half years without playing for the national team, Iraola started in a 3–1 defeat of Lithuania in Kaunas for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifiers. He was due to make the cut for the final squad, but injury forced him out in favour of Atlético Madrid's Juanfran. Iraola played on the Basque representative side for a full decade, having debuted late on in a 2–1 win over Uruguay on 27 December 2003. Iraola was appointed manager of Cypriot club AEK Larnaca FC on 18 June 2018, succeeding his compatriot Imanol Idiakez. He was sacked the following 14 January, after nearly two months without winning a single match. On 10 July 2019, Iraola replaced the departed Borja Jiménez at the helm of CD Mirandés, newly promoted to Segunda División. He took the team to the semi-finals of the Spanish Cup for the second time in their 92-year history, notably disposing of top-tier sides RC Celta de Vigo, Sevilla FC and Villarreal. On 21 July 2020, he left the club as his contract expired. Iraola remained in the second division in August 2020, taking over from Paco Jémez at Rayo Vallecano. On 6 July 2021, after achieving promotion in the playoffs, he extended his contract until 2022. The following season, he again led a club to the last four of the national cup; it was the second time Rayo had achieved this, the first occasion coming 40 years earlier. In February 2023, Iraola was approached by Leeds United of the Premier League, but was not given permission to leave the Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas. He left at the end of the season, having turned down a renewal offer. On 19 June 2023, Iraola was appointed manager of AFC Bournemouth on a two-year deal. His first match in charge was a 1–1 home draw with West Ham United on 12 August 2023, in which Dominic Solanke scored a late equaliser. He achieved his first win in the tenth league round, beating Burnley 2–1, with goals from Antoine Semenyo and Philip Billing. Iraola favours a 4-3-3/4-3-2-1 formation with a focus on quick ball recoveries. With quick wingers, tireless midfield runners and a defensive midfielder who tends to drop deep when building from the back when the full-backs push forward, Iraola's emphasis is on catching the opposition off guard. Includes other competitive competitions, including the Supercopa de España, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup, MLS playoffs.
