In his first match against Marseille for the first time, which saw them draw 0–0 on 18 September 2016, Nkoulou received boos from Marseille supporters during the match every time he touched the ball. Around the same time he was competing with Mouctar Diakhaby, Nkoulou's performance soon came under criticism by observers, prompting Manager Bruno Génésio defended him.
