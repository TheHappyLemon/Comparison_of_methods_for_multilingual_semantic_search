In geography, a cape is a headland, peninsula or promontory extending into a body of water, usually a sea. A cape usually represents a marked change in trend of the coastline, often making them important landmarks in sea navigation. This also makes them prone to natural forms of erosion, mainly tidal actions, resulting in a relatively short geological lifespan. Capes can be formed by glaciers, volcanoes, and changes in sea level. Erosion plays a large role in each of these methods of formation.[citation needed] Cape Cornwall, England Satellite image of Cape Fear, North Carolina Cape MacLear, Malawi Map depicting Cape Horn at the southernmost portion of South America Photograph of Cabo Mayor in Santander, Spain Photograph of Cape Cambell, New Zealand, at sunrise Extreme points of Africa Extreme points of Asia Extreme points of Europe Extreme points of North America Extreme points of South America Whittow, John (1984).
