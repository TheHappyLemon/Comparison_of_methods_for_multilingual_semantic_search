"Voyage, voyage" (French pronunciation: [vwajaʒ vwajaʒ]) is a song by French singer Desireless, released as the first single from her debut studio album, François (1989). It was written by Jean-Michel Rivat and Dominique Dubois, and produced by the former. Sung entirely in French, the song transcended the language barrier on the music charts and became a huge international success between 1986 and 1988, reaching the top position in more than ten countries across Europe. A review in Pan-European magazine Music & Media described "Voyage, Voyage" as a song having a "high-pitched, dramatic vocals over a contagious electro-beat, in an Alphaville-type of setting. Very strong chart appeal outside France, especially in an English translation". Since "Voyage, voyage" is sung exclusively in French, its chart success came as a surprise as it managed the rare feat of becoming a success in several nations usually closed to Francophone songs and artists, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland. In West Germany, the song topped the chart, and has the longest chart trajectory of 1987 in the top 20. It also reached number one in Austria, Norway, and Spain. The song missed the top spot in France, peaking at number two for four weeks, behind Elsa Lunghini's "T'en va pas". The song initially reached number 53 on the UK Singles Chart in November 1987. After being remixed by Pete Hammond and Pete Waterman of PWL, the song was re-released in the United Kingdom in the spring of 1988, and climbed to number five in June of that year. The song's success continued in Ireland, where it reached number four twice, the original version in November 1987, followed by the PWL remix in June 1988. The music video for "Voyage, voyage" was directed by Bettina Rheims, and premiered in France in December 1986. It depicts Desireless entering a manor where a number of people are listlessly lingering around, and enticing them with her song and a slideshow to see the world and make more out of their lives. 7-inch single A.
