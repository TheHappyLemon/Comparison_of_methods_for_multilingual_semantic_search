The Wright Valley (77°31′S 161°50′E﻿ / ﻿77.517°S 161.833°E﻿ / -77.517; 161.833﻿ (Wright Valley)) is a large east–west trending valley, formerly occupied by a glacier but now ice free except for Wright Upper Glacier at its head and Wright Lower Glacier at its mouth, in Victoria Land, Antarctica. It was named by the VUWAE (1958-59) for Sir Charles Wright, for whom the BrAE (1910-13) named the glacier at the mouth of this valley. The Wright Valley is the central one of the three large McMurdo Dry Valleys in the Transantarctic Mountains, located west of McMurdo Sound. Wright Valley contains the Onyx River, the longest river in Antarctica, Lake Brownworth, the origin of the Onyx River, and Lake Vanda, which is fed by the Onyx River. Its southwestern branch, South Fork, is the location of Don Juan Pond. The upland area known as the Labyrinth is at the valley's west end. Although portions of the interconnected valley system were discovered in 1903 by the Discovery expedition led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott, the Wright Valley located near the centre of the system was not seen until aerial photographs of the region were made in 1947. By the mid-1960s scientists were becoming increasingly intrigued by the paradoxical fact that the valley lay immediately adjacent to the permanent East Antarctic Ice Sheet, yet had remained ice-free for at least thousands of years. Although Lake Vanda is covered by roughly 3 metres (9.8 ft) of ice year-round, lake temperatures of 25 °C (77 °F) had been reliably measured at a depth of 65 metres (213 ft). Increasing summer field activity and a clear need to establish a winter record led New Zealand's Antarctic Division and the National Science Foundation of the United States to plan a more permanent base in the valley. In 1968 New Zealand established Vanda Station near the eastern end of Lake Vanda.

It runs from Wright Upper Glacier in the west to Wright Lower Glacier to the east. It separates the Olympus Range to the north from the Asgard Range to the south. Features of the valley, from west to east, include the Labyrinth, Don Juan Pond, Dais, North Fork, South Fork, Lake Vanda, Lake Canopus, Onyx River and Lake Brownsworth. 77°33′S 160°50′E﻿ / ﻿77.550°S 160.833°E﻿ / -77.550; 160.833. An extensive flat upland area which has been deeply eroded at the west end of Wright Valley, in Victoria Land. So named by the VUWAE (1958-59) because the eroded dolerite of which it is formed gives an appearance of a labyrinth. 77°30′S 160°50′E﻿ / ﻿77.500°S 160.833°E﻿ / -77.500; 160.833.

Named by the NZ-APC in 1984 after the Minotaur, in association with names from Greek mythology in the Olympus Range. 77°33′S 161°03′E﻿ / ﻿77.550°S 161.050°E﻿ / -77.550; 161.050. An ice-free col at 600 metres (2,000 ft), connecting the east edge of the Labyrinth and the west edge of the Dais, in Wright Valley, Victoria Land.

An elongated mesa between Labyrinth and Lake Vanda in the western part of Wright Valley, in Victoria Land. Descriptively named by the VUWAE, 1958-59. 77°34′S 161°11′E﻿ / ﻿77.567°S 161.183°E﻿ / -77.567; 161.183. A shallow saline pond located south of the Dais in the South Fork of Wright Valley, Victoria Land. The pond was sighted on October 11, 1961 in a field reconnaissance by United States Navy helicopter. In the next three months, a USARP party with George H. Meyer and others made several trips to study the pond. They named it Don Juan Pond for Lieutenants Donald Roe and John Hickey, United States Navy Air Development Squadron Six, who were of assistance to the field party. A new mineral, calcium chloride hexahydrate, was discovered in the pond. The name Antarcticite was proposed for the new mineral. 77°32′S 161°15′E﻿ / ﻿77.533°S 161.250°E﻿ / -77.533; 161.250.
