The club plays in the Belarusian Premier League, the top division in Belarusian football. In 2019, Dynamo won its first Belarusian Premier League title. The club has also won the Belarusian Cup in 2007, 2017 and 2018. The club was founded in 1960 as Spartak Brest and joined Soviet Class B (second-tier league) the same year. After the 1962 season, they were relegated as a result of league reorganization. They came close to promotion twice in 1964 and 1967 but lost the final round both times. They were finally promoted on their third attempt in 1969, but the following year they again dropped to the third tier due to league reorganization. In 1972, the team was renamed Bug Brest and finally, in 1976 Dуnamo Brest. From 1970 until the end of the Soviet era, the club was playing in the Soviet third-tier league. Dynamo Brest had a strong connection with Dinamo Minsk during these years (as both clubs were affiliated to Dinamo Sports Society) and often accepted young Minsk team players on loan. In 1992, Dynamo Brest joined the Belarusian Premier League and have been playing there ever since. Their best result was a title in 2019 season, with 5 points of difference to BATE Borisov. In 2007, Dynamo Brest won the Belarusian Cup, also securing their only UEFA Cup participation. During the 2012 season, they were using the name FC Brest due to legal issues with using a Dynamo brand name the rights to which were claimed by Belarusian Dynamo Sport Society. This issue was resolved only by the end of the year.
