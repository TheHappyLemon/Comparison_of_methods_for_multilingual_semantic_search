Gjeravica (Albanian: Gjeravicë; Serbian Cyrillic: Ђеравица/Đeravica) is a mountain peak in Kosovo. It also is the second-highest mountain peak in the Accursed Mountains range and the Dinaric Alps range, after Maja Jezercë. It has an elevation of 2,656 m (8,714 ft) above sea level. Gjeravica is in the western part of Kosovo, in the municipality of Junik. Gjeravica is somewhat different from the rest of the Accursed mountains in its lack of the stony, limestone texture the other mountains in Accursed Mountains have.[citation needed] Many large and small glacial lakes can be found near the summit. The largest of the lakes is Gjeravica Lake, which is just under the summit and is the origin of the Erenik river. Gjeravica and the Accursed mountains are mostly known for the growth of chestnuts.[citation needed] There are also wild strawberries growing in Gjeravica during the summer.[citation needed] Deçan Junik Peja Belaje Krsi i Cenit Krsi i Zi Kumulore Tropojske Pločice Guri i Gjate Maja e Ram Arućit Ljogi i Prels Biga Tamas Krsi i Cenit Kumulore Krsi i Zi Guri i Mal Gurt e Ljove Brehov Minarja Kroni Tedel Kroni Gusija Kroni i Lizit Kroni i Nuses Gura e Hasanags Kroni i Metes Gura e Mir Kroni i Rasave Kroni i Smajlit Gura i Cursis Gura Hods Kroni i Mir "CIA World Factbook 2014: Kosovo".
