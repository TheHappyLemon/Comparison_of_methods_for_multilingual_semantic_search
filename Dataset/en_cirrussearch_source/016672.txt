Narva railway station (Estonian: Narva raudteejaam) is the easternmost railway station in Estonia, serving the city of Narva. The station was opened in 1870, and the first station building was destroyed in 1919 during the Estonian War of Independence. The second station building was constructed in 1922, and it was demolished during World War II. Following World War II, the current neoclassical station building was constructed. The station building today hosts a passport control and customs office, which are open when trains to/from Russia depart/arrive. The waiting hall is open during daytime, but has no facilities, such as luggage lockers, WC nor a ticket office (the nearby bus station has a toilet but no left luggage service). Access to platforms is only possible in conjunction with train departures and arrivals. In the 2018 timetable, there are 4 passenger trains a day to Tallinn Balti jaam operated by Elron (rail transit). List of railway stations in Estonia Rail transport in Estonia "Network and Stations".
