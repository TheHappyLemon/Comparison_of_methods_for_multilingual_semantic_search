Bob Jungels (born 22 September 1992) is a Luxembourgish road bicycle racer, who rides for UCI WorldTeam Bora–Hansgrohe. Born in Rollingen, Mersch, Luxembourg, Jungels competed in the Tour de France for the first time in 2015, as part of the UCI World Tour team Trek Factory Racing, finishing 27th overall and 5th in the young rider classification. Jungels signed for Etixx–Quick-Step for the 2016 and 2017 seasons. He was named in the start list for the 2016 Giro d'Italia where he finished sixth overall and won the young rider classification. In 2017 he confirmed his ambitions in the general classification by finishing 8th in the Giro d'Italia. He also defended the young rider classification from the previous edition. Only Vladimir Poulnikov and Pavel Tonkov won the classification in consecutive years before him. In the process he was able to take stage 15 and became the first rider from Luxembourg, since Charly Gaul 56 years earlier, to win at the Giro d'Italia. In 2018, Jungels won Liège–Bastogne–Liège after a solo attack on the Côte de la Roche-aux-Faucons. In August 2020, Jungels signed a two-year contract with the AG2R Citroën Team from the 2021 season. His first season with the French squad was hampered first by a back injury and then a head injury suffered in a crash in the Amstel Gold Race. Then in June 2021 the team announced that he would miss the Tour de France and the COVID-19 pandemic-delayed 2020 Summer Olympics for surgery for iliac artery endofibrosis. He returned to competition after a 93-day absence at the Tour de Luxembourg in September. Jungels regained his title at the Luxembourgish National Time Trial Championships in 2022, finishing around half a minute faster than any other competitor over the 13.6-kilometre (8.5-mile) course in Nospelt. Following this success, Jungels' next race was the Tour de France – prior to the race, he tested positive for COVID-19 on the two days prior to the opening individual time trial stage, but was allowed to compete by both the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and race organisers Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO). After finishing in the top-ten placings in the sprint finish on stage eight, Jungels got into the breakaway on the following stage. On the day's third categorised climb, the Col de la Croix, Jungels attacked the breakaway group with 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) left to climb. Jungels eventually soloed to victory as the race returned to France, finishing 22 seconds clear of Jonathan Castroviejo in Châtel, to become the first cyclist from Luxembourg to win a stage since Andy Schleck in 2011. He ultimately finished the race in 12th place overall. In August 2022, it was announced that Jungels was to join Bora–Hansgrohe for the 2023 season, on an initial two-year contract with an option for a further year.
