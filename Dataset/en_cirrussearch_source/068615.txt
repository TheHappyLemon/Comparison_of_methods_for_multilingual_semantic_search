For Homeland, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2013. Baccarin was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the daughter of actress Vera Setta and Fernando Baccarin, a journalist. Through her father, she is of part Italian descent with roots in Veneto. Baccarin attended Public School 41 and New York City Lab School for Collaborative Studies, where her future Homeland co-star Claire Danes and she were classmates. She later entered the theater program at the Juilliard School, where she was in the drama division's Group 29 (1996–2000). Baccarin landed her first film role in the improvised fashion-world comedy Perfume (2001). This was followed by a lead role in Way Off Broadway (2001). She served as Natalie Portman's understudy in the Central Park production of The Seagull. The science-fiction drama Firefly (2002) as Inara Serra was Baccarin's first television series, and she reprised her role in the 2005 film Serenity. In February 2005, Baccarin provided the voice for Black Canary in multiple episodes of the animated series Justice League Unlimited.

Baccarin reprised her role in the film Stargate: The Ark of Truth. In May 2009, Baccarin made her off-Broadway debut in Theresa Rebeck's television satire Our House at Playwrights Horizons in New York City. She landed the lead role of Anna, the leader of the alien Visitors, in ABC's 2009–2011 series V, a remake of the 1984 series. In May 2011, shortly following the airing of the show's second-season finale, producers announced that the show would not return for a third season. That same month, Baccarin joined the cast of the Showtime television drama Homeland, for which she received praise for her role as the conflicted wife of a former prisoner of war. On July 18, 2013, she was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series at the 2013 Primetime Emmy awards for her performance.

Baccarin became an advocate for women and girls, inspired by her mother's work for women’s rights in Brazil. In 2019, together with other artists, lawyers, advocates, and refugees, she took part in the Flores Exhibits project. She read the sworn testimony of a migrant child held in detention at the U.S.-Mexico border. In November 2011, Baccarin married American film producer and director Austin Chick.
