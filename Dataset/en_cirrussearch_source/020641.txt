Myron Waldman (April 23, 1908 – February 4, 2006) was an American animator, best known for his work at Fleischer Studios. Waldman was born in Brooklyn, New York on April 23, 1908. He was a graduate of the Pratt Institute, where he majored in Art. Waldman started his first work in 1930 at Fleischer Studio. At Fleischer he worked on Betty Boop, Raggedy Ann, Gulliver's Travels, the animated adaptations of Superman, and Popeye. He was head animator on two Academy Award-nominated shorts, Educated Fish (1937) and Hunky and Spunky (1939). Waldman made the transition when Fleischer Studios was acquired by Paramount Pictures and reorganized as Famous Studios in 1942. At Famous he worked mostly on the Casper the Friendly Ghost series. Waldman served three years in the U.S. Army (1939-1942). In 1943, Waldman partnered with writer Steve Carlin to produce the Happy the Humbug comic strip. In 1943, his wordless novel, one of the first, Eve: A Pictorial Love Story was a critical success. In 1957, he left Famous to become an animation director at Hal Seeger Productions where he worked on the revival of the Out of the Inkwell series, as well as Milton the Monster, until his retirement in 1968. In 1986 Waldman received the Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists Award, and in 1997 was given the Winsor McCay Award for his lifetime work in the field of animation. Waldman made limited edition cel, drawing characters on which he worked, Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman. Waldman met his wife, Rosalie, when she was an animation checker at the Fleischer Studio in the early 1940s, and had two sons, Robert and Steve. Waldman died of congestive heart failure on February 4, 2006, at the age of 97 at a hospital in Bethpage, New York. 1961: Cape Kidnaveral 1960: The Planet Mouseola with Jack Ehret 1958: Spook and Span with Wm.B.
