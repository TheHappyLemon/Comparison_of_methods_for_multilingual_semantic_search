The ER200 was a Soviet electric train built in Riga by Rīgas Vagonbūves Rūpnīca. It was the first high-speed Direct Current intercity Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) train with rheostatic brake. There were two designs. The first design, begun in 1974, was the ER200-1 EMU, and went into commercial operation in 1984. The second design went into operation between Saint Petersburg and Moscow in 1996.
