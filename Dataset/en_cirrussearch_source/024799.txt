Baranya (Hungarian: Baranya vármegye, pronounced [ˈbɒrɒɲɒ ˈvaːrmɛɟɛ]; German: Branau; Croatian: Baranjska županija) is a county (vármegye) in southern Hungary. It is part of the Southern Transdanubia statistical region and the historical Baranya region, which was a county (comitatus) in the Kingdom of Hungary dating back to the 11th century. Its current status as one of the 19 counties of Hungary was established in 1950 as part of wider Soviet administrative territorial reform following World War II. It is bordered by Somogy County to the northwest, Tolna County to the north, Bács-Kiskun County and the Danube to the east, and the border with Croatia (part of which is formed by the Drava River) to the south. As of the 2011 census, it had a population of 386,441 residents. Of the 19 counties of Hungary (excluding Budapest), it is ranked 10th, both in tems of geographic area and population. Its county seat and largest city is Pécs. In German, it is known as Komitat Branau, and in Croatian as Baranjska županija (Baranja). The county was probably named after its first comes 'Brana' or 'Braina'. This county has a total area of 4,430 km2 (1,710 sq mi) – 4.76% of Hungary – which is divided in Upper Baranya and Lower Baranya. The northern part of the county is a mountain area with large forests, the Mecsek Mountains. The central areas are shared between the Baranya Hills and Villány Mountains. The very eastern and southern parts are flat. The highest point in the county is Zengő in the Mecsek Mountains, at 682 metres. This is also the highest point of the mountain range. Baranya is rich in mineral and thermal water, and also in other resources. 98% of Hungary's coal resources are found here. Tolna County in the North. Bács-Kiskun County in the East. (across the Danube river) Croatia in the south (across the Drava river) – Osijek-Baranja County and Virovitica-Podravina County Somogy County in the Northwest. The climate of Baranya is a mix of continental and temperate, which makes it unique in Hungary, as the rest of the country is primarily continental. Its milder climate is due to its southern location and relative proximity to the Mediterranean Sea in comparison to other parts of the country, leaving it with warmer winters. It has the highest average annual rainfall of the Hungarian counties and a high amount of sunshine hours.[citation needed] The area has been inhabited since ancient times. Before the Hungarian tribes conquered the area, it was inhabited by Slavs and Avars. Stephen I founded an episcopal seat here. In 1526, the county was occupied by Ottomans and was freed in 1689. Its medieval borders remained unchanged until 1919. According to the peace treaty of Trianon, the southern part of the county (1,163 km2, 449 sq mi) reverted to Slavic rule (present-day Croatia). The re-organizing of the counties (1950) brought only minor changes (town of Szigetvár got there). Baranya has the largest number of minorities in Hungary (more than twice the country average), providing home to 34% of the German minority, the so-called Danube Swabians, and 32% of the Southern Slav minorities in Hungary. The Stifolder or Stiffoller Shvove are a Roman Catholic subgroup of the so-called Danube Swabians. Their ancestors once came ca. 1717 - 1804 from the Hochstift Fulda and surroundings (Roman Catholic Diocese of Fulda), and settled in Baranya. They retained their own German dialect and culture, until the end of WW2. After WW2, the majority of Danube Swabians were expelled to allied-occupied Germany and allied-occupied Austria, in accordance with the 1945 Potsdam Agreement. Only a few people can speak the old Stiffolerisch Schvovish dialect. Also a salami is named after these people.
