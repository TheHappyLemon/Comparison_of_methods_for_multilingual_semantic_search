Prior to the creation of the office of prime minister in 1876, Sweden did not have a head of government distinct from its head of state, the monarch, who traditionally held all executive authority. Louis De Geer, the architect of the bicameral Riksdag of 1866, which replaced the centuries-old Riksdag of the Estates, became Sweden's first prime minister in 1876. As of 2022[update], the prime minister of Sweden is Ulf Kristersson, leader of the Moderate Party. The list below contains statistics about the tenures of each of the prime ministers of Sweden since 1876. Before 1876, when the office of prime minister was created, Sweden did not have a head of government separate from the monarch. The most-senior member of the Privy Council during the period of absolute rule was the lord high chancellor, whose role was similar to that of a head of government. That was most evident during the so-called Age of Liberty, from 1718 to 1772, when the monarch's powers were greatly reduced and the president of the Privy Council became the dominant political figure in Sweden. The General Electoral League (1904–1938) was formed as a national campaign organisation for the early conservative and protectionist groups represented in the Riksdag. Parties affiliated with the organisation include the Lantmanna Party, the Protectionist Party and the National Party. The various parliamentary groups coalesced into a single party in 1935. The General Electoral League was renamed as the National Organisation of the Right (1938–1952) and the Rightist Party (1952–1969). The present name, Moderate Party, was adopted in 1969. The Liberal Coalition Party (1900–1924) was formed from the consolidation of various early liberal, centrist and pro-free trade politicians in the Riksdag. The party split on the issue of prohibition to form the Freeminded People's Party (1924–1934) and the Liberal Party of Sweden (1924–1934). The two parties later reconciled and merged resulting in the formation of the People's Party (1934–1990). The People's Party was renamed as the Liberal People's Party (1990–2015). The present name, Liberals, was adopted in 2015. The Social Democrats are officially named the Swedish Social Democratic Workers' Party. The Centre Party was formerly known as the Farmers' League (1913–1957). The present name was adopted in 1957. Former Prime Ministers are not counted twice in the numbering if they returned to power.
