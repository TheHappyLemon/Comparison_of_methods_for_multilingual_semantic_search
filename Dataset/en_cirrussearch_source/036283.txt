(See List of tournaments Archived 2016-10-05 at the Wayback Machine and List of world records in chess.) This section uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves. In 2009, Wang continued to compete in the FIDE Grand Prix 2008–2010, which was part of the World Chess Championship 2012 cycle.

He came joint 8th with 6/13 (+2−3=8) and a 2685 performance in the Category 19 (average 2716) event. All of his decisive games were with the white pieces; He lost to Ivanchuk, Adams and Radjabov, and had wins against Morozevich and Carlsen. In Round 2, he blundered early with 9.Na7?? in a what was to be a wild and scrappy game against Ivanchuk in an early deviation of the Queen's Gambit Declined: Wang–Ivanchuk 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Bg5 dxc4 5. Qa4+ Nbd7 6. Nc3 a6 7. g3 b5 8. Nxb5 Rb8 9. Na7?? A unexpected blunder. 9... Rb4 White must have missed this move. 10. Bxf6 gxf6 11. Qa5 Bb7 The knight on a7 is now trapped. 12.

This allows the black king to find safety, whereas 20.Qg4+ offered good chances of a perpetual check or 20.Qf7! Qc5 21.Rd1+ Kc6 22.0-0! would have allowed play to go on. 20... Ke8 21.

At the 26th Linares chess tournament (February 18 – March 8) Wang made his debut at the eight-player event and became the first ever Chinese player to participate. Wang finished with +1−2=11 in joint 5th to 7th place on 6½ points with Radjabov and Aronian, 5th on performance rating (2729), and sixth overall on tiebreak. He had his two losses to Grischuk and Anand, and a win over Carlsen. In 2009, Wang also participated at the 18th Amber Blindfold & Rapid tournament in Nice (March 14–26) in his debut event and as a second Chinese player (after Xie Jun in 1996), 5th M-Tel Masters in Sofia (May 12–23) (Topalov, Carlsen, Ivanchuk, Wang, Dominguez and Shirov) debut event and second Chinese player after Bu Xiangzhi in 2008, 22nd León Rapid León June 4–7, 4 player rapid with Ivanchuk, Morozevich, Carlsen; 20m+10s, the Russia v China match and the Maotai Prince Cup China National Chess King & Queen Championships.

At the FIDE World Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk, in November, Wang was the tenth seed, and defeated Nikolai Kabanov (2–0) and Boris Savchenko (2½–1½) before falling to Étienne Bacrot (1½–3½) in the third round playoff. His loss was notable in that both he and countryman Li Chao were forfeited from their respective playoff games for tardiness, as they were smoking outside the tournament hall and consequently arrived two minutes late for each player's second playoff game, warranting an automatic forfeiture by the FIDE regulations. In January 2010, he became China's first ever top 10 player on the FIDE rankings. From May 9–25, 2010, he participated in the final FIDE Grand Prix in Astrakhan, but failed to qualify for the Candidates Tournament for the World Chess Championship 2012.

In October, he played for the Russian team "Siberia" that won the European Chess Club Cup in Skopje. The following month Wang took clear first place in the 5th Chinese Rapid Masters Championship. Wang plays for Tianjin chess club in the China Chess League (CCL). Described as a highly technical, consistent and solid player he has a preference for the endgame where he seeks to slowly grind down his opponents with a slight advantage. In February 2009 after Corus finished, Teimour Radjabov was quoted in an interview saying, "[Wang Yue] does not allow his opponents to develop counterplay and he exerts "strangulation" style very effectively." Wang has said his childhood idol was José Raúl Capablanca, and once stated that Kramnik has had an influence on his style of play, having been impressed as a 13-year-old boy with Kramnik's victory over Kasparov in the London 2000 WCC match. Wang has been given the nickname "Panda" by chess columnist Mig Greengard. Wang usually plays 1.d4 as White, and for Black, plays the Sicilian, Berlin or Petroff against e4, and Slav against d4.
