Eduard Vorganov (born 7 December 1982) is a Russian professional road bicycle racer, who last rode for UCI Continental team Minsk Cycling Club. In 2012, Vorganov won the Russian National Road Race Championships. On 5 February 2016, he was suspended for a positive test of meldonium in a drug test conducted on 14 January. His provisional suspension was lifted in May 2016, as evidence emerged that athletes who had taken meldonium before January 1, the date the ban started, could have tested positive after the fact.
