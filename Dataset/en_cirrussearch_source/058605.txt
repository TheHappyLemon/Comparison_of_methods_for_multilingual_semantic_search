José Edmílson Gomes de Moraes (born 10 July 1976), known simply as Edmílson, is a Brazilian football executive and former professional footballer. He is currently a technical consultant for São Caetano. Either a defensive midfielder or a central defender, he played in three countries in his professional career, representing with team and individual success São Paulo, Lyon and Barcelona (four seasons each in the last two clubs). Having won 39 caps with Brazil, Edmílson represented the nation at the 2002 World Cup, helping it win the tournament. Born in Taquaritinga, São Paulo, Edmílson signed for São Paulo FC in 1995, winning two Campeonato Paulista titles during his spell. In 2000 he joined Olympique Lyonnais in France at the same time as compatriot Caçapa, also a stopper, both being important as the club won the League Cup in his first season. In the ensuing off-season, Juninho Pernambucano also made the move to the Rhône-Alpes, and often partnered Edmílson in central midfield as they went on to win three consecutive Ligue 1 titles. In July 2004, Edmílson signed with FC Barcelona for a reported €10 million. He made his La Liga debut on 19 September in a 1–1 away draw against Atlético Madrid, and finished his debut campaign with only six matches as the Catalans won the national championship; on 3 October, after having come on as a substitute for Samuel Eto'o during a home fixture against CD Numancia, he himself had to be substituted after only five minutes on the pitch, going on to be sidelined for several months due to injury. Edmílson recovered fully for 2005–06, collecting 41 appearances across all competitions, and playing an important part in Frank Rijkaard's team as they won the league and the season's UEFA Champions League. In the latter competition, he appeared in nine matches – six complete – including the first half of the final against Arsenal. After a poor 2007–08 campaign, both individually and collectively, and following the departure of he club's manager Rijkaard, 32-year-old Edmílson left Barcelona as his contract was not renewed. On 23 May 2008, Edmílson signed for one year with Villarreal CF. After only a couple of months, however, he returned to his country, joining Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras on a two-year deal and scoring his first goal in the first stage of the Copa Libertadores against Club Real Potosí, on 29 January 2009, just eight days after his arrival. After not having appeared in the São Paulo championship in 2010, Edmílson cut ties with Palmeiras and, on 31 January, returned to Spain, agreeing to a five-month contract with struggling Real Zaragoza – at that time, he was already the bearer of an Italian passport, thus not counting as a foreign player. He appeared regularly during the remainder of the campaign, as the Aragonese managed to finish out of the relegation zone, and saw his link being extended for another year. On 12 September 2010, Edmílson scored his first goal for Zaragoza, who lost 3–5 at home against Málaga CF. In June 2011, after having contributed with only 12 games to the club's final escape from relegation, he returned to his country and joined Ceará Sporting Club, where he remained until his retirement at the end of the year. Edmílson made his debut for the Brazil national team on 18 July 2000, against Paraguay. Selected to the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, he helped the Seleção win their fifth tournament, appearing in six out of seven games and scoring his first (and only) international goal in the 5–2 group stage win over Costa Rica. Originally selected to the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Edmílson was forced to withdraw from the squad after sustaining a knee injury in training before the tournament. Internationals goals An elegant and versatile defensive player, with good technique and flair, Edmílson normally played in a holding role in midfield during his time with Barcelona, but also played as a defender throughout his career; he was deployed both in central midfield and as a right-sided central defender during his time with Lyon, and as a centre-back in a back three with Brazil during the 2002 World Cup. Edmílson is a devout evangelical Christian, having converted when he was 16 years old.
