On 15 January 2015, Juric turned his back on a proposed $10 million move to Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua, opting to chase a move to Europe, where he believed he would have a better chance of staying involved with the Socceroos beyond the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.

He scored his only goal for the team on 12 September 2020, netting a late equalizer in the 1:1 away draw with Cherno More in a league match. His tenure at the club lasted for a little over a year, as he failed to get many opportunities to reveal his skills, in part due to injury problems. In June 2020, Juric tested positive for COVID-19. On 18 November 2020 the club confirmed that Juric had been released by mutual consent. On 26 November 2020, Juric returned to A-League club Adelaide United.
