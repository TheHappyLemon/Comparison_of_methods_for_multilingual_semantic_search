Antonee Robinson (born August 8, 1997), also nicknamed Jedi, is an American professional soccer player who plays as a left-back for Premier League club Fulham and the United States national team. Born in Milton Keynes, England, Robinson came through Everton's academy, having been with the academy since the age of 11. In June 2013, he signed a scholarship with the club, becoming a full-time player. While with Everton's U18 side, Robinson suffered injuries that saw him sidelined most of the time. He appeared for the U21 side toward the end of the 2014â€“15 season. As a result, he was awarded the club's Under-18 Players' Player of the Season. At the end of the 2014â€“15 season, he signed his first professional contract with the club after being offered a new contract. However, Robinson spent the most of the 2015â€“16 season sidelined by torn cartilage under his kneecap, resulting in knee surgery. Despite this, he signed a one-year contract extension on July 15, 2016. Robinson then played all three matches in the EFL Trophy, which saw Everton U23s eliminated in the Group stage. He also became a regular for the U23 side. At the end of the 2016â€“17 season, Robinson signed a two-year contract extension with the club. On August 4, 2017, it was announced that Antonee Robinson had signed on loan with Bolton Wanderers until January 2018. Five days after joining the club, on August 9, 2017, he made his debut in a 2â€“1 League Cup win at Crewe Alexandra. Two weeks later, on August 22, 2017, he set up a goal for Jem Karacan to score the club's third goal in a 3â€“2 win over Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup. He made his league debut for the side on September 9, 2017, in a 3â€“0 loss against Middlesbrough, playing the full 90 minutes. Robinson then established himself in the left-back position, beating out competition from Andrew Taylor. It was announced on January 5, 2018, that Robinson had agreed to stay at Bolton for the remainder of the season. On July 15, 2019, Robinson joined Wigan Athletic on a permanent three-year contract. He made his debut for Wigan against Rotherham United and scored his first goal for the club in a 2â€“2 draw at Millwall on November 26, 2019. After impressing for Wigan in the EFL Championship as one of the league's top left backs, Robinson was set to sign with Serie A side A.C. Milan for $13 million before the transfer deadline of January 31, 2020. However, the deal fell through when Robinson's medical examination at Milan revealed a heart rhythm irregularity for which further testing could not be completed before the deadline, and for which he would undergo an ablation procedure as treatment. Following Wigan's relegation from the Championship, Robinson moved to Premier League club Fulham on August 20, 2020, for Â£2 million. He made his debut for the club in a league cup game against Ipswich Town on September 16 in a Fulham win. He then played in the next round on September 23 against Sheffield Wednesday in 2â€“0 win. He played in the 3â€“0 loss to Brentford in the league cup on October 1. He made his Premier League debut on October 4 against Wolverhampton. He scored his first goal for the club in an EFL Cup tie against Birmingham City on August 24, 2021. In July 2023, he signed a new contract with Fulham until 2028. On December 3, 2023, Robinson made 13 interceptions in the 3â€“4 defeat to Liverpool, the most in a Premier League match since 2009. In the same game, he became the first American to record 3 consecutive assists in the Premier League. On December 20 in the 2023â€“24 EFL Cup quarter-final against Everton, Robinson forced an own-goal to get his side up 1â€“0 in the eventual 1â€“1 (7-6 penalties) win, helping his club to its first ever EFL semi-final appearance. Robinson was eligible for both England and the United States. He was born in Milton Keynes and raised in Liverpool, England. His father was born in England but raised in White Plains, New York and gained American citizenship. Robinson is also of Jamaican descent through his paternal grandmother. Robinson was first capped at under-18 level with the United States. He was also called into the United States under-20 side, although was not capped. In March 2018, Robinson was invited to both the United States senior and England under-21 camps, and accepted the United States senior call for a friendly against Paraguay in which he was named to the bench. He made his United States senior debut on May 28, 2018, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3â€“0 friendly win against Bolivia and recording an assist.
