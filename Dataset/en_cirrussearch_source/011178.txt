In 2011, Decker was cast as the female lead, Samantha Shane, an Admiral's daughter who works as a physical therapist, in the film Battleship, which was based on the board game of the same name.

She was also part of the ensemble cast of the comedy What to Expect When You're Expecting (2012), based on the book of the same name. She played the wife of Dennis Quaid's character.
