The 1969 Women's World Chess Championship was won by Nona Gaprindashvili, who successfully defended her title against challenger Alla Kushnir. This was the second of three consecutive title matches between the two strongest female players of their time. The Candidates Tournament was held in Subotica in September and October 1967. Unlike the previous tournament three years before, Kushnir won this one outright and again earned the right to challenge the reigning champion Gaprindashvili. The championship match was played in Tbilisi and Moscow in 1969. Once again, there was never really any doubt about who was the strongest of the two players.
