Ewert and The Two Dragons is an Estonian indie-rock band. The line-up consists of vocalist Ewert Sundja, guitarist Erki Pärnoja, drummer Kristjan Kallas, and bassist Ivo Etti. Their debut album The Hills Behind The Hills was released in 2009. The follow-up Good Man Down was recorded at the beginning of 2011 and was released in April on I Love You Records. The group's third album, Circles, was released in 2015 on Sire Records. They have gained recognition in the Baltic states as well as in several other European countries. Ewert Sundja, Erki Pärnoja and Kristjan Kallas are friends who first started playing together in 2008. The band name came from a movie that Sundja was a fan of. After a while the band got used to it and decided to stick with it. Although the name states that there are three people in the group, the band describes one of the dragons to have two heads. For the first concerts, they mostly played covers of The Police, Radiohead, Jeff Buckley and others. Soon the trio decided to use their own material which resulted in the release of their debut album The Hills Behind the Hills. The album was recorded in three days at the summer cottage of Ewert Sundja's in-laws and was released in October 2009. When they started to perform live, Ivo Etti joined the line-up. In May 2010, the band started their first Baltic tour and gave concerts across the Baltics — in Riga, Sigulda, Liepaja and Klaipeda. In May 2010, the band was the opening act of TEDxTallinn conference. On 17 July 2010, the band gave a concert at the Positivus. On 25 September, the band signed a record deal with Latvian indie label I Love You Records. Second album Good Man Down was released on 5 April 2011 and it has since then received critical acclaim in Estonia, Latvia, Finland, France and Sweden. The album was one of the best-selling records in Estonia in 2011. The first single off the album, "(In The End) There's Only Love" was popular in all three Baltic countries and became a breaking point in the band's career. It was premiered in Estonia by Mart Normet on Raadio 2 and in Latvia by Toms Grevins from Radio 101. The track was picked up by Estonian commercial radio stations in mid-2011 and peaked Uuno Radio Top 25 chart in September. Renārs Kaupers from Brainstorm mentioned his fondness for the group in many of his interviews and in August 2011 Ewert and The Two Dragons played the song together with Brainstorm at the Freedom Song event at the Tallinn Song Festival Grounds. Since 2011, Ewert and The Two Dragons have performed in various European countries, also at the festivals like Popkomm (Germany), Waves Vienna (Austria), Eurosonic Festival 2012 (Holland) and Lost In Music (Finland). In November 2011, they had sold out shows at the Nokia Concert Hall in Tallinn and Palladium in Riga.
