Although Beck stands only 1.58 m (5 ft 2 in) tall, she was a strong skier, but was renowned for her shooting ability: she was regularly among the female athletes with the highest accuracy rate, leading the shooting statistics in the 2003–04 season with a rate of 89 percent. Her father attributed her shooting ability to family inheritance: he had won multiple divisional shooting championships, and he noted that his father was also a good marksman. She became a member of the German World Cup team in 2000, when she impressed by winning an event in her first year and even finished third in the mass start World Cup standings. Later, she became the first German biathlete to win the women's Biathlon World Cup in the 2002–03 season, alongside the pursuit World Cup; in 2005–06, she finished third in the overall standings and won the mass start standings. In 2007–08, she was the best biathlete in the individual discipline. As of 17 March 2008, she has won a total of 12 individual world cup events. During the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Beck won three silver medals: one in the sprint competition, one in the pursuit, and one in the relay.
