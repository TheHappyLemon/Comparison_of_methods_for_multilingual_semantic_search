Deception Station (Spanish: Base Decepción) is an Argentine antarctic base located at Deception Island, South Shetland Islands. The station was founded on January 25, 1948, and was a year-round station until December 1967 when volcanic eruptions forced the evacuation of the base. Since then it is inhabited only during the summer. The island suffered severe volcanic eruptions in 1967, 1969 and 1970. In 1950 a seismograph was installed in the base, and in 1951 it also received ionospheric equipment. In 1993 a volcano observatory was opened.
