Rosendo Carreon Balinas Jr. (September 10, 1941 – September 24, 1998) was a chess grandmaster from the Philippines. FIDE awarded him the International Master title in 1975 and the International Grandmaster title in 1976. He was Philippines' second chess grandmaster. Balinas was a lawyer by profession, as well as an award winning chess writer and journalist. He also unsuccessfully ran for representative of Rizal's 1st district in the 1994 special election. This section uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves. Balinas was considered the strongest Asian player during the 1960s and 1970s, before the emergence of compatriot Eugenio Torre. Balinas won international chess tournaments in Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, and Odessa, USSR during the period. At the 1966 17th Chess Olympiad in Havana, Cuba, Balinas scored 15½ points out of 20 games (.775) and was awarded the individual silver medal award, behind gold medalist, former world champion Mikhail Tal, who scored 11 points out of 13 games (.846). In the 1967 Meralco "Beat Bobby Fischer" match series in Manila, of the top 10 Filipino players, Balinas was the only then Philippine national master to hold the future world champion to a draw: R. C. Balinas – R. J. Fischer, Manila 1967.

He defended his title and shared first place at the Meralco-sponsored 1968 Philippine Open championship with world championship candidate Yugoslav grandmaster Svetozar Gligorić. In 1975, then-IM Balinas achieved a 5-5 score at the Manila Marlboro Classic International Chess Tournament, one-half point short of the grandmaster norm, tying with Gligoric for 6th-7th place. Balinas defeated world championship candidates Lev Polugaevsky of USSR and Bent Larsen of Denmark, as well as the Czech-American grandmaster Lubomir Kavalek. Balinas achieved his greatest victory at the 1976 Odessa International Tournament, winning with a 10–4 score. Balinas was undefeated against all Soviet opponents, and a point ahead of Lev Alburt, and former Soviet champion Vladimir Savon. Bobby Ang, a Philippine chess columnist of Indo Chess and Philippine Business World, recounted in his Chess Piece column: "Vladimir Savon, the Absolute Russian Chess champion pre-tournament favorite, had been upset in the second round by Tseitlin and it was Balinas who jumped into the lead scoring 5/6. Savon gave chase and three rounds before the end of the tournament the two leaders met. The Philippine Chess Champion Balinas' decisive win over the Soviet Champion was considered to be the turning point of the tournament. Balinas, Rosendo Carreon, Philippines (2365) – Savon, Vladimir A USSR (2545) Odessa, USSR, 1976.

Balinas thereby became the first foreign player to win an international tournament in the Soviet Union since World Chess Champion José Raúl Capablanca's win in Moscow, 1936 and GM Reuben Fine's wins in Leningrad, 1937 and Moscow, 1937. Balinas' remarkable accomplishment brought great honor to his country, the Philippines, a nation that is sorely in need of heroes." As a result of his victory in Odessa, FIDE awarded Balinas the International Chess Grandmaster title. Another of Bobby Ang's excellent article and analysis of Balinas' "invigorating upset win" over GM Ludek Pachman a former Czechoslovakian champion who emigrated and played for Germany during the 1976 Haifa Olympiad.
