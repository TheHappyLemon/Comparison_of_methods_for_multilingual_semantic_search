2 Alive (stylized as 2 Alivë) is the second studio album by American rapper Yeat. It was released on February 18, 2022, by Geffen Records, Interscope Records, Field Trip Recordings, Listen To The Kids and Twizzy Rich. The album features guest appearances from Young Thug, Gunna, Yung Kayo, Ken Carson, and SeptembersRich. The album was supported by one single, "Still Countin", which was released on February 11, 2022. The deluxe edition, titled 2 Alive (Geek Pack), was released on April 1, 2022, with additional guest appearances by Lil Uzi Vert and Lancey Foux. Yeat initially announced a January 2022 release date but delayed it to wait for an additional feature. On March 16, Yeat announced a supporting tour for the album, which included dates from April 8 to May 9. 2 Alive sold 35,000 album-equivalent units in the first week, debuting at number 6 on the US Billboard 200 chart. It is Yeat's first US top-ten album. In a positive review, David Aaron Brake of HipHopDX wrote that "though he didn't expand beyond the sounds of his previous work, Yeat's latest is a master class in precision and knowing what the audience craves. Excellent rap need not always be grand in scope: 2 Alivë proves success can come just as easily through zooming in". In a mixed review, Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork wrote that "the 21-year-old Portland rapper isn't doing anything all that new, but he has a refreshing album-focused approach, best listened to as one continuous stream, getting lost in the noisy madness". Writing for AllMusic, David Crone felt that the album's 20-song track list is "undeniably bloated, padded out with some fairly one-dimensional material". Notes Any song title that contains the letter 'e' is replaced with 'ë'. For example, "Rackz Got Me" is stylized as "Rackz Got Më". If a song contains two or more 'e's, then the first one is only replaced. ^[a] signifies an uncredited co-producer Joe LaPorta – mastering Noah Smith – mixing, recording "Yeat Enlists Young Thug, Gunna, Ken Car$on, & More On "2 Alive"".
