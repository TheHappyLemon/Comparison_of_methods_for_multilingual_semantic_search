James Kottak (December 26, 1962 – January 9, 2024) was an American drummer, best known for his work with the German hard rock band Scorpions, which he joined in 1996. At the time of his firing from the band in 2016, he was their longest-serving drummer. Kottak was also an original member of Kingdom Come, of whom he was their drummer from 1987 to 1989 and again from 2018 to his death in 2024, and he had his own band Kottak, formerly known as KrunK. Other bands Kottak played for were Montrose, Warrant, Wild Horses, the McAuley Schenker Group, and Buster Brown. Prior to joining Scorpions, Kottak was a drummer for Nuthouse, the Bob Brickley Band, Mister Charlie, Buster Brown, Montrose, Kingdom Come, Wild Horses, the McAuley Schenker Group, Warrant, and Ashba. As a teenager in Louisville, he had a strong local presence in several live bands, including the fusion group Nuthouse, which also featured his Durrett High School bandmate Don Braden (later a world-renowned jazz saxophonist). He earned a music scholarship from the University of Louisville. Kottak gained early mainstream exposure during his time with Kingdom Come, appearing on the band's first two studio albums, the first of which included their biggest hit, "Get It On". This track prominently features Kottak's drumming, culminating in a drum solo just before the song's conclusion. Around 1990, Kottak joined The Cult, but left after the first batch of demos for their then-upcoming fifth studio album Ceremony, in which the album's drum tracks were done by Mickey Curry. In February 1997, he joined Dio on their U.S. tour by filling in for Vinny Appice for four or five shows when the latter had pneumonia. He also gave drum lessons at Far-Out Music in Jeffersonville, Indiana, once having onetime Bride drummer, Jerry McBroom as a student. He also played with guitarist Michael Lee Firkins. Kottak also played in his own band Kottak, formerly known as KrunK. Kottak was one of the contributors to the book Sex Tips from Rock Stars by Paul Miles published by Omnibus Press in July 2010. On April 28, 2016, it was announced that Kottak would be replaced by Mikkey Dee on 12 North American headlining dates, including a run of shows at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas dubbed "Scorpions blacked out in Las Vegas". On September 12, 2016, it was announced that Kottak was no longer in the band. Kottak endorsed Ddrum and Yamaha drums, Aquarian drumheads, Zildjian Cymbals, Ahead drumsticks and accessories and Danmar percussion. Kottak was married to Athena Bass, Tommy Lee's younger sister, who is also a drummer and was a fellow member of Kottak. The couple had three children between them, including their son, Matthew, and Athena's two children from two prior relationships. On April 29, 2014, the National Post reported via the Associated Press that Kottak had been arrested in Dubai and sentenced to one month in jail for offensive behavior, insulting Islam, and public drunkenness. On September 12, 2016, he was fired from Scorpions for his alcoholism, and would later work on his recovery. After his dismissal from the Scorpions, Kottak came out publicly about his politically conservative views. In June 2019, Kottak said, "I wrote a new song.... 'Get out of My Kountry' ie: stay out of my space! We don't need anymore outsiders. We can't even fix the homeless problems?! When homeless problem is solved we take care everyone else..." On October 15, 2019, Kottak went on Twitter and stated, "You know I am sick of every other commercial having inter racial couples...this is not reality. It is Hollywood shoving it down our throat. I don't have one friend or friends who live in this category...just saying". On November 26, 2019, Kottak went on to say that "OK so the percentage of black Americans in the U.S. is about 13% so why are they represented 50 to 60% on all commercials? Just saying call me out if you have a reasonable argument?". A short time later, he added: "Maybe none of you have any balls to speak the truth?" On January 9, 2024, Kottak was found dead in his bathroom at his home in Louisville, Kentucky, at the age of 61. His exact cause of death is unknown as of yet. However, heavy metal news source Metal Sludge stated that his cause of death was believed to be apparent cardiac arrest.
