Nikolay Nikolayevich Nosov (Russian: Николай Николаевич Носов, Ukrainian: Микола Миколайович Носов; 23 November [O.S. 10 November] 1908 – 26 July 1976) was a Soviet writer of children's literature, the author of a number of humorous short stories, a school novel, and the popular trilogy of fairy tale novels about the adventures of Dunno and his friends. He was born in a family of an estrada artist. From 1927 to 1929 he was a student of Kyiv Institute of Art, from where he moved to Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography, from which he graduated in 1932. The literary debut of Nosov was in 1938. In 1932 – 1951 he worked as a producer of animated and educational films, including ones for the Red Army, having earned the Order of the Red Star in 1943. In 1938 Nosov began to publish his stories, including Zatejniki (Russian: Затейники, roughly translates as Jokers); Alive Hat, Cucumbers, Miraculous Trousers, and Dreamers. These stories were published mainly in the magazine for children Murzilka and many of them make up the foundation of the Nosov's first collection Rat-tat-tat, 1945). Nosov introduced a new hero, naïve and sensible, naughty and curious fidget obsessed by craving for activities and always getting into unusual, often comic situations – into children's literature. The most popular works became his stories for teenagers Merry Family (1949), The Kolya Sinitsyn's Diary (1950), Vitya Maleev at School and at Home (1951). This last one received Stalin Prize in 1952.
