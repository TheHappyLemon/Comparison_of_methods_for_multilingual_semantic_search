The two clubs could have started new negotiations after the season ended; Milivojević stated that his wish was to make the move permanent. According to reports in Belgium, Olympiacos were to meet Anderlecht's asking price in order to complete the permanent transfer of Milivojević. Olympiacos were in negotiations with the Belgian club as they were reluctant to pay the €2.7 million Anderlecht asked for Milivojević. On 4 June 2015, Anderlecht confirmed that it had reached an agreement with Olympiacos for the permanent transfer of Milivojević. He had spent a season with the club, and joined the Greek champions by signing a four-year contract, for a fee of €2.3 million.

In 2017–18, Milivojević was Palace's top scorer with 10 goals as the Eagles recovered from a poor start to the season to finish 11th under new manager Roy Hodgson. He developed a reputation for taking penalties, scoring nine of the ten he took in his first 11⁄2 seasons with Palace; he had never taken a penalty in a professional match prior to joining Crystal Palace. The one he did miss was on 31 December 2017 in added time at the end of a goalless draw against Manchester City, with Ederson making a save for the team who had won their last 18 matches. On 28 October 2018, Milivojević scored two penalties in a 2–2 home draw with Arsenal, ending the visitors' run of 12 consecutive victories.
