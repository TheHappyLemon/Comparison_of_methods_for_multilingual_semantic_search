Lusha chose poetry as the subject matter for her children's book because, "While some mothers sing lullabies to their children, my mother read me poetry," she said. "And to this day, I associate my strongest and most insistent feelings with words lyrically organized on a page." In 2016, Lusha released her fourth book of poetry, The Living Air. In an interview, Lusha revealed that she completed her novel, The Besa, in one month, writing from 6 am until 8 pm every day while forgetting to eat.
