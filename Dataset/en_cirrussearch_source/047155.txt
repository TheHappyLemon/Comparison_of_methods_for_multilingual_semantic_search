The explanation of the name of the concert hall is - "Vidzeme" stands for the regional status of the institution. "Concert hall" represents its multifunctionality, but "Cēsis" represents the location of the concert hall. The Vidzeme Concert Hall Cēsis was built to fill the need for academic music, theatre, opera, ballet etc., for the citizens of Cesis region. It was originally planned to build a separate building for the concert hall and to leave the Houses of the Viceroy Society (Latvian Cēsu Viesīgās Biedrības nams), which served as a cultural centre since 1915, for theatre performances. It was eventually decided to reconstruct the building. The concert hall was designed by the architect Juris Poga in 2007[8] whose previous work includes the reconstruction of the Mežaparks Great Bandstand (Latvian: Mežaparka Lielā estrāde) from 2016 till 2018.

The Concert Hall Cēsis is owned by Cēsis Municipality and LLC “Vidzemes koncertzāle” manages the building. The concert hall is a six-storey building. Exposed materials are seen all over the new facade – brick wall, natural stone, wood, concrete, metal. In contrast to that, old construction technique – painted wall plaster, was kept in parts of the historic building. The building includes wood shields of the entrance lobby walls, great hall chandeliers with ceiling rosettes, metal railings of the old stairs, lobby pillars, as well as the only remaining door from 1914. The shutters of the concert hall are made of metal instead of wood, as it was planned at the beginning, to ensure long-term exploitation. The shutters serve as natural shaders and design elements. The location and colour of the shutters admit the concept of the building – to create a wood symbol to the new building. The location of the shutters is designed like foliage - with a thicker or smaller crown. The colour of the shutters changes in different lighting during day time.
