Canaima National Park Coro University City of Caracas The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela accepted the convention on 30 October 1990. There are three World Heritage Sites in the country, with a further three on the tentative list. The first site in Venezuela added to the list was Coro and its Port, in 1993. The site has been listed as endangered since 2005 because of the damage caused by heavy rains in the previous year and because of new constructions that threaten the integrity of the property. The most recent site listed was the Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas, in 2000. Coro and the Ciudad Universitaria are cultural sites while the Canaima National Park, listed in 1994, is a natural site. UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.   † In danger In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Venezuela lists three properties on its tentative list.
