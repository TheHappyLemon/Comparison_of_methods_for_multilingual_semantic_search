Sanok County (Polish: powiat sanocki) is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Subcarpathian Voivodeship, south-eastern Poland, on the Slovak border. It came into being on January 1, 1999, as a result of the Polish local government reforms passed in 1998. Its administrative seat and largest town is Sanok, which lies 56 kilometres (35 mi) south of the regional capital Rzeszów. The only other town in the county is Zagórz, lying 6 km (4 mi) south-east of Sanok. The county covers an area of 1,225.12 square kilometres (473.0 sq mi). As of 2019 its total population is 94,473, out of which the population of Sanok is 37,381, that of Zagórz is 5,095, and the rural population is 51,997. Sanok County is bordered by Krosno County to the west, Brzozów County to the north, Przemyśl County to the north-east and Lesko County to the east. It also borders Slovakia to the south. The county is subdivided into eight gminas (one urban, one urban-rural and six rural). These are listed in the following table, in descending order of population. About 60% of the land surface of County is given over to agricultural use. However, very little of this is arable land; the vast majority consists of permanent grass pasture or rough grazing for herd animals such as sheep and cows. Although both beef and dairy cattle are raised widely, especially in Odrzechowa, County is more well known for its sheep farming, and thus lamb is the meat traditionally associated with Polish cooking.
