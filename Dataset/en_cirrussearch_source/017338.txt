The district is rich in beautiful nature and could become a tourist destination. However, the geographic location is very inconvenient. Zarasai district municipality is away from major highways. Also, it is quite far away from the capital, Vilnius. Vilnians would rather choose numerous lakes in Molėtai district municipality or Aukštaitija National Park for recreation. The district has many hill forts built in the 9-12th centuries. They were used for defence against Livonian Order attacking from Daugavpils. Stelmužė Oak, the oldest tree in Lithuania, grows in the district. Smalvas Stelmužė Oak Landscape near Turmantas "Gyventojai gyvenamosiose vietovese". osp.stat.gov.lt (in Lithuanian).
