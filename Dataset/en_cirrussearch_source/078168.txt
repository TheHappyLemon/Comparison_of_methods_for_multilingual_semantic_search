"Feuer frei!" (German pronunciation: [ˈfɔʏɐ ˈfʁaɪ]) is a song by German industrial metal band Rammstein. The song was released as the fifth single from their third album Mutter. The title is from the command to start shooting in German military language (literally "fire freely!") and can be compared to "fire at will" or "open fire". "Feuer frei!" is one of the band's most well known songs. Despite this, it does not feature on the band's greatest hits collection Made in Germany 1995–2011, for reasons that have not been explained. The song is featured in the film xXx and during the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode "Slaves of Las Vegas". The UK "Feuer frei!" single was released in three parts (2 CDs, 1 DVD), in three different colors (Yellow-Green-Orange), each with different track listings. "Feuer frei!" debuted live in a concert exclusively for members of the fan area in April 2000, when it was called "Punk". Its next performance was not until May 2001 (this being the album version), and it has been played in almost every Rammstein concert since then. During live performances of this song Richard Kruspe, Paul Landers, Till Lindemann and sometimes Oliver Riedel will wear masks with flamethrowers attached that shoot flames several metres into the air. The video was directed by Rob Cohen who also directed the film xXx. The video for "Feuer frei!" was released in America on MTV, to promote the film. The music video consisted of the band playing on a fiery stage, with several clips from the film. In addition, Rammstein is featured playing the song in a club in Prague in the film's opening.
