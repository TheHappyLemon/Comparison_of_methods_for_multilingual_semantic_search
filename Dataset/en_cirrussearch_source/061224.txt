Zavodske (Ukrainian: Заводське́, pronounced [zɐwod͡zʲˈsʲkɛ]) is a city in Myrhorod Raion, Poltava Oblast, Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Zavodske urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 7,712 (2022 estimate). Founded in 1928, until 1962 it was known as Stalinka before changing to Chervonozavodske (Ukrainian: Червонозаводське, Russian: Краснозаводское). It was the site of a large World War II tank battle involving the 2nd SS Panzer Division.[citation needed] Following the 2015 law on decommunization the city was renamed early February 2016 to its current name Zavodske. The city is located on the terraces of the left bank of the Sula River in the forest-steppe zone of the Dnieper lowland in the north of the Poltava region - 12 km from the regional center of Lokhvitsa and 160 km from the city of Poltava. Until 18 July 2020, Zavodske belonged to Lokhvytsia Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Poltava Oblast to four. The area of Lokhvytsia Raion was merged into Myrhorod Raion. Two secondary schools Vocational school № 32 Lokhvitsky College of Mechanics and Technology of the Poltava State Agrarian Academy.
