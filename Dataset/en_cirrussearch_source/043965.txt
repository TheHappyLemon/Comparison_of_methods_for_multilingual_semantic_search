Ryan Dominic Bertrand (born 5 August 1989) is an English professional footballer who last played as a left-back for EFL Championship club Leicester City. Bertrand began his youth career at Gillingham, before signing for Chelsea in July 2005. He graduated from Chelsea's youth system and was sent on loan to various clubs between 2006 and 2010. He made his full debut for Chelsea on in April 2011, six years after joining them, in a fixture against Birmingham City. In the 2011–12 season, Bertrand signed a new four-year contract with Chelsea and was made understudy to Ashley Cole. In May 2012, Bertrand became the first player to make his Champions League debut in the final, starting in an unfamiliar left wing role in front of Cole; Chelsea beat Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties. After going on loan to Southampton in the 2014–15 season, Bertrand signed permanently for them in 2015. During seven seasons with the club, he appeared 240 times. In 2021, he moved to Leicester City where he played infrequently during his two seasons with the club. Bertrand is an England international, having also represented 'the Young Lions' at under-17, under-18, under-19, under-20, under-21 levels, as well as Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

He joined Gillingham aged nine, progressing through their youth system. Bertrand attended the Robert Napier School in Gillingham, Kent. Bertrand was signed by Chelsea in July 2005 from Gillingham for an initial £125,000, which was set by a tribunal and was subject to increases depending on progress. During the 2006–07 season, he was twice sent on loan to AFC Bournemouth, at the same time as Chelsea teammate Jack Cork. He suffered a ruptured spleen in a youth team match against Arsenal that ruled him out of the later part of that season. In August 2007, Bertrand joined Oldham Athletic on loan until January 2008. On 4 January 2008, a matter of days after his spell at Oldham came to an end, Bertrand joined Norwich City on loan for the rest of the 2007–08 season. He put in a number of impressive displays playing at both left-back and on the left wing, and admitted he would welcome a longer stay with the club.[citation needed] Bertrand became popular with the Carrow Road crowd earning him the nickname 'Plastic' in reference to the Belgian singer Plastic Bertrand. On 4 July 2008, he rejoined the club on loan until January 2009, with an option to extend to the end of the season. On 17 July 2009, Bertrand joined Reading on a season-long loan.

On 5 August 2010, Bertrand signed on loan with Championship club Nottingham Forest in an initial six-month deal. He made his debut for Forest as a substitute in a 1–0 away defeat against Burnley.[citation needed] He was a regular for Forest for whom he made a total of 19 appearances.[citation needed] Forest were interested in either extending Bertrand's loan spell for the rest of the season or to sign him permanently but when his loan period expired on 3 January 2011 he returned to his parent club Chelsea.[citation needed] Bertrand made his Premier League debut on 20 April 2011, when he came on as substitute to replace Ashley Cole in a 3–1 win against Birmingham City.

The match finished in favour of Chelsea, who won on penalties 4–3, as the match ended goalless.

His second goal for the club came on 26 December, in a 3–1 victory over Crystal Palace. On 1 February 2015, he was given a straight red card at the end of a 0–1 home loss against Swansea City for a foul on Modou Barrow.

Bertrand has represented England youth teams at under-17, under-18, under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels.[citation needed] He was part of the U19 squad at the 2008 European Championship.[citation needed] He was promoted to the U21s and called up for several 2009 European Championship qualifiers, but missed out of the squad for the final tournament.[citation needed] On 14 November, Stuart Pearce selected him at left-back for an under-21 match against Portugal at Wembley in Group 9 of the qualification process, and helped the team keep first clean sheet since 29 June 2009.[citation needed] He was named in the England under-21 squad for the 2011 European Championship and played all matches. On 2 July 2012, Bertrand was named in Stuart Pearce's 18-man squad for the 2012 Summer Olympics. He played his first match for Great Britain on 20 July 2012 in a friendly match against Brazil.

On 11 September 2012, Bertrand came on after 73 minutes in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Ukraine and crossed the ball that led to the penalty that Frank Lampard converted.

Bertrand was part of the squad for UEFA Euro 2016. On 1 September 2017, Bertrand scored his first goal for England in a 4–0 World Cup qualifier win over Malta. Bertrand has been described as a modern-day full-back who gives assistance in attacking down the flanks, keeping and retaining possession as well as defending and reclaiming possession, making quick runs into the box and often does one-two's with his teammates.[citation needed] Bertrand was described by Glenn Roeder, his manager at Norwich, as a defender who "likes to bomb forward and is tenacious in the tackle when defending." In a 2018 ESPN FC article about the state of left-backs in England, Michael Cox said that the "only real star is Ryan Bertrand, a truly excellent full-back defensively and offensively".
