Gerald Earl Gillum (born May 24, 1989), better known by his stage name G-Eazy, is an American rapper and record producer. Based in Oakland, California, he began his career in 2006 and released two independent studio albums until signing with RCA Records to release his third album, These Things Happen (2014). It reached number three on the US Billboard 200, while its single, "I Mean It" (featuring Remo) received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and marked his first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. His fourth album, When It's Dark Out (2015) was met with similar success and preceded by the single "Me, Myself & I" (with Bebe Rexha), which peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100. His fifth album, The Beautiful & Damned (2017) saw continued success and matched These Things Happen on the Billboard 200. It was led by the single "No Limit" (featuring Cardi B and ASAP Rocky), which peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains his highest-charting song. His sixth album, These Things Happen Too (2021) peaked at number 19 on the Billboard 200 and contained the mildly-charting singles "Hate the Way" (featuring blackbear) and "Provide" (featuring Chris Brown and Mark Morrison).
