She was born in Vaide (Livonian: Vaid) within the Bertholds family, relevant in the history of the Livonians. She was a relative of Viktors Bertholds, who died in 2009 and for a long time had been believed to be the last speaker of Livonian. After Kristiņa's death, a process for reviving the Livonian language was started. Šuvcāne, Baiba (8 June 2013). "Pēdējais sveiciens dzimtajam Lībiešu krastam..." Talsu Vēstis (in Latvian).
