The International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI, short for Fédération Internationale de la Presse Cinématographique) is an association of national organizations of professional film critics and film journalists from around the world for "the promotion and development of film culture and for the safeguarding of professional interests." It was founded in June 1930 in Brussels, Belgium. It has members in more than 50 countries worldwide. In reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIPRESCI announced that it will not participate in festivals and other events organized by the Russian government and its offices, and canceled a colloquium in St. Petersburg, that was to make it familiar with new Russian films. The FIPRESCI often presents awards during film festivals to recognize examples of enterprising filmmaking. Some of these festivals include: the Berlin International Film Festival, the Cannes Film Festival, Vienna International Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, the Warsaw Film Festival, and the International Film Festival of Kerala) Winners of the award include: Adoor Gopalakrishnan Arun Karthick Aki Kaurismäki Abbas Kiarostami Antoni Krauze Aditya Kripalani Akira Kurosawa Abderrahmane Sissako Andrei Tarkovsky Andrzej Wajda Bahman Ghobadi Béla Tarr Bertrand Bonello Bruno Jori Cristian Mungiu Claire Denis Danis Tanović Djibril Diop Mambety Jafar Panahi Jean-Luc Godard Jonathan Glazer Julia Ducournau Kim Ki-duk Ken Loach Ingmar Bergman Laurent Cantet Lee Chang-dong Makbul Mubarak Manav Kaul Manoel de Oliveira Marco Ferreri Michael Haneke Michael Moore Neeraj Ghaywan Nobuhiko Obayashi Nuri Bilge Ceylan Orson Welles Paul Thomas Anderson Pedro Almodóvar Prateek Vats Rainer Werner Fassbinder Robert Eggers Roman Polanski Satyajit Ray Shaji N Karun Srđan Karanović Terrence Malick Theodoros Angelopoulos Uisenma Borchu Werner Herzog Woody Allen Wong Kar-wai Wuershan Robert Bresson refused this award at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival.[citation needed] The FIPRESCI Grand Prix was created in 1999, and is presented every year at the San Sebastián Film Festival.
