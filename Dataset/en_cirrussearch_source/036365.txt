Leptis Magna Sabratha Cyrene Tadrart Acacus Ghadames The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Libya accepted the convention on 13 October 1978. There are five World Heritage Sites in Libya, with a further three on the tentative list. The first three sites in Libya were added to the list in 1982 and the most recent one in 1986. All five sites are listed due to their cultural significance. Since 2016, all five sites have been listed as endangered because of the instability due to the Libyan civil war. UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.   † In danger "The World Heritage Convention". UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Archived from the original on 27 August 2016.
