Wet Dream is the debut solo album by Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright, released in 1978. Wet Dream was self-produced and Wright wrote all the songs himself, except "Pink's Song", which was co-written with his then-wife, Juliette, who, as Juliette Gale, had provided vocals to a pre-Pink Floyd song "Walk with Me Sydney". Wet Dream was recorded at Super Bear Studios, Alpes-Maritimes, in early 1978, the same studio where bandmate David Gilmour would record his eponymous solo album just weeks after the recording of Wet Dream. The album went virtually unnoticed at the time. The album has long been out of print in Wright's native UK, but it was re-released on CD in the United States and Canada in the 1990s, with some success, and again in 2008 in Australia, following Wright's death. The album was announced for a CD and digital re-issue on 28 July 2023, which would have been Wright's 80th birthday. It features a new stereo mix by Steven Wilson and new artwork with previously unseen photos from the period. The new stereo mix was released on vinyl and on BD, which also includes multi-channel Dolby Atmos and 5.1 surround sound mixes by Wilson on 29 September 2023, the album's 45th anniversary. The 2023 reissues originally did not include the original 1978 mix of the album, but after fan feedback a flat transfer pre-master of the original mix was added to the Blu-ray edition. On 28 June 2023 "Cat Cruise" was released as a digital single to promote the reissue. The 2023 reissue CD credits Juliette Wright with the lyrics for "Pink's Song"; This was the case on the original album (back cover) credits but on the disc itself she was erroneously credited with the lyrics to "Against the Odds". All tracks are written by Richard Wright, except Pink's Song, composed by Wright, containing lyrics by Juliette Wright. Credits taken from original 1978 album and the 2023 reissue.
