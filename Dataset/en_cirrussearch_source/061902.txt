The Pedvāle Open Air Art Museum (Latvian: Pedvāles Brīvdabas mākslas muzejs) is a State Historical Monument near Sabile, Talsi Municipality, Latvia. It was founded in 1992 by Ojārs Arvīds Feldbergs as a setting for environmental art. The museum preserves the cultural landscape of the Abava River valley. The museum has a permanent collection of more than 150 outdoor sculptures by an international group of artists. It was the site of the 7th International Conference on Contemporary Cast Iron Art in 2014. The park is said to be the residence of the White Princess, a Latvian ghost. She is more often felt than seen, and it said to draw people to come back, or to stay at Pedvāle. The park contains native Latvian plants and animals, to fulfill its mission to preserve the scenic landscapes of the Abava Valley. Blooming wildflowers include lupins, which are in bloom for the summer solstice. Amimals include the hedgehog, Eurasian beaver, and deer. Birds include the stork and cuckoo. 03 The museum shared the UNESCO award for preservation and development of the cultural landscape in 1999. In 1999 the activities at Pedvāle museum were recognized and awarded the UNESCO Melina Mercuri International Prize for the Safeguarding and Management of Cultural Landscapes.
