Krasnoperekopsk (Russian: Красноперекопск) or Yany Kapu (Ukrainian: Яни Капу, Crimean Tatar: Yañı Qapu) is a town in Crimea. Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea, it was incorporated into Russia's Republic of Crimea. However, a majority of countries recognises the territory as part of Ukraine within the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. It is the administrative center of Krasnoperekopsk Raion. Administratively is not a part of the raion (district) and is incorporated separately as a town of regional significance. Population: 26,268 (2014 Census). It is located on the southern part of the Perekop Isthmus, on the shore of the Stare Lake [uk], and about 124 kilometres (77 mi) from the Crimean capital, Simferopol. It lies on the Dzhankoy-Kherson railroad line (one of the two railroad lines connecting the Crimea and the rest of the continent). The city was founded as Bromzavod[citation needed] (Russian: Бромзавод) in 1932 as an industrial settlement for the bromine factory constructed near the Stare Lake [uk] (Crimean Tatar name: Tuzla gölü, Тузла голю, Lake Tuzla, "Salty lake"). In 1936, the settlement became known as Krasno-Perekopsk (Красно-Перекопск) in honor of the Bolshevik-siding forces who stormed Perekop in 1920. In 1964, the name was changed to Krasnoperekopsk, and in 1966, it received the status of a city. On 12 May 2016, Ukrainian authorities renamed the city Yany Kapu as part of its decommunization efforts. The renaming was originally intended to come into effect in the event that Ukraine regains Crimea, but the law was edited on 23 August 2023 to come into effect the next day. Crimean Soda Plant [uk], a major manufacturer of sodium carbonate Brom Joint Stock Company [ru], manufactures bromine and bromine-based non-organic and organic compounds Krasnoperekopsk's climate is mostly dry and hot in the summer, and mild in the winter. The average temperature ranges from −2.4 °C (27.7 °F) in January, to 23.3 °C (73.9 °F) in July. The average precipitation is 336 mm (13.2 in) per year.[citation needed] Krasnoperekopsk is twinned with: Dzerzhinsky, Russia Serhiy Ferenchak (1984-2021), Ukrainian football player Since the 2014 Crimean crisis, the status of the Crimea and of the city of Sevastopol is under dispute between Russia and Ukraine; Ukraine and the majority of the international community considers the Crimea and Sevastopol an integral part of Ukraine, while Russia, on the other hand, considers the Crimea and Sevastopol an integral part of Russia, with Sevastopol functioning as a federal city within the Crimean Federal District. This place is located on the Crimean peninsula, which is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine, but since 2014 under Russian occupation. According to the administrative-territorial division of Ukraine, there are the Ukrainian divisions (the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city with special status of Sevastopol) located on the peninsula. Russia claims these as federal subjects of the Russian Federation (the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol). Patselia, Anastasiia; Hlianko, Kateryna (2023-09-12).
