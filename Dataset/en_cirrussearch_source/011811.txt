The Support Force Glacier was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photographs in 1956–66. It was named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for the United States Naval Support Force Antarctica, which provided logistical support for the United States Antarctic Program during this period.
