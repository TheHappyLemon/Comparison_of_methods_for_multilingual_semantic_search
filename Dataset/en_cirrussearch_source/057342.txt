Pepperstone is an Australian online broker that provides CFD trading. The company has offices in Melbourne, London, Düsseldorf, Dubai, Limassol, Nassau and Nairobi. Pepperstone was founded in 2010 by Owen Kerr and Joe Davenport. Davenport and Kerr both received the Australian EY Entrepreneurs Of The Year award in 2014. In 2013, Pepperstone helped the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Australian Federal Police uncover Australia's largest insider trading case in history. Another media report claimed that a senior employee was sacked after tipping off the regulator. In 2014, the firm was ranked #1 on BRW Fast Starters, with reported revenues of $60m and 66% growth. In October 2014, Pepperstone ceased accepting Japanese clients after an inquiry by ASIC regarding the lack of a license from the Japanese Financial Services Agency. In March 2016 Pepperstone announced it had finalized the sale of most of its business to Champ Private Equity. In February 2017, to comply with its FCA obligations, the firm temporarily closed down their UK operations. CHAMP Private Equity sold its stake in Pepperstone 2.5 years after investing in the online investment platform. The business was bought by its senior management team led by chief executive Tamas Szabo and CHAMP managing director Fiona Lock. In 2021 Pepperstone won the Best Forex Broker award at the DayTrading.com Broker Awards. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) agreed a global sponsership with Pepperstone in May 2022, a deal that included the naming rights to the official ATP rankings. This deal would last until February 2024, when Pepperstone's naming rights to the rankings was replaced by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. In 2023 Pepperstone won the "Best MT4 Broker" at The Good Money Guide Awards. Pepperstone offers Contract for difference (CFDs) and Financial spread betting on various third-party trading tools platforms, including Ctrader, MetaTrader 4 and 5, TradingView and Capitalise.ai. Pepperstone also offers a professional trader account called "Razor Account," for active and professional traders. The company is authorized and regulated by financial authorities, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the FCA in the United Kingdom, CySEC Cyprus, DFSA Dubai, CMA Kenya, SCB Bahamas and BaFin Germany.
