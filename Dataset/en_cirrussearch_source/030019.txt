Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc (CCEP), formerly Coca-Cola European Partners (2016–2021) is a British-American company formed as a result of the combination of the three main bottling companies for The Coca-Cola Company in Western Europe: Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola Iberian Partners, S.A. and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetränke AG, and one bottling company in Asia-Pacific: Coca-Cola Amatil. The multinational bottling company involved in the marketing, production, and distribution of Coca-Cola products and other drinks such as Capri-Sun, Monster and Relentless. Coca-Cola Europacific Partners was formed on 10 May 2021 by Coca-Cola European Partners' acquisition of Australian bottling company Coca-Cola Amatil. The new company maintained the CCEP stock tickers that its predecessor had used. Coca-Cola European Partners was formed on 28 May 2016 as a result of the combination of the three main bottling companies for The Coca-Cola Company in Western Europe: Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola Iberian Partners, S.A. and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetränke AG. The combination created the world's largest independent Coca-Cola bottler based on net revenues and was estimated to result in a savings of between $350 million and $375 million within three years of closing. The merger was similar to that of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which consolidated Coca-Cola bottling operations in East and Southern Africa. The company, with shares being traded in euros, has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since March 2019. In December 2022, the company bought the naming rights to Erebus Motorsport in the Supercars Championship. The team will compete under the name Coca-Cola Racing by Erebus for the 2023 and 2024 seasons. On February 23, 2024, Philippine-based Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. (AEV) announced that it has jointly acquired Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines Inc. together with Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) for $1.8 billion on a debt-free, cash-free basis. CCEP will hold a 60% stake, while Aboitiz Equity Ventures will take up the remaining 40% stake. Anchor bottler Coca-Cola Beverages Africa "About us". "Key facts". Coca-Cola Europacific Partners.
