Louise Elisabeth of Courland (12 August 1646 in Jelgava – 16 December 1690 in Weferlingen) was Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg by marriage to Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg. Louise Elisabeth was a daughter of Duke Jacob of Courland (1610-1662) from his marriage to Charlotte Louise (1617-1676), eldest daughter of Elector George William of Brandenburg. On 23 October 1670 in Cölln, she married the later Landgrave Frederick II of Hesse-Homburg, the famous Prince of Homburg. Frederick had converted to the Calvinist faith for the sake of their marriage. This conversion brought him into closer relations with the princely houses in Brandenburg and Hesse-Kassel, who were also Calvinist. Louise Elisabeth's sister Maria Amalia married Landgrave Charles of Hesse-Kassel in 1673. Louise Elizabeth was a niece of Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg. This relationship allowed Frederick to join the Prussian army and become commander of all the troops of the Electorate only two years later, in 1672. The Calvinist Louise Elisabeth played a significant role in the settlement of displaced Huguenots and Waldenses in Friedrichsdorf and Dornholzhausen in as well as in the formation of Calvinist congregations in Weferlingen and Bad Homburg.
