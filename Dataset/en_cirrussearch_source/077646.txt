Austrumi (Austrum Latvijas Linukss) is a bootable live CD Linux distribution based on Slackware. It was created and is actively maintained by a group from the Latgale region of Latvia. The entire operating system and all the applications run from RAM, making Austrumi faster than larger distributions that must read from a disk, and allowing the boot medium to be removed after the operating system has booted.
