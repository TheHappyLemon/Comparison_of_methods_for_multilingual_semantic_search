(See 1729 for more details). This implies that 91 is the second cabtaxi number. the smallest positive integer expressible as a sum of six distinct squares: 91 = 12 + 22 + 32 + 42 + 52 + 62. The only other ways to write 91 as a sum of distinct squares are: 91 = 12 + 42 + 52 + 72 and 91 = 12 + 32 + 92. the smallest pseudoprime satisfying the congruence 3n ≡ 3 mod n. a repdigit in base 9 (1119). palindromic in bases 3 (101013), 9 (1119), and 12 (7712). a Riordan number.
