Micheal Ray Stevenson (born November 19, 1989), known professionally as Tyga (/ˈtaɪɡə/; a backronym for Thank You God Always), is an American rapper from Gardena, California. After a number of independent releases, he signed a recording contract with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment, an imprint of Cash Money Records and Republic Records in 2008. His major label debut, Careless World: Rise of the Last King (2012) peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and saw generally positive critical reception. It spawned the Billboard Hot 100-top 40 singles "Rack City" and "Faded" (featuring Lil Wayne). His third album, Hotel California (2013) was met with trailing critical and commercial response, along with his collaborative album, Fan of a Fan: The Album (2015) with singer Chris Brown. Due to disagreements with Young Money, Tyga's fourth album, The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty was released independently in June 2015. Executive-produced by Kanye West, it became his lowest-selling album to that point with estimated sales of 5,000 album equivalent units in its first week. His fifth and sixth albums, BitchImTheShit2 (2017) and Kyoto (2018) were met with continued stagnation. Following this, his May 2018 single, "Taste" (featuring Offset) marked a brief period of commercial resurgence, peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming his first top 40 single since "Ayo" (with Chris Brown) in 2015. It served as lead single and preceded the release of his seventh album, Legendary (2019). Micheal Ray Stevenson was born on November 19, 1989, in Compton, California, and raised there until he "was about 11, 12", before moving to adjacent Gardena. He was born to Jamaican and Vietnamese parents. His mother was born in Vietnam and has the maiden name Nguyen. He grew up listening to Fabolous, Lil Wayne, Cam'ron and Eminem, among others. On December 3, 2012, debate arose concerning Tyga's upbringing. Tyga claimed to have been brought up in the low socioeconomic area of Compton, but in leaked footage from the unaired television show Bustas, he claimed he grew up in a "well-to-do" home in the Valley, where his parents drove a Range Rover. He also claimed that he attained his nickname from his mother calling him Tiger Woods. There has been speculation that his claims on the show were satirical and not to be taken seriously. Tyga responded to the video's leak on Twitter: "When u 14 an ambitious u don't give a fuk about anything. Scripted tv isn't that what we all live for. Hahahaha." Tyga's career began with him releasing a multitude of demo tapes and mixtapes. His 2007 debut mixtape, Young On Probation, garnered the attention of fellow California rapper and Gym Class Heroes lead vocalist, Travie McCoy. I met Tyga, he handed me a mixtape on Melrose. I was out in L.A. shopping. (...) You know, being on the road, I get demos and mixtapes all the time. Me and Matt, the drummer of Gym Class, we had this running joke like, “Let's start the record label called Roadside Records”. The joke was, “Yeah give us your demo and we’ll sign you to Roadside Records.” Our motto was “your demo hits the streets the same night” which means as soon as we get your demo, we throwing them bitches out the bus window. (laughs) For some reason, I didn’t throw Tyga’s out. I kept it and listened to it like, homie got potential and he had a lot of energy. So I took him under my wing. —Travie McCoy discussing his first time meeting of Tyga in a 2021 interview with HotNewHipHop. Seeing talent in the artist, McCoy led him to sign a recording contract with the independent label DCD2 Records (known then as Decaydence Records). McCoy further stated that he "had [Tyga] sending me verses every other day. We started doing interviews, and he was like, 'This my big cousin Trav.' So a lot of people had the misunderstanding we were blood-related". Tyga also formed the record label G.E.D. Inc. (Grinding every day, Getting every dollar, or Getting educated daily) around the time, the same imprint that helped launch the career of fellow West Coast rapper Schoolboy Q, with whom he has worked with early in his career. Tyga also has a G.E.D. Inc tattoo above his right eyebrow. On June 10, 2008, Tyga released his debut studio album, No Introduction through Decaydance Records and McCoy's label, BatSquad Records. It was preceded by the single "Coconut Juice," featuring McCoy, which became his first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album peaked at number 112 on the Billboard 200 and received mixed reviews. A song from the album, "Diamond Life" was used in the video games Need for Speed: Undercover and Madden NFL 2009, as well as in the 2009 film Fighting. In late 2008, Tyga signed a new record deal with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment, which was a subsidiary of Cash Money Records at the time. Tyga met Wayne at the 2008 VMA's, performing the remix of Fall Out Boy's "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race". He appeared on the label's posse cut hit single "Bedrock" shortly after his signing. He later released the mixtape Fan of a Fan with singer Chris Brown and producers DJ Ill Will and DJ Rockstar. It featured other artists such as Bow Wow, Lil Wayne, and Kevin McCall featured in several tracks. Four tracks — "Holla at Me", "G Shit", "No Bullshit" and "Deuces" — were accompanied with music videos. The track "Deuces" was released as the lead single for the mixtape and reached number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs; it was also nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 53rd Grammy Awards. Tyga told MTV in an interview that the mixtape's production took just short of a week. "Deuces" was eventually included on Brown's fourth studio album, F.A.M.E. (2011). Careless World: Rise of the Last King was his second studio album. The album was released on February 21, 2012, on Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records, and Universal Republic Records. Careless World: Rise of the Last King is a move to the rapping style he featured in the collaboration album We Are Young Money rather than the poppy dance element exemplified on his previous effort, No Introduction. Tyga stated that the album shows he has grown up but still relates to the kids. In preparation for the album, Tyga released the mixtape #BitchImTheShit in December 2011. The first official single, "Far Away", was released on May 17, 2011, and peaked at 86 on the Billboard Hot 100. The second official single, "Still Got It", was released on October 4, 2011, and peaked at 89 on the Billboard Hot 100. The third official single, "Rack City", was released on December 6, 2011.

It debuted at number 94 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has peaked at number 8 since then. The fourth official single, "Faded", was released on January 13, 2012. It peaked on the Hot 100 at No. 33. Tyga's sixth single, "Do My Dance" which features 2 Chainz was released on October 2, 2012, and peaked at No. 79 on the Billboard Hot 100. He has released various mixtapes such as well-acclaimed #BitchImTheShit and Well Done 3. That year Tyga also produced and co-directed (with Justice Young) a multi-AVN Award-nominated crossover adult film, Rack City: The XXX Movie, which starred Skin Diamond, Jada Fire, Ice La Fox, Sophie Dee, Lexington Steele, Kristina Rose, London Keyes and Daisy Marie. He also signed the soundtrack, which includes the hits "Rack City" and "Faded" together with several original songs, and he appeared in the film in a non-sex role. Tyga's third studio album, Hotel California, was released on April 9, 2013. The first single, "Dope", was released on December 25. The sported a feature from rapper Rick Ross. Before the single dropped Tyga released a nine-track mixtape under the name 187. 187 the mixtape was released on November 30, 2012. It features remixes to songs such as 2 Chainz's "I'm Different", Meek Mill's "Young & Gettin' It" and GOOD Music's "Clique", among others and new material. On episode three of Tyga's tour vlog Tyga confirmed four features on the upcoming album, including Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, Chris Brown, and Wiz Khalifa. Tyga performed at Harvard University's Yardfest in the Spring of 2013, despite opposition from critics who've signed a petition seeking to keep him away over what they call his "violently misogynistic lyrics". At this time, Tyga collaborated with singer Sabi on her song "Cali Love". Hotel California was released on April 9, 2013. The album featured guest appearances from Lil Wayne, Chris Brown, Rick Ross, 2 Chainz, Game, Wiz Khalifa, Future and Jadakiss. Along with production by Cool & Dre, D. A.

The album was met with generally mixed reviews from music critics. It also was less successful than his debut album commercially, debuting at number seven on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 54,000 copies in the United States.

He also explained that the album would, be more "way less commercial". He also said "I felt like Hotel California was more commercial and I made more radio-type records. This album is straight rap." Then on April 9, 2014, Tyga released a song called "Hookah" which features the rapper Young Thug. On May 1, 2014, Tyga made a tweet referring to Kanye West, Mike Dean, and his own producer Jess Jackson with a hash-tag The Gold Album.

Tyga criticized Drake in an October 2014 interview, calling Drake "fake" and said that he did not like Nicki Minaj. On October 21, 2014, Tyga lashed out on his record label Young Money Entertainment, reporting that his album was completed, but that his music was being "held hostage" by the label, who would not allow him to release it, and stated that he was considering leaking the album. On December 4, 2014, Tyga made a tweet declaring his project, The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty would be released independently due to not being on good terms with label Cash Money Records. In February 2015, Tyga released a collaborative album with Chris Brown, titled Fan of a Fan: The Album.

On June 23, 2015, Tyga released The Gold Album for streaming exclusively on Spotify then later on Apple Music. The album became his worst selling album to date, selling roughly 2,000 units on its opening week. His reality show Kingin' with Tyga premiered on July 24, 2015, on MTV2. On September 7, 2016, Kanye West, who, like Tyga, was in a relationship to a Kardashian at the time, announced that he had signed Tyga to his GOOD Music imprint, under the aegis of Def Jam Recordings. On July 17, 2017, it was announced that Tyga will join as a series regular in the third season of the VH1 slasher television series Scream. He starred in the role of Jamal Elliot.

On February 16, 2018, Tyga released his sixth studio album, Kyoto. The album was panned by critics and sold poorly, becoming his first album to fail to chart anywhere. On May 16, 2018, Tyga released the single "Taste" featuring Offset of Migos. The song was a hit, becoming one of the biggest songs of summer 2018 and peaking at number 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It marked Tyga's first entry on the Hot 100 in three years, since 2015's Ride Out, and is certified 9× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song is considered the catalyst for Tyga's return to the mainstream music spotlight after almost 5 years of poor sales and negative reviews, being considered his "comeback" record. Following the success of "Taste", Tyga released a number of other singles throughout the latter of 2018, beginning with "Swish", which was certified gold, and later released "Dip" featuring Nicki Minaj, which was certified platinum. He was also featured on Iggy Azalea's platinum single, "Kream". Tyga's seventh album Legendary was released in June 2019. In 2019, YG released the single "Go Loko", which featured Tyga. He stated, "We wanted to do something different to kinda try to bring all Latins together" and "Even YG could tell you, he grew up around all Mexicans, so we really wanted to do something to give back to the culture." In July 2020, Tyga partnered with businessman Robert Earl to launch a virtual kitchen brand called Tyga Bites, which uses existing restaurants' kitchens to produce branded menu items such as boneless chicken wings for delivery service only. In 2021, Tyga competed on the sixth season of The Masked Singer as "Dalmatian". He was the first of Group B to be eliminated. On September 6, 2010, Tyga married Jordan Craig. He filed for divorce one month later, and it was finalized in 2011. Tyga met model Blac Chyna on October 5, 2011, at The F.A.M.E Tour After Party with Chris Brown at King of Diamonds in Miami. Blac Chyna was cast as Tyga's leading lady in his "Rack City" music video. They became engaged on November 9, 2011, and posed for the cover of Urban Ink magazine in March 2012. On October 16, 2012, their son, named King Cario, was born, and Tyga purchased a $6.5 million mansion in Calabasas, California that same month. Both parents have tattoos of their son's name. The couple split in 2014. After months of speculation, Tyga confirmed his relationship with reality star Kylie Jenner in August 2015. However, this relationship sparked controversy due to the age disparity, and the fact that they were reportedly dating since Jenner was 16. The legal age of consent in the state of California is 18. Photos of him and Jenner first seen holding hands in Mexico went viral a few days after her 18th birthday. The couple split in April 2017. Tyga dated British social model Demi Rose for a short time in 2016. In 2021, he was in a relationship with Camaryn Swanson. In June 2008, Tyga was robbed of his jewelry by unknown assailants. A pair of diamond chains would end up in the hands of local rapper 40 Glocc, who showed them off in an online video. Tyga would eventually admit to the robbery, but said 40 Glocc wasn't behind it. "Some niggas seen me and ran up on me with a little burner... I guess 40 Glocc's peoples robbed the peoples that got me, and then hopped on YouTube, talking about they robbed me." In late 2012, Tyga was sued by two women who appeared in the "Make It Nasty" video for $10 million each; they claimed he had shown their nipples without their consent. They were assured that this would be edited out and the unedited version would not be released, but Tyga proceeded to release a fully unedited version. On September 21, 2013, another woman from the video sued Tyga for sexual battery, fraud, invasion of privacy, and infliction of emotional distress. She claims, like the two other women who have filed suit against him, that she was convinced to dance topless and assured her breasts would be edited out. On September 4, 2013, it was reported Tyga had been sued by Beverly Hills-based jeweler Jason Arasheben for allegedly not paying for roughly $91,000 worth of jewelry. Arasheben claims that Tyga agreed to pay $28,275 for the jeweler's diamond pantheon watch in August 2012 and that he borrowed a $63,000 diamond Cuban link chain in December 2012 and never returned the item, so he sued Tyga for the cost of both pieces, plus late fees, which totaled up to $185,306.50 in damages, double the original total cost. Tyga fell ill before the interrogation of this debt and was considered not able to proceed. He also did not bring the documents he was supposed to, however, he paid $100,000 of the $200,000 owed to his client. In June 2015, a judge ordered Tyga to pay an $80,000 settlement to a former landlord, who rented a home to the rapper in the city of Calabasas, California. It was the second ruling in the case, following a judgement in May 2015, in which he was ordered to pay $90,000, though the debt was never paid. In September 2015, the state of California placed a tax lien on Tyga for $19,000 in unpaid taxes. On his birthday, he was given a lawsuit in 2016. In October 2021, Tyga was arrested by police over domestic abuse charges.
