The European Olympic Committees (EOC; French: Comités olympiques européens, COE) is an organisation based in Rome, Italy, consisting of 50 National Olympic Committees from the continent of Europe. Among other duties, the EOC organizes three major multi-sport events. These are the European Youth Olympic Festival, the Games of the Small States of Europe and the European Games. The EOC has no connection with another multi-sport event called the European Championships, which are organised by various European discipline-specific sports associations. In the following table, the year in which the NOC was recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is also given if it is different from the year in which the NOC was created. European Games European Youth Olympic Festival (EYOF) Games of the Small States of Europe European Paralympic Committee EOC members include transcontinental countries Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia and the Russian Federation, as well as Israel, Cyprus and Armenia which are geographically in Asia but due to political-cultural reasons are often assigned to Europe. Between 1954 and 1974, Israel took part in the Asian Games, but political pressure exerted by Arab countries due to the Arab–Israeli conflict led to Israel's exclusion from the re-organized Olympic Council of Asia in 1981 (See Israelis Facing Asian Ban). It then became a member of the European Olympic Committees in 1994.
