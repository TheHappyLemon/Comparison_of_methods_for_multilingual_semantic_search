Calbayog, officially the City of Calbayog (Waray: Siyudad san Calbayog; Filipino: Lungsod ng Calbayog), is a 1st class component city in the province of Samar, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 186,960 people. It lies along the coastal region of the province stretching about 60 miles (97 km) from the northern tip of the island and 180 miles (290 km) from southern boundaries. It is the sixth largest city in terms of land and water areas in the Philippines. It is the nineteenth city of the Philippines. In 2020, Calbayog has 37,807 households with a population of 186,960 people, making up 24.7% of the total population of the province of Samar. Calbayog is one of the commercial trade centers in Eastern Visayas. Calbayog is subdivided into three major districts: Calbayog, Tinambacan and Oquendo. After the exile of Rizal in Dapitan, the Katipunan was born in Binondo, Manila. Andres Bonifacio and his men moved heaven and earth to fight against the Spanish government then led by Gob. Heneral Polavieja. The katipunan expanded its membership from Luzon down to the Visayas Region, thereby increasing the number of Katipuneros in a span of one year. Sensing the secret plan of the Katipunan to overthrow the government, the Spanish authorities raided a Binondo printing press where subversive documents were found and confiscated. One of the documents seized was the list of members of the Katipunan. The name Benedicto Nijaga was one in the list, being the collector of revolutionary funds in the area. Upon learning of the arrests, Governor Polavieja ordered the arrest of all suspected members of the Katipunan. Nijaga was arrested together with twelve other katipuneros while campaigning for revolutionary funds. Shortly after they were jailed and reportedly tortured, a trial ensued, reminiscent of that of Rizal and other Filipino nationalists. The 13 men were convicted and sentenced to death. On January 11, 1897, the thirteen were taken to Bagumbayan field under heavy guard. Just before sunrise, the men were executed. Colegio-Seminario de San Vicente de Paul (now Christ the King College and St. Vincent de Paul Seminary) were established in 1905 and La Milagrosa Academy was established in 1910. On April 10, 1910, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Calbayog was created by virtue of the Papal Bull of Pope Pius X, comprising the islands of Samar and Leyte. Calbayog became the episcopal see of the diocese. In 1942, the Japanese Army occupied Calbayog city. In 1945 the city was finally liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth troops and the guerrillas who had continued the fight against the Japanese throughout World War II. It was only much later that other dioceses in the region were created. Republic Act No. 328, otherwise known as the City Charter of Calbayog was signed into law on July 15, 1948, by then President Elpidio Quirino. The first set of city officials, incumbent municipal officials of the place, were sworn in on October 16, 1948. The city comprises the territorial jurisdiction of the former Municipalities of Calbayog, Oquendo and Tinambacan. In January 2008 Roberto Navidad, a Regional Trial Court (RTC) judge was shot dead in Calbayog City outside a drug store at the corner of Gomez Street and Nijaga Boulevard. As of 2008, the crime was still unsolved. He was the 15th judge to be ambushed in the Philippines since July 20, 1999 (the 14th under the Arroyo government). On May 1, 2011, Calbayog's Mayor Reynaldo Uy was murdered by unknown gunmen. After his death, Vice-Mayor Ronaldo P. Aquino was sworn in as city mayor. On March 8, 2021, approximately 10 years after the death of Mayor Uy, Mayor Ronaldo P. Aquino was ambushed and killed by members of the Samar Provincial Police while on his way to his son's birthday party. The van he was riding was pelted with multiple bullets from high-powered arms. Two of his personnel were also among the casualties of the ambush. Vice Mayor Diego P. Rivera has been appointed as successor and is currently the Mayor of Calbayog City. On June 9, 2021, a senate investigation led by Senator Ronald "Bato" de la Rosa was conducted where the PNP, NBI and members of the Aquino family presented their testimonies and findings. Charges have been filed on the policemen. As of the 2022 election, Raymund "monmon" Uy is now the city's mayor. In the last quarter of 2021, Samar 1st district congressman Edgar Mary Sarmiento proposed to convert the city of Calbayog from being a component city into an independent component city through the virtue of House Bill No. 10483. The city has a total land area of 88,074 hectares (217,640 acres) as of 2007 which is 0.29% of the Philippines total land area, 3.79% of the regional land area, 6.12% of the island of Samar and 14.56% of the Samar province area. Forty percent of the city's land area are plain and hilly terrains with elevation ranging from 5 to 20 metres (16 to 66 ft) above sea level. The rest are rugged mountain ranges with elevations from 300 to 700 metres (980 to 2,300 ft) above sea level. Flooding is minimized because of many rivers, brooks, streams and natural water conveyors that flow towards the sea. Calbayog experiences a variety of wind types: Amihan (northeastwind), Timog (southwind), Habagat (southwestwind), Canaway (northwest wind), Cabunghan (east wind), Dumagsa (southeast wind) and Salatan (west wind). Calbayog has well distributed rainfall throughout the year, except during the summer months of February through May, when most parts of the city are dry. The highest rainfall intensity recorded is 267 millimetres (10.5 in) per hour. Heavy downpour is seldom experienced in the locality, therefore making Calbayog potentially appropriate for protective agricultural investment. Calbayog is politically subdivided into 157 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios. These barangays are grouped in three districts. The district is located in the southern and eastern boundaries of the city and is the main political and commercial District the city. The district is bounded to the north by the Oquendo and Tinambacan districts, to the south by the municipality of Santa Margarita and to the east by Matuguinao.

Water and Sanitation Calbayog Water (now owned by Manila Water) is in charge of the water utility in Calbayog City. As of 2017, it was using the Himonini River and Pasungon Falls as water sources. The Dawu interior of Danaw, water reservoir, a dam was built for the Calbayog City Water District near Malajog. The dam was built for irrigation to nearby villages of Pilar and Dawu. The old dam or reservoir that was built near Oquendo is somewhat hefty and expensive since it uses river water and its expensive to purify the river water. The new reservoir was connected to the old pipelines of Calbayog City Water District. Some Fire truck Hydrants were located inside the City. Energy and Power Samar I Electric Cooperative, Inc. (SAMELCO I) is located in Carayman, Calbayog.
