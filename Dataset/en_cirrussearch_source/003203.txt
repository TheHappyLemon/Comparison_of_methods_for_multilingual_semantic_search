Princess Christina, Mrs. Magnuson, LoK av KMO (Christina Louise Helena, born 3 August 1943) is a member of the Swedish royal family. She is the fourth child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and the youngest of the four older sisters of King Carl XVI Gustaf. She generally uses the name Christina Magnuson. Christina was born at Haga Palace outside Stockholm as the fourth child and youngest daughter of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. She is the granddaughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden. She met her future husband, Tord Magnuson, at a lunch in Stockholm in 1961. Her engagement to Magnuson was announced on 1 February 1974. The couple married on 15 June 1974 in the Palace Church of the Royal Palace of Stockholm. The couple have three sons: Carl Gustaf Victor (b. 1975), Tord Oscar Frederik (born 1977) and Victor Edmund Lennart (born 1980). Christina Magnuson chaired the Swedish Red Cross for nine years, and through her friendship with Kjerstin Dellert for many years has been chairman of the Ulriksdal Palace theatre's friendship society. In January 2023, the princess was seen and heard commenting extensively throughout a two-part documentary broadcast by Sweden's national public service Sveriges Television about the last three kings of Sweden: her brother, grandfather and great-grandfather. The princess has publicly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine calling it unacceptable and accusing Russia of committing war crimes. In October 2016, it was announced that Magnuson has been diagnosed with chronic leukemia. It was later made known that she had been cured following stem cell treatment. 3 August 1943 – 1 February 1974: Her Royal Highness Princess Christina of Sweden 1 February 1974 – present: Princess Christina, Mrs. Magnuson  Sweden: Member Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (LoK av KMO)  Sweden: Member of the Royal Family Decoration of King Gustaf VI Adolf, 1st Class  Sweden: Member of the Royal Family Decoration of King Carl XVI Gustaf, 2nd Class  Sweden: Recipient of the Kings Medal, Special Class  Sweden: Recipient of the Prince Carl Medal  Sweden: Recipient of the 90th Birthday Medal of King Gustav V  Sweden: Recipient of the Commemorative Medal of King Gustav V  Sweden: Recipient of the 85th Birthday Medal of King Gustaf VI Adolf  Sweden: Recipient of the 50th Birthday Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf  Sweden: Recipient of the Wedding Medal of Crown Princess Victoria to Daniel Westling  Sweden: Recipient of the Ruby Jubilee Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf  Sweden: Recipient of the 70th Birthday Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf  Sweden: Recipient of the Golden Jubilee Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf  Argentina: Grand Cross of the Order of the Liberator General San Martín  Denmark: Knight of the Order of the Elephant  France: Commander of the Order of the Legion of Honour  Germany: Grand Cross 1st Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany  Iceland: Grand Cross of the Order of the Falcon  Italy: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic  Japan: Grand Cordon (Paulownia) of the Order of the Precious Crown  Netherlands: Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown (11 October 2022)  Norway: Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Olav  Portugal: Grand Cross of the Order of Christ  Yugoslavia: Star and Sash of the Order of the Yugoslav Great Star  Sweden: Member Grand Cross of the Social Grand Order of the Amaranth  Sweden: Member Grand Cross of the Social Order of Innocence International Red Cross and Red Crescent: Recipient of the Henry Dunant Medal Codrington, Andrea (29 April 1999).
