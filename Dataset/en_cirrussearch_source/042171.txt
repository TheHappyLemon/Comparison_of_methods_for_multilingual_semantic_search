He first came to prominence after winning season six of X-Factor Ukraine.

Bocharov was born in Odesa to parents Mykola Bocharov and Valentyna Bocharova. He became interested in music at a young age, and as a child would put on and perform in concerts at his school. He later began attending a music school, but left before graduating. He subsequently enrolled in a theatre school, which he graduated from. Bocharov had auditioned for X-Factor Ukraine three times, but never got onto the televised show. Eventually, he passed his audition for the show's sixth season in 2015. He advanced through the competition and was eventually declared the winner. Following the show's completion, he went on a tour of Ukraine along with the show's other finalists. In 2016, he released his debut single "Ne odinokaya". On 17 January 2017, Bocharov was announced as one of the 23 competitors in Vidbir 2017, the Ukrainian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2017, with the song "Wonder". Bocharov competed in the third semi-final on 18 February 2017, where he placed second and qualified to the final as one of the top two finishers. In the semi-final, he received the highest number of televotes from the Ukrainian public but only placed fourth with the jury consisting of Konstantin Meladze, Jamala, and Andriy Danylko. The final was held on 25 February 2017. Bocharov placed third, after receiving the highest number of televotes from the Ukrainian public again, but placing second-to-last with the jury. The following year, Bocharov confirmed his return to Vidbir on 16 January 2018 after being confirmed as one of the 18 competing acts in Vidbir 2018 with the song "Under the Ladder". He competed in the second semi-final on 17 February 2018, where he qualified to the final as one of the top three finishers, placing first with the highest number of televotes from the Ukrainian public and second-highest number of jury votes from the jury consisting of Jamala, Danylko, and Eugene Filatov. He won the final on 24 February and thus represented Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal. He placed 17th in the voting in Eurovision Song Contest 2018 final, gaining only eleven points from juries of 43 countries and 119 points from televiewers all around the world. After Eurovision 2018, he went on to release his new single "That's Your Role". Bocharov won the second season of The Masked Singer Ukraine in December 2021.
