The name of Sokolsky is known now mostly for his opening research and development of the chess opening 1.b4 which became known as the Sokolsky Opening. It is also known as the Polish Opening or the Orangutan. Sokolsky Memorial master-norm tournaments have been held regularly in Minsk since 1970. Sokolsky wrote over a dozen books. The most famous of these are The Modern Openings in Theory and Practice (1962) and Debyut 1.b2-b4 (1963), a book about his eponymous opening. Nathan Divinsky (1990). The Batsford Chess Encyclopedia.
