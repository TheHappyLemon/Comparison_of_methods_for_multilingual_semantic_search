Skanste is a neighbourhood located in the center of Riga, the capital of Latvia. Geographically, the neighborhood is situated in the northern part of the railway ring on the right bank of the Daugava, bordering the Sarkandaugava, Brasa, Centrs, and Pētersala-Andrejsala neighborhoods. Skanste is considered part of the compact center of Riga. The neighborhood's central traffic artery is Skanstes Street, but the area is delineated by Pulkveža Brieža, Hanzas, Vesetas, and Duntes streets, as well as Ganību dambis, and the railroad. The area that for decades was allotted for kitchen garden plots, has now been developed to include office towers, sports infrastructure complexes and residential buildings. Next to the historical heart of Riga and its so-called "quiet center", Skanste is developing as a contemporary neighborhood, attractive both to city residents and entrepreneurs and fosters Riga's competitiveness regionally and in the European context. Skanste continues to grow and there are several plans that will be implemented in the coming years. The Skanste neighborhood takes up 215 hectares (530 acres) measuring by perimeter, and its border is more than six kilometers (4 miles) long. Currently, more than 12,000 people live or work in Skanste, and if large-scale plans for the neighborhood are carried out, these numbers could exceed 42 thousand. On average, the Elektrum Olympic Center and Arena Riga receive 1.9 million visitors a year. When the Metta Youth Football Education Center, a multifunctional private clinic, the Riga Conference, the Concert Center and other projects come to fruition, the annual number of Skanste visitors will grow to 3 million people. In the Riga city development strategy for up to 2030, Skanste has been defined as a priority territory for development with the creation of a central business district, a congress center and a new tram line. The vision for the Skanste neighborhood is an active development of the center of Riga, its residential and cultural space developed in synergy with its business functions. The neighborhood has been designated as a priority area for development. Currently, Skanste is the only and largest partially developed territory in the center of the city. The Riga City Council received a letter from the Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry with a permission to begin implementing the local planning of the territory. The Skanste Development Agency document, as well as those for city development, provide for Skanste to fit in well with the compact center of Riga as its most modern part. If, in the historical and "quiet" parts of the center all buildings and infrastructure are historical and all efforts are expent to maintain or renovate the buildings, then Skanste is a free territory in the center of the city where a functioning modern district can be developed. The Skanste development territory has been included in the spatial nucleus of Riga with a compact type of occupancy. Since most jobs are located in the city center, the development plans include constructing residential buildings as close as possible to this part of the capital. The other direction of development regards office space. Skanste is a location for international business service centers, representing international enterprises or branches set up for particular functions with competitive salary schemes. 10,000 jobs are scheduled to be created in this sector in the next four years. Members of the Skanste Development Agency have already made substantial investments and in the future the amount of investment will continue to grow. The local government plans to develop this neighborhood in synergy with entrepreneurs. Infrastructure will be built by attracting EU money, and entrepreneurs will develop their projects. By 2018, investments in Skanste amounted to €300 million. By 2024, this amount is projected to increase to about €800 million, including building a conference and concert center (with planned annual attendance of ~ 600,000), a multifunctional private clinic (with planned annual attendance of ~ 250,000), developing an internationally oriented innovation and gastronomy quarter 'Sporta 2' and the FS METTA Youth Football Education Center (with planned annual attendance of ~ 150,000), as well as office and residential buildings. The Riga City Council is planning to attract European funding to build the infrastructure, including the much discussed new tram line, which will connect the Skanste neighborhood to the city center: it is expected that the cost for building the tram line will be €100 million, and €7 million for streets and parks. Altogether, it is planned to invest €900 million in the development of the Skanste neighborhood: one of the largest real estate investment objects. Next to the historical and "quiet" centers, Skanste is developing as the modern part of the capital. The neighborhood that covers over 200 ha (490 acres) already houses the central offices of several banks, and new apartment and office buildings.
