Valdo Cândido Filho (born 12 January 1964), simply known as Valdo, is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a central midfielder, and a current manager of Congo national football team. In a senior career which spanned more than two decades, he played professionally – other than in his own country – in Portugal, France and Japan. Having appeared more than 40 times for Brazil, Valdo represented the nation in two World Cups and as many Copa América tournaments. Born in Siderópolis, Santa Catarina, Valdo began playing football with Figueirense Futebol Clube, making his professional debuts with Grêmio Football Porto-Alegrense, with which he won four consecutive Rio Grande do Sul Leagues. In the summer of 1988 he signed with S.L. Benfica of Portugal alongside compatriot Ricardo Gomes, a central defender. Both were important elements in their debut season as the team won the Primeira Liga championship, a feat which was again accomplished in 1991, with the midfielder netting five goals in 26 matches. Both Valdo and Gomes left for Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in the 1991 summer, and both would return four years later to the Lisbon side, having won a total of four titles, including the 1993–94 edition of the Ligue 1. In his second Benfica spell, he played in 30 league matches in each of his two seasons, winning the Taça de Portugal in 1996. Aged 32, Valdo joined J1 League club Nagoya Grampus Eight, and returned to his country after two slow years. He would continue to play until the age of 40, representing six teams in quick succession (he ended his career after having helped Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas achieve its return to the Série A). Valdo began working as a manager in 2009, in Brazilian amateur football. Five years later, he rejoined his former Benfica boss Artur Jorge at MC Alger from Algeria. Valdo earned 45 caps for the Brazil national team, during six years. Before having made his first appearance he was called to the 1986 FIFA World Cup squad, but did not play one single second. In the 1990 edition in Italy, Valdo was already a starter, and took part in the country's four matches in the tournament, including the round-of-16 1–0 loss against Argentina. Upon retiring from football, Valdo settled in Portugal with his Portuguese wife. The couple had one daughter, Tatiele, who died in a car accident at only 13.
