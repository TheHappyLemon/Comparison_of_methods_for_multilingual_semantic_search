The province is considered part of Turkish Kurdistan and has a Kurdish majority with a significant Turkish minority. In 1927 the office of the Inspector General was created, which governed with martial law. The province was included in the first Inspectorate General (Umumi Müfettişlik, UM) over which the Inspector General ruled. The UM span over the provinces of Hakkâri, Siirt, Van, Mardin, Bitlis, Şanlıurfa, Elazığ and Diyarbakır. In December 1935, the Tunceli Law was passed, which demanded a more powerful Government in the region. In January 1936 the Elazığ Province was transferred under the authority of the newly established Fourth Inspectorate General, which span over the provinces of Elazığ, Erzincan, Bingöl and Tunceli and its seat was in the city of Elazığ. The fourth UM was governed by a Governor-Commander. Most of the employees in the municipalities had to be from the military and the Governor-Commander had the authority to evacuate whole villages and resettle them in another part of the province. In 1946 the Tunceli Law was abolished and the state of emergency removed but the authority of the fourth UM was transferred to the military. The Inspectorates General were dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party.
