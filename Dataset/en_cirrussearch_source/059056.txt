The 1980–81 European Cup was the 26th season of the European Cup football club tournament, and was won for a third time by Liverpool, who beat six-time champions Real Madrid in the final. In the 11 seasons up to and including this one, there were only four winners of the European Cup (Ajax, Bayern Munich, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool), but there were eleven different runners-up. This sequence was ended the following year, when Bayern Munich lost to first-time finalists Aston Villa. Nottingham Forest, the defending champions, were eliminated by CSKA Sofia in the first round. 16 August 1980 Népstadion, Budapest Attendance: 1,500 Referee: Ramiz Pregja (Albania) 3 September 1980 Empire Stadium, Gżira Attendance: 2,118 Referee: Peter Scherz (Switzerland) Budapest Honvéd won 11–0 on aggregate. 17 September 1980 Pittodrie Stadium, Aberdeen Attendance: 19,000 Referee: Rolf Nyhus (Norway) 17 September 1980 Raatin Stadion, Oulu Attendance: 13,000 Referee: Rolf Eriksson (Sweden) 17 September 1980 Vasil Levski National Stadium, Sofia Attendance: 60,000 Referee: Luigi Agnolin (Italy) 17 September 1980 Hüseyin Avni Stadyumu, Trabzon Attendance: 16,481 Referee: Ioan Igna (Romania) 17 September 1980 Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium, Athens Attendance: 34,800 Referee: Károly Palotai (Hungary) 17 September 1980 Stadiumi Kombëtar Qemal Stafa, Tirana Attendance: 31,000 Referee: Nikolaos Zlatanos (Greece) 17 September 1980 Kópavogsvöllur, Kópavogur Attendance: 928 Referee: Frederick McKnight (Northern Ireland) 17 September 1980 Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion, East Berlin Attendance: 15,100 Referee: Ib Nielsen (Denmark) 17 September 1980 Stade de la Frontière, Esch-sur-Alzette Attendance: 1,800 Referee: Rudolf Renggli (Switzerland) 17 September 1980 Örjans Vall, Halmstad Attendance: 2,581 Referee: Antonin Vencl (Czechoslovakia) 17 September 1980 Lansdowne Road, Dublin Attendance: 7,000 Referee: Ole Amundsen (Denmark) 17 September 1980 Estádio do Bonfim, Setúbal Attendance: 30,000 Referee: Alexis Ponnet (Belgium) 16 September 1980 Haarlem Stadion, Haarlem Attendance: 940 Referee: Henk van Ettekoven (Netherlands) 17 September 1980 San Siro, Milan Attendance: 63,800 Referee: Bernd Stumpf (East Germany) 17 September 1980 Olympiastadion, Bruges Attendance: 21,500 Referee: Adolf Mathias (Austria) 17 September 1980 Stavanger Stadion, Stavanger Attendance: 7,448 Referee: Arto Ravander (Finland) 1 October 1980 Praterstadion, Vienna Attendance: 35,000 Referee: Eldar Azimzade (Soviet Union) Aberdeen won 1–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 Anfield, Liverpool Attendance: 21,013 Referee: Magnús Pétursson (Iceland) Liverpool won 11–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 City Ground, Nottingham Attendance: 25,818 Referee: Walter Horstmann (West Germany) CSKA Sofia won 2–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 Stadion Szombierek, Szombierki Attendance: 9,000 Referee: Erik Fredriksson (Sweden) Szombierki Bytom won 4–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 Olympiastadion, Munich Attendance: 9,400 Referee: Bob Valentine (Scotland) Bayern Munich won 7–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 Olympisch Stadion, Amsterdam Attendance: 8,100 Referee: Eamonn Farrell (Ireland) Ajax won 3–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 Bazaly, Ostrava Attendance: 9,355 Referee: Edvard Sostarić (Yugoslavia) Baník Ostrava won 2–1 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 Makario Stadium, Nikosia Attendance: 4,000 Referee: Milorad Vlajić (Yugoslavia) BFC Dynamo won 4–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 Vladimir Lenin Central Stadium, Moscow Attendance: 8,000 Referee: Carol Jurja (Romania) Spartak Moscow won 9–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 Esbjerg Idrætspark, Esbjerg Attendance: 6,500 Referee: Marcel Van Langenhove (Belgium) Esbjerg won 3–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Madrid Attendance: 30,000 Referee: Augusto Marques Pires (Portugal) Real Madrid won 7–2 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 Népstadion, Budapest Attendance: 7,000 Referee: John Hunting (England) Budapest Honvéd won 3–0 on aggregate. 1 October 1980 Stade Marcel Saupin.
