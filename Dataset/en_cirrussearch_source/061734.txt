After recording 68 points in 24 games, Mercer chose to play prep hockey with the Bishop's College School under-18 varsity team at the age of 15. He chose to leave his home province in part to increase his playing ability and join his cousin. In his first season at Bishop, he finished third in scoring with 18 goals and 30 assists through 51 games to earn a high ranking by the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League's (QMJHL) Central Scouting.
