KLU - Kuehne Logistics University is a private business school based in Hamburg, Germany. It was founded by the Kuehne Foundation of German billionair Klaus-Michael Kühne, based in Schindellegi, Switzerland. The foundation supports education and research in logistics, supply chain, and operations management as well as keeping the assets of Kühne Family. KLU offers bachelor's degrees and three master's programs, a part-time MBA, and a structured PhD program. KLU is located at Hamburg's HafenCity area and its classes are taught in English. Steps leading to the creation of KLU KLU evolved in September 2010 from Kühne School of Logistics and Management, the graduate business school for logistics management at the Technical University of Hamburg (TUHH). The Kühne School was founded in 2003 as a public–private partnership by the Technical University of Hamburg and the Kühne Foundation as Hamburg School of Logistics, but was later renamed in honor of Klaus-Michael Kühne, a German entrepreneur who donated 3 million euro for the school's foundation, followed by an additional donation of 30 million euro in 2007. In conjunction with the opening ceremony of the new campus, Klaus-Michael Kühne donated an additional 40 million euro to the KLU. Kühne School offered a full-time and a part-time in-service M.B.A. program with a logistics management specialization, and two master's programs, one in Logistics, Infrastructure, and Mobility and the other in International Industrial Engineering. All programs are accredited by either ASIIN or FIBAA. As a private higher education institution, KLU has been accredited by the German Council of Science and Humanities (WR, Wissenschaftsrat) which regularly assesses the quality of private education undertakings in Germany. In its decision, the Wissenschaftsrat highlighted the international education at KLU and the quality of its research output. 2003 founding of Hamburg School of Logistics (HSL) 2004 MBA-degree program – full-time 2005 Accreditation of full-time MBA Programs by ASIIN 2006 MBA-degree program – part-time 2006 First Summer School – part-time 2007 renaming and change of legal status to Kühne School of Logistics and Management at the TUHH 2007 Master-degree program International Engineering and Management – full-time 2008 Accreditation of the part-time MBA-Programs by ASIIN 2008 Master-degree program logistics, Infrastructure and mobility – full-time KLU Foundation and Milestones 2010 Founding and German state-recognition of KLU 2012 KLU awarded the Erasmus University Charter by the European Union 2013 Opening of KLU’s campus in the HafenCity by current German Chancellor Olaf Scholz 2017 KLU granted the right to confer PhD degrees 2020 10th anniversary under the motto of "10 Years of Award-Winning Teaching and Research" 2021 KLU wins the Global Student Satisfaction Award by Studyportals KLU offers international programs, which are taught exclusively in English: Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Business Administration with four profiles: international management, sustainable management, supply chain management, and digital management & innovation.
