Pvris (pronounced "Paris" and stylized PVRIS) is an American pop rock band formed in Lowell, Massachusetts in 2012. Following several lineup changes, the band is now composed of frontwoman Lynn Gunn and bassist Brian MacDonald. Pvris has released four studio LPs: White Noise (2014) featuring the hits "You and I", and "My House", All We Know of Heaven, All We Need of Hell (2017) featuring "What's Wrong", Use Me (2020) featuring "Hallucinations", and Evergreen (2023) featuring "Goddess". The band was formed in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 2009 under the name Operation Guillotine. They were originally a metalcore band, consisting of five members, with Kyle Anthony performing lead vocals. Their line-up soon changed to vocalist/guitarist Lynn Gunn (born Lyndsey Gunnulfsen), guitarist Alex Babinski, bassist Brian Macdonald, and drummer Brad Griffin. On March 26, 2013, Pvris released their self-titled EP. The sound was described as post-hardcore. They played sporadic shows through the Spring, including a mini-tour with Love, Robot. During the summer of 2013, the band played a week on Ernie Ball's Battle of the Bands stage at Warped Tour after winning a contest. On July 18, it was announced that they had signed with Tragic Hero Records, though it was short-lived. It was also during this time, on July 26, that the band officially changed their name from 'Paris' to 'Pvris', citing legal reasons. The band went on The Rise Up Tour supporting A Skylit Drive in September and October. Shortly after the end of the tour, they parted ways with their drummer Brad Griffin, and continued as a trio. Pvris began teasing fans that they would soon be hitting the studio to write and record new material around this time. That recording process began in December when Pvris entered the studio with Blake Harnage of Versa. On February 7, 2014, they officially announced that they were a part of an Acoustic 4 Way Split with A Loss For Words, Wind in Sails and After Tonight which was set to release on April 1, 2014. Coinciding with the release of their Acoustic EP, Pvris joined A Loss For Words, Veara, City Lights, and Moms on the fifth anniversary of The Kids Can't Lose Tour from March 29, 2014, to April 13, 2014. When the band went into the studio their sound changed drastically, incorporating pop and electronic elements into their music. Gunn claimed this incorporation was done subconsciously. In June 2014 it was announced the band had signed to Rise and Velocity. A music video was released for "St. Patrick" on June 24, and the song was also released as a single on the same day. The track peaked at number 4 on the Kerrang! Rock Chart, spending over fifteen weeks in the top 20. In an interview with The Huffington Post Gunn elaborated on the excitement that came with being able to release new music to the public. "We've been waiting over six months to release anything... It feels incredible to finally unleash it to the world. So many more people are into it than we even imagined!" The band played two weeks on the Battle of the Bands stage at Warped Tour. During their time spent on Warped Tour The Huffington Post released a second article listing them as one of "18 Artists You Need To Know Halfway Through 2014". "Lynn Gunn is a force that cannot be denied, redolently poignant in both her most excitable and serene vocalizations. The first female-led signing of Rise Records, a label that has almost implausibly made metalcore music equally accessible and desirable, the label may have just made its smartest acquisition yet." The band supported Mayday Parade in October and November on their The Honeymoon Tour. In early September, the band supported Emarosa on the Up Close and Personal tour. Pvris also joined the Ice Grills 2014 Tour in Japan from September 16, 2014, to September 21, 2014. The tour featured Lyndsey and Brian playing with A Loss For Words, State Champs, as well as Pvris providing acoustic support. On September 22, 2014, Pvris announced their debut album "White Noise" due for release on November 4, 2014. The following day, Pvris released a music video for "My House". On October 6, 2014, Pvris released "The Empty Room Sessions" of My House. On October 16, 2014, Pvris released the self-titled track "White Noise" off of their upcoming debut album. On November 10, 2014, it was announced that Pvris would be supporting Pierce the Veil and Sleeping with Sirens on the second leg of their World Tour, and Mallory Knox will also be supporting them. The tour runs from January 23 to March 4, starting in San Diego and ending in Oklahoma City. On March 25, 2015, Pvris released the official video for 'White Noise'. On June 11, 2015, Pvris won the Relentless Kerrang! Awards 2015 for Best International Newcomer. On June 22, 2015, Pvris released their cover of "Chandelier" by Sia off Punk Goes Pop 6's deluxe edition. On July 2, 2015, Pvris released the official music video for "Holy". On July 21, 2015, Pvris released the official music video for "Fire". The following day, at the Alternative Press Music Awards, they took home the award for Breakthrough Band. The band supported Bring Me the Horizon in the U.S. in October, then supported them the following month in the UK. In February and March, the band supported Fall Out Boy on their tour of the U.S. On January 5, 2016, Pvris made their network television debut by performing "My House" and "White Noise" on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. On February 17, 2016, the band premiered a new song, titled "You and I" on Radio 104.5. The song was released on February 22, along with a music video, and is featured on a deluxe edition of White Noise, released April 22. The deluxe album also included a stripped version of "You and I", as well as a new track "Empty". On May 11, 2016, Pvris set out on their first American headlining tour, which wrapped up on June 10. It was announced that the band will be playing at Chicago's Lollapolooza for the first time on July 29, 2016.

On June 13, Pvris premiered their latest single "What's Wrong" on Annie Mac's BBC Radio 1 show as another addition to the AWKOHAWNOH album. Pvris released a remix of The Aces' single "Last One" on April 26, 2019. The band signed to Reprise/Warner Records after being with Rise, and on July 12, 2019, they released a new single "Death of Me", and an accompanying music video, as their lead single from their EP, Hallucinations. The track debuted at number 1 on the Kerrang Rock Chart. On August 16, 2019 the band released the song/video "Hallucinations" as their second single, which saw the band continue their progression towards a more dance/EDM influenced sound. In the week leading up to the release of the single, the band sent exclusive vinyl copies of the single to their fans. Frontwoman Lynn Gunn later stated on Twitter that those vinyls were a limited edition of only 500 copies. The track saw commercial and critical success, charting for several weeks on Billboard's Alternative Airplay charts, peaking at No. 35. On October 19, 2019, they announced on social media that a five-track EP, Hallucinations, would be released on October 25, 2019. On January 8, 2020 it was announced that they would join Halsey on her Manic World Tour, which ended up being postponed indefinitely due to COVID-19. On March 4, 2020, through some teasing links via their social media channels, they announced their third album, Use Me. On March 4, 2020 the band released "Dead Weight" as the first single from Use Me, and announced a May 1 release date for the album. "Dead Weight" premiered on Annie Mac's BBC Radio 1 show as the "Hottest Record in the World". K. Flay collaborated on the single, which was described as dark pop. The music video for "Dead Weight" was filmed in Milan, Italy. On April 8, 2020, the band announced that the release of Use Me had been delayed to July 10, 2020, and on July 2 the band announced a further delay to August 28, 2020. A deluxe edition of the album was released on October 22, 2020. On August 26, 2020, the band announced that guitarist Alex Babinski was no longer in the band due to sexual misconduct allegations. Babinski released a statement shortly after, strongly denying the allegations while stating he would take legal action, but stated that he understood the decision made by Gunn and MacDonald. Said accusations were later dropped in 2023 when the accuser recanted their statement; neither Gunn or MacDonald have publicly commented on the false allegations. In late July, Pvris began teasing their forthcoming single with a cryptic website sweatblvvdtears.com, containing ten Roman numerals that incrementally revealed symbols and clues pertaining to the song and its release. On July 28, the single artwork was revealed at the Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris, France, ahead of the single's official release on July 30. The music video, directed by Katharine White in Los Angeles, premiered on August 5 via YouTube. On October 10, 2022, Pvris began teasing their next two singles on Twitter.

On March 30, 2023, Pvris announced that their fourth album Evergreen would be released on July 14, 2023.
