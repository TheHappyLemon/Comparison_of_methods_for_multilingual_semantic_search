Chalcone is the organic compound C6H5C(O)CH=CHC6H5. It is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. A variety of important biological compounds are known collectively as chalcones or chalconoids. They are widely known bioactive substances, fluorescent materials, and chemical intermediates. Chalcones have two absorption maxima at 280 nm and 340 nm. Chalcones and chalconoids are synthesized in plants as secondary metabolites. The enzyme chalcone synthase, a type III polyketide synthase, is responsible for the biosynthesis of these compounds. The enzyme is found in all "higher" (vascular) and several "lower" (non-vascular) plants. Chalcone is usually prepared by an aldol condensation between benzaldehyde and acetophenone. This reaction, which can be carried out without any solvent, is so reliable that it is often given as an example of green chemistry in undergraduate education. Chalcones and their derivatives demonstrate a wide range of biological activities including anti-inflammation. Some 2′-amino chalcones have been studied as potential antitumor agents. Chalcones are of interest in medicinal chemistry and have been described as a privileged scaffold. In medicinal chemistry, chalcones have been used as: antioxidants Anticancer agents antidiabetic drugs antiviral drugs antimalarial drugs and more. In chemical industries, they are employed as: liquid crystals fluorescent chemical scaffolds metal sensors corrosion inhibitors plant hormones. Chalcones have been used as intermediates in heterocyclic synthesis, especially in the synthesis of pyrazoles and aurones. Juliá–Colonna epoxidation Merck Index, 11th Edition, 2028 "Front Matter".
