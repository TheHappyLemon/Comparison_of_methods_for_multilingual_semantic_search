The Horsey Horseless was an early automobile created by Uriah Smith, a Seventh-day Adventist preacher, and inventor, in Battle Creek, Michigan. It contained a wooden horse head and neck attached to the front of the car, intended to make it resemble a horse and carriage so it would not frighten horses on the road. This vehicle is known to have been invented in 1899, but it is unknown whether or not it was ever built. The horse head was hollow, also serving as the fuel tank. It was included in Time Magazine's 2007 list of "The 50 Worst Cars of All Time".
