He then joined Yononishi Junior High School and Urawa Higashi High School. Kawashima has an older brother and older sister. Kawashima started his professional career at Omiya Ardija in J2 League after graduating Urawa Higashi High School. On 6 April 2002, he made his Omiya Ardija debut.

In 2004, Kawashima joined Nagoya Grampus Eight in Japan's J1 League. Over the three seasons, he competed with veteran goalkeeper Seigo Narazaki and served as the club's second choice goalkeeper. At times, Kawashima was given a chance of first team appearances, due to Narazaki suffered an injury. However, Kawashima himself suffered an injury concern after injuring his hand towards the end of the season and was sidelined for four weeks. He went on to make 17 appearances for the side. It was announced on 29 December 2006 that Kawasaki Frontale had signed Kawashima for a transfer fee of 150 million yen. The move was, at the time, the largest transfer fee for a player in the J.League. Kawashima made his Kawasaki Frontale debut as a starter in a 1–0 win over Kashima Antlers in the opening game of the season, keeping a clean sheet. He then made his AFC Champions League debut, in a 3–1 win over Arema. After establishing himself as a first choice goalkeeper he soon received praises for his performances. That season, Kawasaki Frontale became the first Japanese club to qualify for the 2007 AFC Champions League where they finished first in their group. In the knockout rounds, Kawashima allowed no regulation goals in the quarterfinals against Iran's Sepahan club, but lost 5–4 in the penalty shoot-out.

In the 2008 season, Kawashima remained the club's first choice goalkeeper and started the opening game of the season, a 1–1 draw against Tokyo Verdy. He then kept two clean sheets on 30 March 2008 and 2 April 2008 against JEF United Chiba and Consadole Sapporo. Between 26 April 2008 and 6 May 2008, he helped the side win four league matches in a row. Kawashima then kept two consecutive clean sheets between 23 November 2008 and 29 November 2008 against Gamba Osaka and Vissel Kobe. However, Kawasaki Frontale failed to win the league, finishing as runners-up behind winners Kashima Antlers. Until the end of the 2008 season he went on to make 36 appearances (34 in the league) in all competitions. Ahead of the 2009 season, Kawashima was named the club's senior captain. He continued as the club's first choice goalkeeper at the start of the season. He then helped the side win six league matches in a row between 10 May 2009 and 1 July 2009. Along the way, he kept three clean sheets in a row between 20 June 2009 and 1 July 2009. Following this, Kawashima was determined to help Kawasaki Frontale win the league. At the start of October, Kawashima helped the club go on a winning streak against Omiya Ardija, Kashima Antlers and Sanfrecce Hiroshima in the league keeping their fight for the title alive. However, once again, Kawasaki Frontale failed to win the league, they finished as runners-up behind winners Kashima Antlers, while losing 2–0 to FC Tokyo in the J.League Cup Final. At the end of the 2009, Kawashima was named in the J. League Best Eleven and also won the Individual Fair-Play award for the first time in his career. He made a total of 47 appearances (34 in the league) in all competitions. Ahead of the 2010 season, Kawashima was linked with a move away from Kawasaki Frontale, but ultimately stayed at the club. He stayed as the club's first choice goalkeeper at the start of the season. Prior to an AFC Champions League match against Melbourne Victory on 31 March 2010, Kawashima suffered a hand injury in training, but made his recovery and started the whole game, as Kawasaki Frontale lost 1–0. He went on to make 17 appearances for the side in all competitions. After participating in the 2010 World Cup, Kawashima completed a move to Europe by joining Lierse S.K. in the Belgian Pro League. Upon joining the club, he signed a two–year contract with an option to extend. About the move Kawashima said, "After I experienced the World Cup, I thought that putting myself in a more competitive environment is the only way I can get better." Kawashima made his Lierse debut in a 1–0 loss against Sint-Truidense in the opening game of the season. After making his Lierse debut, Kawashima quickly became the club's first choice goalkeeper. However, the club struggled at the start of the season and suffered five defeats in the first five matches, but Kawashima impressed the side with saves. On 25 September 2010, he kept his first clean in a 1–0 win over Charleroi, the side's first win in the league of the season. In mid–October, Kawashima suffered a groin injury that kept him out throughout the month. He then returned to the starting line-up on 10 November 2010, helping the side beat RFC Tournai 4–1 in the round of 16 of the Belgian Cup. Next, Kawashima went on a run of conceding a total of 24 goals in the league for the rest of 2010, as the club suffered heavy defeats, including a 7–0 loss against Standard Liège on 27 November 2010, a 3–1 loss against K.V.

After helping Japan win the Asian Cup, he did not return as a starting goalkeeper on 12 February 2011 against Germinal Beerschot in a 2–2 draw. Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Kawashima made an impressed display for the next two matches against Lokeren and Club Brugge, which saw the club secure its status in the league for the next season. In the league's Europa League Playoffs, he kept another clean sheet, in a 0–0 draw against Cercle Brugge on 2 April 2011. The club finished second place behind Cercle Brugge in the league's Europa League playoffs. At the end of the 2010–11 season, having made 30 appearances in all competitions, Kawashima won the club's player of the season award. Ahead of the 2011–12 season, Kawashima was linked a move away from Lierse, with clubs like Fulham, West Bromwich Albion and VVV-Venlo keen on signing him. At the start of the 2011–12 season, Kawashima remained first choice goalkeeper for the side and then kept his first clean sheet in a 0–0 draw against Genk on 6 August 2011. He then managed two clean sheets between 17 September 2011 and 24 September 2011 against Cercle Brugge and Westerlo. During the 2011–12 season, he was credited by Manager Chris Janssens for giving the club the best defence. In October 2011, Kawashima was handed the captaincy taking over from Wesley Sonck and played his first match as captain on 15 October 2011, where he helped the side beat Zulte Waregem 2–1. Kawashima again kept two clean sheets between 26 February 2012 and 3 March 2012 against Anderlecht and OH Leuven. He spent the rest of the season continuing his duties as captain. His performance at Lierse led the club begin negotiations over a new contract. At the end of the 2011–12 season, he had played all 30 regular league games and six Europa League Playoff games. Once again, Kawashima won the club's player of the season award. For his performances, he was nominated for Goalkeeper of the Year but lost out to Silvio Proto. On 19 August 2011, during a league match between Lierse and Germinal Beerschot, which Lierse were leading 1–0, Kawashima was subjected to taunts and insults by Beerschot supporters, who chanted "Kawashima-Fukushima!" in reference to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. After being confronted by Kawashima, the referee halted the match for several minutes until order was restored. After the match had ended in a 1–1 draw, Kawashima left the pitch in tears, visibly upset at the insults. Kawashima said, "I can pass on many things, but not that. This is not funny. Using the drama of Fukushima in this manner is not at all funny." After the match, Beerschot released a club statement on the incident: "Our fans have crossed a thin line where a bit of fun turns into something serious. The chants aimed at Lierse goalkeeper Kawashima were offensive and completely out of order". However, Beerschot said that Kawashima was partly to blame: "The Lierse shot-stopper also took part in this as he provoked the Beerschot fans with offensive gestures and facial expressions. Our own goalkeeper Stijn Stijnen on the other hand never reacted to abusive chants and insults from the Lierse faithful." Beerschot further emphasized that it was completely unacceptable to assert insults of this nature. Beerschot's statement caused outrage with Lierse taking the matter to the Royal Belgian Football Association (RBFA) and soon after, Beerschot posted an apology to Japan on their website. The Royal Belgian Football Association (RBFA) fined Beerschot 30,000 Swiss francs (¥2.7 million and US$34,920) and RBFA officials apologized not only to Kawashima, but also to Jun Yokota, the Japanese Ambassador to Belgium, over the incident. However, Beerschot announced their intention to appeal against their decision, based on the amount of fine they received as well as their financial problems. In the end, the Appeals Committee of the KBVB reduced the fines to €16,400 instead. However, the club were still unsatisfied with the fines and in February 2012, the Appeals Committee of the KBVB reduced the fines to €2,480 plus the legal costs. On 22 September 2011, Beerschot formally apologized to Kawashima. Responding to Beerschot's apology, he said: "I myself have no family in the region, but I have been there visiting. People still suffer from the situation. For me, these excuses are sufficient. I also do not think supporters should be allowed to call anything anymore. They must be able to create atmosphere, but there are limits." A year later in October 2012, French television host Laurent Ruquier made a joke about the 'Fukushima effect' and Kawashima after he showed a picture in live audience of composite picture about Kawashima with four arms. This caused outrage from Japan, who criticised Ruquier for "lacking consideration." The next day, Ruquier apologised for the joke. When Beerschot and Lierse met again on 26 December 2011, Kawashima started the whole game, as they drew 0–0. During the match, Beerschot's supporters asked him for forgiveness through the use of banner aimed at the player. On 18 July 2012, Kawashima left Lierse to join Standard Liège on a three-year deal. The move reportedly cost Standard Liège €600,000. Kawashima made his club debut in a 1–0 loss against Zulte Waregem in the opening game of the season. In his first match against his former club Lierse he played the whole game in a 0–0 draw and throughout the match he received standing ovations from Lierse supporters. After making his debut for the club, Kawashima quickly established himself in the first team as a starting goalkeeper. He then kept two clean sheets between 31 October 2012 and 4 November 2012 against Genk and OH Leuven, in two 2–0 victories. He again kept three clean sheets between 18 November 2012 and 2 December 2012 against Zulte Waregem, Lierse and Waasland-Beveren. He kept another three clean sheets between 16 February 2013 and 9 March 2013 against Cercle Brugge, Genk and OH Leuven. As the 2012–13 season progressed, the club became a serious contender for the title in the Championship Playoff. However, Standard Liege's two losses between 5 May 2013 and 12 May 2013 against Anderlecht and Club Brugge cost the side the league title. Kawashima started in every match throughout the 2012–13 season until he was dropped from the squad for the next two matches following his performance against Club Brugge. In a match against Gent for the Europa League spot for next season, Kawashima played in both legs, in a 7–1 win on aggregate. In his first season at Standard Liege he made 40 appearances in all competitions. For his performances, he was nominated for Goalkeeper of the Year but lost out to Silvio Proto for the second time. Ahead of the 2013–14 season, Kawashima was linked with a move away from the club, but no bid was made. Instead, he remained a first choice goalkeeper at the start of the season. Throughout the UEFA Europa League qualifications playoffs campaign, Kawashima helped the side reach the group stage after beating KR, Xanthi and FC Minsk. He started the league season well keeping six clean sheets in the first six league matches. Kawashima later credited the arrival of goalkeeper coach Jos Beckx for his performance and keeping six clean sheets in the first six league matches. However, in late–October, Kawashima suffered a hip injury which made him miss three matches. He then returned from injury on 10 November 2013 against Club Brugge, keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw, and amassed three more clean sheets in the following matches. Kawashima then kept five more clean sheets between 18 January 2014 and 15 February 2014. As the 2013–14 season progressed the club became a title contender again.

He started the league season well keeping a clean sheet in a 3–0 win over Charleroi in the opening game of the season. During a 2–2 draw against K.V. Kortrijk on 2 August 2014, Kawashima made an impressive save for the side described as "world class". However, Kawashima was subject of criticism over his performances after mistakes against Feyenoord, Club Brugge and Zulte Waregem. As a result of his poor performances, Kawashima lost his first choice goalkeeper role to Yohann Thuram-Ulien and was demoted to the substitute bench. He then played twice during December against Lokeren and Feyenoord, in two losses. Despite losing his first choice goalkeeper role for the rest of the season, Kawashima finished with 19 appearances in all competitions. At the end of the 2014–15 season, he subsequently left the club when his contract expired to pursue more first team football after losing his place to Thuram-Ulien. Scottish Premiership club Dundee United applied for a UK work permit to sign Kawashima in November 2015. The signing was confirmed on 29 December, after the work permit had been approved. Upon joining the club, Kawashima was described as a "fantastic coup" by Manager Mixu Paatelainen. He made his debut for the club against city rivals Dundee on 2 January 2016, losing 2–1. However, Kawashima's performance received criticism when he was at fault for conceding soft goals. Nevertheless, he managed to keep three clean sheets against Hamilton Academical, Ross County and St. Johnstone. However, the club were relegated after again losing 2–1 to Dundee on 2 May 2016.

Ahead of the 2017–18 season, Kawashima announced his intention to stay at Metz for another season. Kawashima started the 2017–18 season on the bench, with Didillon preferred as the first choice goalkeeper. However, following the club's first three defeats, Kawashima played his first match of the season, and made some impressive saves in a 1–0 loss against SM Caen on 26 August 2017. He was then sent off in the 50th minute for a professional foul on Adama Diakhaby in a 3–1 loss against AS Monaco on 21 January 2018. After serving a one match suspension, he returned to the starting lineup in a 2–1 win over OGC Nice on 27 January 2018. Over the next two months, Kawashima's performance earned him the club's Player of the Month award for February and March. Kawashima reassured his team with a series of excellent displays and as a result, he cemented himself as the club's number one as they fought relegation. His form for Metz earned him a recall to the Japan national team, where he went on to reclaim the number one jersey.
