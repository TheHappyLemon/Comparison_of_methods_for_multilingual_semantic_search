On January 19, 2023, Älihan Smailov was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors of National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna. Following the outbreak of violent 2022 Kazakh unrest, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev appointed Smaiylov as the acting Prime Minister on 5 January 2022, in response to the resignation of his predecessor Askar Mamin and his cabinet. According to Joanna Lillis from Eurasianet, Smaiylov along with other ministers is a technocrat with role in "carrying the baggage" of a "tainted cabinet" and that his appointment as the head of government would provide more clues in Tokayev's future policies. On 11 January 2022, the Mäjilis, the lower house of the Kazakh Legislature, approved Smaiylov as the new prime minister with 89 deputies from all parties unanimously voting in favour for his candidacy. President Tokayev at the session asserted that Smaiylov's view on Kazakhstan's future economy being "correct" and that he had "a precise plan". From there, Smaiylov himself thanked for support and remarked it as a "great responsibility" and praised Tokayev's existing policies. With 9 out of 20 total ministers being new appointees, Smaiylov's cabinet faced tasks in improving the quality of life for citizens, maintaining economic growth, dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, restoring the widescale damage and leading Kazakhstan out of the aftermath caused by the unrest. At the first meeting with cabinet of ministers, Smaiylov proclaimed that the government "must justify the high confidence of the head of state at this difficult moment for the whole country." On 5 February 2024, Smaiylov and his cabinet resigned. He was replaced by his deputy and acting Prime Minister, Roman Sklyar. The next day, the official new Prime Minister, Oljas Bektenov was appointed. "Protests in Kazakhstan over High Fuel Prices - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency". novinite.com.
