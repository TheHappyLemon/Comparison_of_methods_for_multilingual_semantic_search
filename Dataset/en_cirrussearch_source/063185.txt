Adams was born in Dutchess County, New York, to Melissa Russo. Tyler credits much of the success in his life to his mother's unwavering devotion to him. Examples of this include Melissa driving the over 150 mile round trip to the Red Bulls facility before Tyler was old enough to make the journey himself. Melissa raised Tyler for most of his early years on her own. Eventually Melissa married Daryl Sullivan and his three sons became an essential part of Tyler's life. He is of African American descent through his father. His stepfather, Daryl Sullivan, coached soccer at the high school and college levels.[citation needed] Adams graduated from Roy C.
