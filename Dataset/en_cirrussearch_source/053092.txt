A deposit is the act of placing cash (or cash equivalent) with some entity, most commonly with a financial institution, such as a bank. The deposit is a credit for the party (individual or organization) who placed it, and it may be taken back (withdrawn) in accordance with the terms agreed at time of deposit, transferred to some other party, or used for a purchase at a later date.

Transaction accounts (known as "checking" or "current" accounts depending on the country) can be used to pay other parties, while savings accounts are typically payable only to the depositor or another bank account, and may have limits on the frequency of withdrawal.
