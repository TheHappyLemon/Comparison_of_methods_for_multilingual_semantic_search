McLaughlin has opened up about the microaggressions he experienced as the only black actor in the main cast of Stranger Things, stating "My very first Comic-Con, some people didn't stand in my line because I was black...Sometimes overseas you feel the racism, you feel the bigotry. Sometimes it's hard to talk about and for people to understand, but when I was younger it definitely affected me a lot." "Sean Hayes/Stranger Things Kids/Sheryl Crow". The Ellen DeGeneres Show.
