Madona (pronunciation; German: Modohn) is a town with town rights in the Zemgale region of Latvia and is the center of the Madona municipality. The surrounding area of Madona had been populated in earlier times, which is confirmed by discoveries of old burial grounds in the city's vicinity. Madona is first mentioned in writing in 1461, when Archbishop Sylvester began renting the lands of Birži Manor. However, the Swedish government placed the land under state control.
