Curd snack, cottage cheese bar or curd cheese bar is a type of sweet dairy food made from glazed or unglazed curd cheese with or without filling. They were created[citation needed] and became ubiquitous in the Soviet Union. Nowadays, curd snacks are popular in the former Soviet Union, such as the Baltic states, Russia and Ukraine, as well as in some former Soviet-aligned ones, such as Hungary (túró rudi), Poland, Romania and Mongolia. The main part of a curd snack is made from curd cheese, which is mixed with sugar, sweeteners or other ingredients and milled into a homogenous paste that is pressed into the desired shape and filled with jam or other fillings. The formed bars then pass through the so-called 'glaze waterfall' that coats them in chocolate or another type of glaze. Finally, the curd snacks are cooled in a cooling tunnel and packed. The mass production of curd snacks began in the 1950s in the Soviet Union and they quickly gained popularity. Initially, they were flavoured with simple ingredients, such as vanilla, cocoa and raisins, but since the 1990s the curd snacks have become more varied and also contain ingredients such as cookie bites, apricot, strawberry jam and boiled condensed milk. In 2012, the Kārums curd snack was voted the favorite product by Latvian consumers, receiving 20% of the votes. Curd snacks have also remained highly popular in Estonia. According to a 2010 consumer survey, 74% of Estonians ate as much or even more curd snacks than before, with 57% preferring local curd snack brands over imported ones. In 2013, Estonia set the world record for the biggest curd snack, which weighed 537 kilograms. Curd snacks have also remained highly popular in Lithuania. Some popular curd snack brands include Kārums, Kohuke, Nykštukas and Magija. Twinkie Gansito Cornall, Jim (October 19, 2018). "Glazed curd cheese bars – ripe for expansion?". Dairy Reporter.
