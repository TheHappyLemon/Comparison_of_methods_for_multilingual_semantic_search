Maciej Rybus ([ˈmat͡ɕɛj ˈrɨbus] ; born 19 August 1989) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a left-back for Russian club Rubin Kazan. He previously played for the Poland national team. Rybus began his career with Pelikan Łowicz and was sold to MSP Szamotuły in the summer of 2006, where he played for only one season and was then scouted by Legia Warsaw. He made his debut for Legia on 15 November 2007, in an Ekstraklasa Cup match against Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski. Legia's coach Jan Urban, decided that the player would join the first team. Rybus debuted in the Ekstraklasa on 24 November 2007. He played the 2007–08 season mainly as a substitute but earned a place in the starting eleven towards the end of the season.[citation needed] He scored his first goal in the Ekstraklasa in December 2007 against Górnik Zabrze. In April 2008, Rybus scored a brace in a league match against Wisła Kraków.[citation needed] On 21 June 2016, he signed with Lyon. He played a total of 28 matches for the club. On 19 July 2017, he signed a three-year contract with Russian side Lokomotiv Moscow, which was later renewed. Rybus left Lokomotiv on 31 May 2022 as his contract expired. Throughout his career at the club, he won one league title, two cup titles and a super cup. On 11 June 2022, Rybus signed a two-year contract with Spartak Moscow. He scored his first goal in a 4–1 victory over Fakel Voronezh on 27 August 2022. On 21 June 2023, his contract with Spartak was terminated by mutual consent. On 23 June 2023, it was announced that Rybus had signed a one-year contract with Rubin Kazan. He made his debut in a 1-4 loss to his former club, Spartak, on 5 August 2023. However, he suffered an injury shortly thereafter, ruling him out from playing until the end of the year. Rybus made his debut for the Poland national team against Romania in November 2009. In the next match against Canada, he scored his first goal. He also represented Poland at UEFA Euro 2012. In May 2018 he was named in Poland's preliminary 35-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. On 20 June 2022, following his move to Russian side Spartak Moscow, Poland barred him from playing for his country. Playing for a Russian team during the Russian invasion of Ukraine was cited as the reason. This was despite the fact that the club's owner, Lukoil, was one of the only large Russian companies to have spoken out against the war. Over his career in the national team, Rybus played 66 matches. On 17 March 2018, Rybus married Lana Baimatova, a Russian hospitality manager of Ossetian ethnicity.
