The 2013 UCI World Tour is the fifth edition of the ranking system launched by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 2009. The series started with the Tour Down Under on 22 January. The UCI ProTeams compete in the World Tour, with UCI Professional Continental teams, or national squads, able to enter at the discretion of the organisers of each event. Trek announced that it bought the license of RadioShack Leopard on 26 June 2013. All events from the 2012 UCI World Tour are included. For the second successive year, the Tour of Hangzhou was scheduled originally as part of the tour, but later withdrawn. Notes As Ciolek rides for MTN–Qhubeka, which is not a World Tour team, he was ineligible to score points towards the UCI World Tour standings. The World Team Time Trial Championship gives points only in the team rankings, not in the individual or national standings. Source: Riders tied with the same number of points were classified by number of victories, then number of second places, third places, and so on, in World Tour events and stages. 228 riders scored points. 30 other riders finished in positions that would have earned them points, but they were ineligible as members of non-ProTour teams. Source: Team rankings are calculated by adding the ranking points of the top five riders of a team in the table, plus points gained in the World Team Time Trial Championship (WTTT). Source: National rankings were calculated by adding the ranking points of the top five riders registered in a nation in the table. The national rankings were also used to determine how many riders a country could have in the World Championships. Riders from 35 countries scored points.
