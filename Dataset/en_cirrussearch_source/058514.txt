Ballooning, using gas balloons (which require no power, fuel or motors), was on the Summer Olympic Games programme in 1900. The aeronautical pioneer Henry de La Vaulx set two world records for distance and duration piloting a balloon flight. Nearly all events at the 1900 Games that satisfied four retrospective selection criteria — restricted to amateurs, open to all nations, open to all competitors and without handicapping — are now regarded as Olympic events. Although the ballooning events listed below met these criteria, they have generally not been classified as official. Hot air balloons for manned flight were invented in 1783, but requiring fuel, they proved less practical than the hydrogen balloons that followed almost immediately. Hot air ballooning soon died out, and gas balloons dominated ballooning for nearly 200 years. Gas balloons used hydrogen or coal gas until switching to helium well into the 20th century. The height or altitude of a gas balloon is controlled with ballast weights that can be dropped if the balloon gets too low. In order to land some lifting gas must be vented through a valve. Gas balloons have greater lift for a given volume, so they do not need to be so large, and they can also stay up for much longer than hot air balloons. First three pilots in each event (excluding handicapped events) were as follows (teammate in parentheses, where known): Distance: Comte Henry de La Vaulx FRA 1237 km, Jacques Balsan FRA 1222 km, Jacques Faure FRA 1183 km Duration: Jacques Balsan FRA 35:09, Comte de Castillon de Saint-Victor FRA 18:00, G.

In many works, it is read that the IOC later met to decide which events were Olympic and which were not. This is not correct and no decision has ever been made.
