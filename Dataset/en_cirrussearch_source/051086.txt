The Baikal–Amur Mainline runs along the north side of the river northeast up its valley, crossing between Anamakit and Novy Uoyan and crossing the river a second time upstream before heading into the mountains. The Upper Angara rises at about 1,600 m (5,200 ft) in an area of small glacial lakes of the Delyun-Uran range, right by the Northern Muya Range, Stanovoy Highlands. It its upper course the river flows in a WSW direction across mountainous terrain, with rapids and waterfalls. It enters then a floodplain and crosses the spurs of the Upper Angara and the Barguzin ranges. Near Yanchukan it flows through the Upper Angara tectonic basin. Finally it ends in Lake Baikal forming a delta in the shallow northern end of the lake, separated from the deep part by long sandy spits, including Yarki Island. The Upper Angara is navigable in its last stretch.
