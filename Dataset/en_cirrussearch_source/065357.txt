Deportivo Toluca Fútbol Club S.A. de C.V., commonly known as Club Deportivo Toluca, is a Mexican football club based in Toluca. The club plays in Liga MX, the top-flight of Mexican football from which they have never been relegated.The team was founded on February 12, 1917, by the brothers Manuel Blas and Francisco Juan Henkel Bross owners of the farm "La Huerta" located in Zinacantepec near of Toluca City. Its headquarters are located in the city of Toluca, State of Mexico, playing its home games at the Nemesio Díez Stadium. Toluca has won the Mexican Primera División 10 times, making it the third most winning team, behind América (14) and Guadalajara (12). Besides this, the team has also won two Copa MX and two CONCACAF Champions League. In addition, Toluca won the Mexiquense State Championship 14 times. Despite being one of the oldest teams in Mexico, with more than 100 years of history, the professional era for Toluca began in 1950, 33 years after its foundation, becoming one of the founding teams of the Segunda División de México and the third team with the most seasons in Mexican First Division. According to Mitofsky in 2022, Toluca is the seventh most popular team in Mexico with 3.0% preference with around 4.0 million fans. It is also recognized as one of the classic clubs by FIFA in CONCACAF along with América, Guadalajara, Universidad Nacional, Cruz Azul and Pachuca. Additionally, it is considered by the IFFHS World's Fifth Best Club Team of the Decade in CONCACAF for the first decade of the 21st century (2001–2010). It is considered the team of the 2000s in Mexican soccer, being the team's top winner with four titles. On 12 February 1917, the brothers Román Alday and Gerardo Ferrat alongside Filiberto Navas and Manuel Henkel created Deportivo Toluca Futbol Club. In 1950, the team joined the recently formed Segunda División de México advancing to Mexican Primera División in 1952-53 by having tied with Irapuato by three goals, two by Rubén Pichardo and one by that tournament's goal scorer Mateo de la Tijera having left one more match to play. The team's first official First Division game was against Atlante F.C., and Toluca won this by two goals to one. The team won two consecutive championships in 1966-67 and 1967-68 under coach Ignacio Trelles. In 1974-75 Toluca won the championship one more time after 23 years, coached by Uruguayan Ricardo de León, Toluca played a style of game that was consistently criticized as ultra-defensive but won the championship by defeating León in the final-four mini-tournament 1–0, with the lone goal being scored by Ecuadorian Ítalo Estupiñan. This is the only time the Mexican Championship has been decided by a round-robin, two-legged, mini-tournament. In 1997 Enrique "Ojitos" Meza became the coach of the team, after reaching the finals of the Mexican league with Toros Neza. Toluca resurged, its tactical scheme was very offensive, which was very characteristic of its coach. It was not atypical to see scores like 5–3. The offensive idea suited perfectly the Paraguayan José Saturnino Cardozo, who became the best scorer of the league in four occasions. On his second tournament with the team, Meza led Toluca to win the championship in the Verano 1998 tournament, the first one in twenty years. Finishing the regular season as leader of the tournament with 33 points, Toluca went on to beat Atlante and América in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively. Toluca then faced Necaxa at the final. After losing with the Hidrorrayos in the first leg of the final 1–2 at the Estadio Azteca, Necaxa scored two goals in the first two minutes of the second leg match at the Estadio Nemesio Díez, losing 1–4 at the aggregate score. Toluca then scored five goals with no answer from Necaxa, Taboada at 3', Abundis at 35' and 52', and Cardozo at 58' and 89'. Toluca won the final with a 6–3 aggregate score, winning its fourth title and the first seven titles in the short tournaments era. For the Invierno 1998, Toluca finished second in the regular season behind Cruz Azul, but was eliminated in the Liguilla's first round, losing 2–3 in the aggregate score against Atlas, seeded 7th. The next tournament, Verano 1999, Toluca finished as leader of the tournament again with a record of 12 wins, 3 draws and losing only 2 matches, against Santos Laguna and Atlas. The team defeated Necaxa and Santos Laguna in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively. Toluca went on to play the final against Atlas, second best team of the regular season. After two thrilling matches, a 3–3 draw on the first leg at Estadio Jalisco and a 2–2 tie on the second leg at the Estadio Nemesio Díez, the championship was defined in penalties; Toluca won 5–4. With Enrique Meza as coach, Toluca won the championship three times in a period of three years. Meza left the team in October 2000 to manage Mexico national football team. In the Invierno 2001 tournament Ricardo La Volpe became the coach of Toluca. He, along with Cardozo and Vicente Sánchez had one of the most successful and exciting teams in years. However, La Volpe left Toluca with a few weeks left in the season, but without him, they still won their 7th title. At the end of the Apertura 2005 tournament, the team became champions again, beating Monterrey by an aggregate of 6–3, after the questionable decisions of Mexican referee Marco Rodriguez "El Chiquidracula", who expelled three players from Monterrey on their first foul committed. In Apertura 2006, they tied in the first leg (1-1) but suffered a loss in the Estadio Nemesio Díez (2-1) against Guadalajara. In the Clausura 2007 tournament, Toluca had one of their worst seasons, finishing in last place. In the Copa Libertadores 2007, they made it to the round of 16, where they were subsequently eliminated by Cúcuta Deportivo from Colombia. Following the elimination from both tournaments, Gallego resigned from his position stating the need for a year off as his reason for resigning from Club Toluca. José Pekerman, former coach of the Argentine national team, was appointed as head coach of Club Toluca on May 30, 2007. Club Toluca failed to qualify for the 2008 Copa Libertadores. On the Apertura 2008, Toluca had a weak start under their new coach, Jose Manuel "El Chepo" De La Torre, on one point going on a four-game streak of only draws. On the last five games of the regular season, they reversed the tying streak, making 13 points out of a possible 15, ending the regular season in 2nd place overall with 27 points and thus advancing to the playoffs. Their goalkeeper Hernan Cristante set a record by not allowing any goals for 773 minutes. Toluca would go on to win the Bicentenario 2010 tournament by beating Santos Laguna in a dramatic penalty shoot-out, earning them the tenth cup win, the same amount as Club América. Besides winning the domestic title ten times, Toluca has also been the Runner-Up of the Mexican domestic tournament six times. On the Apertura 2012, Toluca finished first place and therefore earned a place for the Copa Libertadores. On the Ligullia of the Apertura 2012, Toluca went all the way to the final and lose to Club Tijuana 4-1 aggregate. On the Cluasura 2013, Toluca finished 13th and did not qualify for the Ligullia. At the end of that season then coach Enrique Meza resigned his job. The next day Toluca contacted its top scorer former player José Cardozo as its new head coach. On May 31, 2016, José Luis Real is presented as director of sports development and a new project is presented as technical director, headed by Hernán Cristante, who would arrive with another reference of the club such as Enrique Alfaro together with Joaquín Velázquez as his technical assistants, during the process, Sinha was to end his successful career within the club, then he managed to bring the goalkeeper on loan Luis García as the only transfer, with a solid base within the club after the losses of Richard Ortiz, Christian Cueva, Heriberto Vidales and Lucas Lobos at the end of the contract, and Liborio Sánchez, Christian Pérez, Mario Quezada, Nicolás Saucedo and Omar Arellano who ended their loan, other players were Daniel González and Héctor Acosta who were loaned to Chiapas and Alebrijes in the same order, were not incorporated into the current team and their loans to other teams were renewed Chivas and Venados F.C. respectively, while the team was in the preseason, David Rangel joined the coaching staff who will achieve as a player of the institution to be captain and champion in the years 1998, 1999, and 2000 with Enrique Alfaro and with Hernán Cristante in 1999 and 2000, while in 2005 he also won the title with Sinha. For the part of foreign player transfers for the Apertura 2016, an old acquaintance would arrive again, who was champion at the club in 2010, the Chilean Osvaldo González, plus the Brazilian Maikon Leite who previously in 2014 played in Mexico for Atlas FC; other transfers were Rodrigo Gómez , Pablo Barrientos, Antonio Pedroza, and Jesús Méndez. Deportivo Toluca found themselves playing at home at the Estadio Universitario Alberto "Chivo" Córdoba, because Estadio Nemesio Díez was undergoing remodeling work for the next celebration of 100 years. Starting Clausura 2017, Estadio Nemesio Díez fully ready, Rodrigo Salinas, Gabriel Hauche, Efraín Velarde, and Rubens Sambueza arrived as transfers. In that tournament they reached the semifinals where they were eliminated by Club Deportivo Guadalajara, which ultimately became the champion. Later in the Apertura 2017 tournament they reached the quarterfinals as fifth place, being defeated by Monarcas Morelia. By 2018, there were surprising transfers of Luis Quiñones, Leonel Lopez and Angel Reyna. They reached the final of the Copa MX, being defeated by Club Necaxa. While in the league tournament Toluca was the general leader, dramatically eliminating Morelia in the quarterfinals, in the semifinals they beat Club Tijuana and in the final they faced Santos Laguna, a team they had already beaten in the late years 2000 and 2010. This time the "laguneros" were the champions with an aggregate score of 3–2. For Apertura 2018, Toluca signed William da Silva, Adolfo Dominguez, Amaury Escoto, Richard Ruiz, Luis Ángel Mendoza, Héctor Acosta, Fernando Tobio and the return of Enrique Triverio, during the tournament he spent all 17 days in Liguilla positions, to culminate 7th. In the quarterfinals they faced America, who would ultimately be champion, being eliminated by a 5-4 aggregate. In the following tournament Cristante is kept, in his first two matches the team remains as Super Leader, but then there was a streak of 6 games without a win, 5 losses and a draw. In which Cristante was dismissed and his replacement was Ricardo La Volpe who began his second stage, during the La Volpe stage there was improvement, but it was not possible to qualify for the league. During the 2019 Apertura, La Volpe remained in the technical direction, but his results did not improve, having his worst results since 2001. La Volpe resigned in the absence of a day to complete and the team finished in third to last position with 17 points. For the 2020 Clausura, the tournament was temporarily suspended as of March 15, and after having decided to play the matches on matchday 10 behind closed doors, all as a consequence of the health contingency due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. The postponement of the contest reached a critical point, until on May 22, 2020, the Liga MX Extraordinary Assembly decreed the end of the tournament before its regular date, leaving the competition without a champion. Toluca finished the tournament in the 15th position, product of 2 wins, 4 draws and 4 losses, obtaining 10 points. For the Guardianes 2020 and 2021 tournaments, Toluca finished in the 11th position, so it had to play reclassification to a single game, facing Tigres, losing 2–1 in Monterrey, with this result, Toluca ended its participation in the tournament. For the next tournament, Toluca finished again in the eleventh position, again playing reclassification to a single match, this time they faced the current champion León, being a complicated match, again visitor due to their position in the table, they won in a round of penalties, after drawing 2–2 in regular time, winning on penalties 2–4, accessing the quarterfinals, facing Cruz Azul, In a fairly disputed match, round trip ended in the Aztec stadium, losing 4–3 in favor of Cruz Azul and in this way Toluca culminated its participation in the tournament, highlighting the individual scoring championship of Toluqueño player Alexis Canelo with 11 annotations. For the Apertura 2021 tournament, Toluca made a more remarkable performance than the previous tournaments, culminating in position number 6, playing reclassification again, but this time locally, although it did not help much, since Toluca was defeated by Pumas with a score 1–2 in the match at the Nemesio Diez, culminating again in a reclassification match. For many years the fans of Deportivo Toluca were very few, because after winning their third title in 1975 against the legendary Club León, the team registered a significant decline, ranking for many years in positions less than half of the board; As if that were not enough, with the passage of time the long tournaments disappeared and the relegation became a matter of percentage which was closely linked to the results achieved by the institutions in recent years. This evidently affected Deportivo Toluca, placing it in a fighting situation for non-relegation. With such poor results and serious problems, the fans in Toluca preferred to support other teams, mainly from the capital such as Club Universidad Nacional and América, until the '98 season after the arrival by José Saturnino Cardozo that Toluca would reach a final and the fans would begin to appear in the stadium. The golden era began and the fans began to organize, giving birth to the Barra Perra Brava, an entertainment group that is located in the sun stands and gained great popularity when it began to "take off its shirts" every time the team scored a goal. regardless of weather conditions. As time went by, the stands of the Nemesio Díez Stadium began to register greater entries and new animation groups began to emerge. Currently, on the official site of the Deportivo Toluca Fútbol Club, five animation groups are registered for the institution; the classic Perra Brava, Los Hijos del Averno, La Banda del Rojo, Garra Diablos and La Fuerza Roja, although evidently there are other unregistered bars that also occupy the stands of the stadium. The most common nickname of the team is "red devils", a tradition that began with the promotion of Toluca to the First Division in 1953; During the amateur era, Toluca's colors were blue and white, however as time went by the team began to use the red color that identifies it to this day. The club's mascot appeared for the first time in August 1953 when Deportivo Toluca formally debuted in the First Division against the Atlante colts in the Ciudad de los Deportes; Since then the nickname of the red devils was born. Toluca also has other nicknames used less frequently to refer to the team; such as: los escarlatas due to the color of their uniform or los choriceros, chorizo ​​being one of the characteristic foods of the city of Toluca. According to Mitofsky in 2022, Toluca is the seventh most popular team in Mexico with 3.0% preference with around 4.0 million fans. The first facilities of the Deportivo Toluca F.C. were located on the old Avenida Colón (today Paseo Colón) in the City of Toluca and basically consisted of a small soccer field and some wooden stands with a covered area reserved for the ladies. In 1919 the then president of the team; Román Ferrat acquired the so-called "Gachupines Dam" to convert it into the new headquarters of Toluca. In this field, Deportivo Toluca received a visit from a team from the capital for the first time; the Real Club España who by then was already four-time champion of the Mexican League. The "Presa de Gachupines" was the official field of Deportivo Toluca for a few years, because in 1921 the team began to use the "Campo del Tívoli" as the official venue of the Mexican State Championship. At the Tivoli (located three blocks from the Nemesio Díez Stadium); Deportivo Toluca received a visit from a foreign team for the first time, this being Libertad from Costa Rica. By qualifying for the Second Division; Tivoli was established as the official headquarters of Toluca already in professional soccer; However, a year later, in 1952, the team began to use "Campo Patria" as a new headquarters and on which the Nemesio Díez Stadium would be built. During the 1940s and 1950s, Toluca played its home games at a ground near downtown Toluca known then as Tivoli. Later, wooden stands were built in the ground and it was named Campo Patria. On that same spot, in 1953, the club started building its own stadium. The stadium was inaugurated on Sunday 8 August 1954, with a match between Deportivo Toluca F.C. and Yugoslavian team GNK Dinamo Zagreb. The game was won by Dinamo 4–1. The only goal for Toluca and also the first in the history of the stadium was scored by Enrique Sesma. Initially, the stadium was opened as Estadio Club Deportivo Toluca. That name lasted until 1955, when it was changed to Estadio Héctor Barraza. Other names the stadium has had are: Estadio Luis Gutiérrez Dosal (1959–1970), Estadio Toluca 70 (1970–1986), Estadio Toluca 70–86 (1986–2000). After the death of Nemesio Díez Riega, president and then owner of the club, in June 2000, the stadium name was changed to Estadio Nemesio Díez. With an investment of 800 million mexican pesos (about 40 million united states dollars), the announcement to remodel The Nemesio Diez stadium by 2017 was made, when Club Deportivo Toluca celebrates its centenary and does so with a remodeled and more functional stadium. Within the Nemesio Diez, four macro support columns that will sustain the stadium structure will be built to replace the current columns obstructing visibility. In the shadow stands, a second level will be built so the capacity, which currently stands at 22,000 will increase to 30,000. The project also includes four giant screens at each end of the building, replacement of all seats and a sunroof in the preferred (shaded) section, to assist in the process of maintaining the natural grass in the field. The remodeled stadium officially opened on January 15, 2017, with a league match against Club America. The first goal was scored by Gabriel Hauche for Toluca with a screamer outside of the box. Toluca FC won that match 2–1. The stadium was completed in the summer 2017 where it had been confirmed that the club would play against Atlético Madrid for the official inauguration of the remodeled stadium. Is a multi-use stadium in Toluca, Mexico, on the campus of the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México. The stadium seats 32,000 and is used mostly for football matches. During the reconstruction of the Estadio Nemesio Díez, Toluca's top-flight soccer club, Deportivo Toluca, played its home matches at Estadio Universitario for over a year. This period was longer than the club expected; while plans were to return to Nemesio Díez in September 2016, these were scrapped. Construction of the stadium began between 1957 and 1958 as a municipal facility for the city of Toluca, with a formal opening on 5 November 1964. It is named for Alberto "Chivo" Córdoba, who coached the UAEM American football team. Between 1974 and 1976, the mural Aratmósfera was painted on the west side stands by Leopoldo Flores. It depicts a man reaching toward the sky to touch light. In 2005, the eastern stands were covered and converted to seats. 1917: The uniform was in charge of Joaquín Lajous but it was designed by Román Ferrat and differs greatly from the current one: White shirt, dark blue pants with a vertical white stripe, dark blue socks. 1925: The uniform undergoes a modification, a blue stripe appears across the chest and the traditional shield with the letters "CDT" in red on the chest. 1929: The shirt is completely dyed red and the shorts turn white, however, the shield leaves the outfit, this uniform is only used for a game against "A.D.O." from Orizaba. 1930: The team appears with a red shirt and blue shorts, but continues without the shield. 1932: The uniform is modified once again, this time not for aesthetic reasons, but rather due to the economic problems that plagued the club, so from that year on Deportivo Toluca wore a red shirt and white shorts with red socks , the shield was still absent from the Mexican attire. 1932 - 1997: Deportivo Toluca used it for many years: Red shirt, white pants, red socks. Currently this (retro) uniform is used in international competitions such as the Concacaf Champions League, the Copa Sudamericana and the Copa Libertadores. 1998 - 2010: The Deportivo Toluca uniform becomes all red: Red shirt, red pants, red socks. This uniform is used from the Verano 98 tournament, curiously when Toluca manages to win the crown again after 23 years. He had 3 sponsors during this period: Corona Sport, Diadora and atlética (the latter brand being the one with which he was crowned the most times in this period of time). 2010 - 2011: Club Deportivo Toluca ends relations with Atlética and changes to Under Armour; He continues playing with red shorts, however the shirt undergoes a modification; Although the base remains red, a white horizontal stripe appears at chest height. 2011 - 2012: The shirt continues with the Under Armor sports brand. The design consists of 4 parallel lines in the shape of a "V" with the shield on the right and the brand logo on the left. The shorts stay red as do the socks. 2012 - 2013: This time, Under Armor proposes an innovative design to the team. White stripes on the arms and a wine-colored stripe on the breast with a zig-zag inlaid fork design. The shorts and socks maintain the red colors. In the 2013 Copa Libertadores, Deportivo Toluca used a black jersey with a white stripe at the chest. 2013 - 2014: Returning to the classic values of the Deportivo Toluca t-shirts, Under Armor launches a classic collection, remembering the t-shirts of the 00's. A thin white stripe that surrounds the "v"-shaped neck and another pair that surrounds the sleeves. For the first time since the American brand sponsors the team, Toluca launches a jersey with a "retro" shield from the 60's era in gray for the Concacaf champions tournament. 2014 - 2015: As a tribute to the fans who cheer from the Sol stands of the Nemesio Díez stadium, the Under Armor brand makes a t-shirt with a sublimated design on the front and back with the appearance of said area of the scarlet venue. The design is repeated on the sleeves of the away shirt, and on the inside of the neck of the sweaters. Once again, a "retro" t-shirt is launched, this time in black, as a third uniform option. 2015 - 2017: The red jersey features a white stripe that runs from the middle of the chest to shoulder height, covering the area of the shield and the brand that makes the shirt. The neck and sleeves are in the same tone of red, with a small stripe above the cut of the sleeve in white. The away shirt uses a more conservative style, applying red sleeves and a slight stripe in the same tone at the bottom of the shirt, covering the sides. The third option is in purple, repeating the design of the home, but with purple as the main color and black as the secondary color, applying white details, and using a "retro" shield.
