Manuel Amoros (born 1 February 1962) is a French former professional footballer who played as a right-back. He was capped 82 times for France, and played in the UEFA European Championships finals of 1984 and 1992, and the FIFA World Cup finals in 1982 and 1986. Born in Nîmes, Gard, Amoros played most of his career for Monaco in the French first division. He missed his penalty in the 1991 European Cup Final for Marseille and subsequently Red Star Belgrade won the match 5–3 on penalties.[citation needed] Amoros was born in France to Spanish parents, escaping from Francisco Franco's regime. He represented the France national team. It was his stints with the Tricolor during the 1982 and 1986 World Cups in which he stood out. In the 1982 semi-final against West Germany, he hit the crossbar in the 89th minute,[citation needed] and in the penalty shoot-out he converted his kick before France were eventually eliminated.[citation needed] In the 1984 European Championships held in France, Amoros showed an egregious side of him when, during the opening game against Denmark, he was sent off for head-butting the Danish midfielder Jesper Olsen. He was banned for three games. However, in the final against Spain, national coach Michel Hidalgo used him as a substitute in a game that Les Bleus won by 2–0 at the Parc des Princes.[citation needed] At the 1986 World Cup, the 24-year-old Amoros was voted among the best defenders of the tournament by the international press.[citation needed] In June 2010, Amoros was appointed national team manager for the Comoros Islands, which coached to September 2010. In January 2012, he was named new coach of Benin, replacing Edme Codjo, who had been in charge since August 2011.
