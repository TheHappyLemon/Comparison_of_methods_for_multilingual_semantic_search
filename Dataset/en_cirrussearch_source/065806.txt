Alexandria Loutitt (born 7 January 2004) is a Canadian ski jumper. She is the first ski jumper from Canada to win a gold medal at the World Championships and the first Canadian woman to win a World Cup individual competition. Loutitt trains in Slovenia, as the ski jumping facility at the Canada Olympic Park in Calgary was shut down. Loutitt became captivated with ski jumping while watching the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. She attended the National Sports School in Calgary, Alberta, which allowed her to spend several months a year in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany for training as a teenager before joining the Canadian national team. Loutitt competed in four events at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2021, finishing 46th on the normal hill, 38th on the large hill, 11th on the women's team normal hill and 10th in the mixed team normal hill. In December 2021, Loutitt had her season's best performance on the World Cup circuit with a 14th-place finish in the large hill event in Lillehammer. In January 2022, Loutitt was named to Canada's 2022 Olympic team. On 7 February, Loutitt won the bronze medal as part of Canada's entry into the mixed team competition. This was Canada's first ever Olympic medal in ski jumping. In March 2022, Loutitt would win the bronze medal at the 2022 Nordic Junior World Ski Championships in the women's normal hill event. In January 2023, Loutitt won the normal hill event at the World Cup stop in Zaō, Japan. This marked the first ever victory for a Canadian woman in the competition. The next month, she also became the first Canadian woman to win a world junior title in ski jumping, taking the individual normal hill gold in front of home fans in Whistler, British Columbia. In March, Loutitt became the first-ever Canadian ski jumping world champion, winning the women's large hill event at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2023 in Planica, Slovenia. On 18 March 2023, in the first ever women's ski flying event in Vikersund, Loutitt set a new female world record with 222 metres (728 ft). Her record was surpassed the next day by Ema Klinec.
