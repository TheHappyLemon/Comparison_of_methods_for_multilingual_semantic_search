The Argolic Gulf (Greek: Αργολικός κόλπος, romanized: Argolikós kólpos), also known as the Gulf of Argolis, is a gulf of the Aegean Sea off the east coast of the Peloponnese, Greece. It is about 50 km long and 30 km wide. Its main port is Nafplio, at its northwestern end. At the entrance to the gulf is the island Spetses. This gulf and its islands are sometimes combined with the Saronic Gulf and Saronic Islands, with the result called the Argo-Saronic Gulf and the Argo-Saronic Islands. It is surrounded by two regional units: Arcadia to the southwest and Argolis to the north and east. The river Inachos drains into the Argolic Gulf near Nea Kios. The main islands in the gulf are Psili, Plateia and Bourtzi, a small island with a Venetian fortress that protects the port of Nafplio. The surrounding mountains protect it from the strong summer Meltemi wind. The main towns that lie around the gulf are, from southwest to east: Tyros Paralio Astros Myloi Nea Kios Nafplio Tolo or Tolon, on Tolo Bay Porto Cheli Spetses Argolic Gulf - view from Tolo The island and Apostolou Church Argolic Gulf View of the Argolic Gulf from the Palamidi in Nafplio Argolic Gulf - view from Nafplion Bourtzi Tower View of Nafplion, Bourtzi and Argolic Gulf Sailboat on the Argolic Gulf near the harbour of Nafplio View of the Argolic Gulf from the Palamidi fortress in Nafplio, Greece Gulf of Argolis at the Encyclopædia Britannica Media related to Argolic Gulf at Wikimedia Commons
