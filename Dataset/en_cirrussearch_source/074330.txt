In the Philippines, this was the only leap year with 365 days, when December 31 was skipped as December 30 was immediately followed by January 1, 1845, the next day after. The change also applied to Caroline Islands, Guam, Marianas Islands, Marshall Islands and Palau as part of the Captaincy General of the Philippines; these became the first places on Earth to redraw the International Date Line.
