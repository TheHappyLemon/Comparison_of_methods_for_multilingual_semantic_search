MTV Lithuania & Latvia was a twenty-four-hour music and entertainment channel operated by MTV Networks Europe. The channel was originally formed in September 2006 at Lithuania, at January 2009 it got re-formed to double channel including both Lithuania and Latvia and targeted audiences in Lithuania and Latvia. In 2006, MTV Networks Europe established MTV Networks Baltic a new broadcasting service which provided localized channels for Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. MTV Networks Baltic launched three separate channels within the region in September, 2006. Initially, MTV Networks Baltic comprised MTV Latvia, MTV Lithuania and MTV Estonia. But due to financial difficulties with the region heightened by the global economic downturn, MTV Networks International merged MTV Latvia and MTV Lithuania to form MTV Lithuania and Latvia in January 2009. MTV Estonia remained as stand alone channel. The first video to air on MTV in the Baltic region was Justice vs. Simian – "We Are Your Friends". In 2008, MTV Networks International signed a new licensing agreement with Israeli Communications company Ananey Communications to continue to operate and manage the MTV brand within the Baltic Region. The channel ceased broadcasting on 19 November 2009. As of 19 November 2009 MTV Europe has replaced MTV Baltic channels. Lithuania receives MTV Europe and other Viacom international channels, distributed by "Starworks LT". The channel combined local and international music, as well as MTV's trademark shows such as Pimp My Ride, Celebrity Deathmatch and Wildboyz which were shown with subtitles in Lithuanian. The network also aired local programmes as European Top 20, Baltic Top 20, Dance Floor Chart, MTV Oops and MTV Supermercado.
