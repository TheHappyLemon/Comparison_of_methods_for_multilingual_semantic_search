On 7 January 2016, it was announced that Schöpf moved to Schalke 04 and signed a contract until 2019. Despite suffering a cruciate knee injury, he impressed Schalke manager Domenico Tedesco enough to earn a contract extension to 2021, being praised by Tedesco as "Almost a complete player. He is very diligent and runs many, many kilometres in each game. He is versatile and always wants to play, no matter which position it is. In addition, he is technically savvy, is brave and a great person. We're delighted to be able to continue working with him."
