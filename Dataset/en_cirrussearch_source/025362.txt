Tim Wellens (born 10 May 1991) is a Belgian professional road cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam UAE Team Emirates. He is the son of former racing cyclist Leo Wellens and the nephew of cyclists Paul and Johan Wellens. Born in Sint-Truiden, Wellens has competed as a professional since the middle of the 2012 season, joining the Lotto–Belisol team after three seasons with the squad's development team. Wellens made his début with the team at the GP José Dubois, where he finished eighth; he later made his first appearances on the UCI World Tour, by competing in the Canadian pair of races in Quebec, and Montreal attempting to bridge to each race's breakaway during the respective events. Wellens performed strongly in the season-ending Tour of Beijing, finishing each of the race's stages inside the top 25 placings – taking a best of fifth on the final stage – en route to a final overall placing of tenth, and second to Saxo Bank–Tinkoff Bank rider Rafał Majka in the young rider classification. In August 2014, Wellens won Stage 6 in the Eneco Tour with a solo breakaway. The time he gained on this stage meant he ultimately won the race overall. He was named in the start list for the Tour de France. At the Eneco Tour, on Stage 6 Wellens attacked on the Côte Saint-Roch, then won nine seconds in the sprints in the golden kilometre. The main group was not able to chase Wellens down and his lead extended during the downhill run into Houffalize; he won the stage by 49 seconds ahead of Greg Van Avermaet, with Simon Geschke third. Wellens moved into the overall lead, 1' 03" ahead of Van Avermaet, with Wilco Kelderman dropping to third. Wellens defended his lead on the final stage to win his second successive Eneco Tour. At the Giro d'Italia, Wellens won Stage 6 after joining the successful breakaway partway through the stage. In July 2016, Wellens won Stage 5 of the Tour de Pologne with a solo breakaway in a rain soaked stage in which 85 riders abandoned. This gave him a lead of over 4 minutes in the general classification, which he successfully defended to the end of the race. Wellens abandoned Stage 15 of the Tour de France because of heat and pollen allergies which he refused to treat with a therapeutic use exemption (TUE), which he does not approve to use. Despite having asthma, Wellens does not use an inhaler and also criticised Chris Froome during his salbutamol case. Wellens' first victory in 2018 came at the Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana where he won the race for a second year in a row. At the Vuelta a Andalucía, Wellens won stage 4 and took the lead of the overall standings, by beating Mikel Landa on the cobbled climb of Alcalá de los Gazules. In October 2020, he was named in the startlist for the Vuelta a España. He won two stages during the race, and finished second to Guillaume Martin in the mountains classification. In February 2021, he won stage 3 of the Étoile de Bessèges and finished first in the general classification. 2008 1st National Junior XC MTB Championships 4th Overall Liège–La Gleize 2009 2nd Overall Tour d'Istrie 1st Stage 1 3rd Overall Tre Giorni Orobica 5th Road race, National Junior Road Championships 5th Overall Liège–La Gleize 1st Stage 4 2010 7th Overall Tour des Pays de Savoie 2011 5th Time trial, National Under-23 Road Championships 5th Overall Tour des Pays de Savoie 2012 2nd Overall Toscana-Terra di Ciclismo 2nd Overall Vuelta a Navarra 4th Circuit de Wallonie 8th Overall Circuit des Ardennes 1st Young rider classification 10th Overall Tour de l'Avenir 10th Overall Tour of Beijing 2013 8th Overall Tour de Wallonie 2014 (2 pro wins) 1st Overall Eneco Tour 1st Stage 6 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships 2nd Overall Ster ZLM Toer 4th Giro di Lombardia 6th GP Ouest–France 2015 (3) 1st Overall Eneco Tour 1st Stage 6 1st Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal 2nd Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 10th Overall Paris–Nice 10th Trofeo Andratx–Mirador d'es Colomer 2016 (4) 1st Overall Tour de Pologne 1st Mountains classification 1st Stage 5 Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 6 Held after Stages 7–9 1st Stage 7 Paris–Nice 2nd Road race, National Road Championships 10th Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 10th Amstel Gold Race 2017 (7) 1st Overall Tour of Guangxi 1st Stage 4 1st Grand Prix de Wallonie 1st Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 1st Trofeo Pollenca–Port de Andratx 1st Stage 5 Vuelta a Andalucía 2nd Overall BinckBank Tour 1st Stage 6 3rd Strade Bianche 4th Brabantse Pijl 5th Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec 9th Grote Prijs Jef Scherens 2018 (7) 1st Overall Tour de Wallonie 1st Stage 2 1st Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 1st Stage 4 1st Brabantse Pijl 1st Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 1st Stage 4 Giro d'Italia 3rd Overall BinckBank Tour 3rd Bretagne Classic 5th Overall Paris–Nice 1st Points classification 5th Giro di Lombardia 6th Amstel Gold Race 7th La Flèche Wallonne 7th Trofeo Lloseta–Andratx 2019 (5) 1st Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 2nd Trofeo Andratx–Lloseta 3rd Overall BinckBank Tour 1st Stage 4 3rd Overall Tour of Belgium 1st Stage 3 (ITT) 3rd Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 3rd Brabantse Pijl 4th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal 5th Trofeo Campos, Porreres, Felanitx, Ses Salines 8th Bretagne Classic 9th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 1st Points classification 1st Stages 1 & 3 (ITT) 9th Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec 10th Strade Bianche 10th Tre Valli Varesine Tour de France Held after Stages 3–17 Combativity award Stages 3 & 6 2020 (2) Vuelta a España 1st Stages 5 & 14 Held after Stages 5–6 4th Overall Tour de Luxembourg 5th Overall Volta ao Algarve 2021 (2) 1st Overall Étoile de Bessèges 1st Stage 3 4th Overall Benelux Tour 6th Overall Tour de Pologne 6th Grand Prix La Marseillaise 7th Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 2022 (2) 1st Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 2nd Overall Tour des Alpes-Maritimes et du Var 1st Stage 2 2nd Overall Tour of Belgium 2nd Clásica Jaén Paraíso Interior 4th Trofeo Calvià 8th Strade Bianche 8th Trofeo Pollença–Port d'Andratx 9th Brabantse Pijl 9th Japan Cup 2023 (2) 1st Overall Renewi Tour 1st Stage 3 Vuelta a Andalucía 3rd Clásica Jaén Paraíso Interior 5th Overall Tour of Guangxi 5th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 6th Vuelta a Murcia 2024 2nd Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 3rd Vuelta a Murcia 4th E3 Saxo Classic 4th Clásica Jaén Paraíso Interior "Lotto-Soudal".
