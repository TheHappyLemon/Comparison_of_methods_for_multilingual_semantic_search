Suresnes (French pronunciation: [syʁɛn] ) is a commune in the western suburbs of Paris, France. Located in Hauts-de-Seine, Île-de-France, 9.3 km (5.8 mi) from the centre of Paris, it had a population of 49,482 as of 2020. Suresnes borders the Bois de Boulogne in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. The neighbouring communes are Nanterre, Puteaux, Rueil-Malmaison and Saint-Cloud. Suresnes's landmarks include the Mémorial de la France combattante, where an annual ceremony is held on 18 June, as well as Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial nearby, below Fort Mont-Valérien, in addition to Foch Hospital in the town centre. The commune is served by Suresnes–Mont-Valérien station on the Transilien network and by two stops on Île-de-France tramway Line 2, all three giving access to the La Défense business district and its RER A, RER E and Paris Métro Line 1 services. Fort Mont-Valérien (along with its Mémorial de la France combattante) is situated in the commune, as is Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial. Suresnes has an elegant view of Paris and the Eiffel Tower, as does neighbouring Saint-Cloud. Robert Ormond Maugham, the father of W. Somerset Maugham, built a "country house" in Suresnes around 1883. The house, which still exists at 5 Rue Worth, was described by R.O. Maugham's grandson, Robin Maugham, as being, "very odd indeed – half Swiss chalet and half Japanese, with a projecting roof, stucco walls, and wooden supports for the little balconies." In 1974 the Spanish Socialist Workers Party held its 26th Congress in Suresnes (it was illegal in Spain under Franco). Felipe González was elected Secretary General, replacing Rodolfo Llopis Ferrándiz. González was from the "reform" wing of the party, and his victory signaled a defeat for the historic and veteran wing of the Party. The direction of the party shifted from the exiles to the young people in Spain who had not fought in the Spanish Civil War.
