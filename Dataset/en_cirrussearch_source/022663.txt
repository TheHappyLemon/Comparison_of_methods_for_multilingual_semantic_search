Look up 32, thirty-two, or XXXII in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 32 (thirty-two) is the natural number following 31 and preceding 33. 32 is the fifth power of two (25{\displaystyle 2^{5}}), making it the first non-unitary fifth-power of the form p5{\displaystyle p^{5}} where p{\displaystyle p} is prime. 32 is the totient summatory function Φ(n){\displaystyle \Phi (n)} over the first 10 integers, and the smallest number n{\displaystyle n} with exactly 7 solutions for φ(n){\displaystyle \varphi (n)}. The aliquot sum of a power of two is always one less than the number itself, therefore the aliquot sum of 32 is 31. 32=11+22+3332=(1×4)+(2×5)+(3×6)32=(1×2)+(1×2×3)+(1×2×3×4){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}32&=1^{1}+2^{2}+3^{3}\\32&=(1\times 4)+(2\times 5)+(3\times 6)\\32&=(1\times 2)+(1\times 2\times 3)+(1\times 2\times 3\times 4)\\\end{aligned}}} The product between neighbor numbers of 23, the dual permutation of the digits of 32 in decimal, is equal to the sum of the first 32 integers: 22×24=528{\displaystyle 22\times 24=528}. 32 is also a Leyland number expressible in the form xy+yx{\displaystyle x^{y}+y^{x}}, where: 32=24+42.{\displaystyle 32=2^{4}+4^{2}.} The eleventh Mersenne number is the first to have a prime exponent (11) that does not yield a Mersenne prime, equal to: 2047=322+(31×33)=1024+1023=211−1.{\displaystyle 2047=32^{2}+(31\times 33)=1024+1023=2^{11}-1.} The product of the five known Fermat primes is equal to the number of sides of the largest regular constructible polygon with a straightedge and compass that has an odd number of sides, with a total of sides numbering 232−1=3⋅5⋅17⋅257⋅65537=4294967295.{\displaystyle 2^{32}-1=3\cdot 5\cdot 17\cdot 257\cdot 65\;537=4\;294\;967\;295.} The first 32 rows of Pascal's triangle read as single binary numbers represent the 32 divisors that belong to this number, which is also the number of sides of all odd-sided constructible polygons with simple tools alone (if the monogon is also included). There are also a total of 32 uniform colorings to the 11 regular and semiregular tilings. There are 32 three-dimensional crystallographic point groups and 32 five-dimensional crystal families, and the maximum determinant in a 7 by 7 matrix of only zeroes and ones is 32. In sixteen dimensions, the sedenions generate a non-commutative loop SL{\displaystyle \mathbb {S} _{L}} of order 32, and in thirty-two dimensions, there are at least 1,160,000,000 even unimodular lattices (of determinants 1 or −1); which is a marked increase from the twenty-four such Niemeier lattices that exists in twenty-four dimensions, or the single E8{\displaystyle \mathrm {E} _{8}} lattice in eight dimensions (these lattices only exist for dimensions d∝8{\displaystyle d\propto 8}). Furthermore, the 32nd dimension is the first dimension that holds non-critical even unimodular lattices that do not interact with a Gaussian potential function of the form fα(r)=e−αr{\displaystyle f_{\alpha }(r)=e^{-\alpha {r}}} of root r{\displaystyle r} and α>0{\displaystyle \alpha >0}. 32 is the furthest point in the set of natural numbers N0{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} _{0}} where the ratio of primes (2, 3, 5, ..., 31) to non-primes (0, 1, 4, ..., 32) is 12.{\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}.} The atomic number of germanium The freezing point of water at standard atmospheric pressure in degrees Fahrenheit In the Standard Model of particle physics, there are 32 degrees of freedom among the leptons and all bosons that interact with them (including the graviton, which is generally expected to exist, and assuming there are no right-handed neutrinos)[citation needed] Messier 32, a magnitude 9.0 galaxy in the constellation Andromeda which is a companion to M31.

This is, in turn, derived from the 32 times of the Hebrew names for God, Elohim appears in the first chapter of Genesis. One of the central texts of the Pāli Canon in the Theravada Buddhist tradition, the Digha Nikaya, describes the appearance of the historical Buddha with a list of 32 physical characteristics. The Hindu scripture Mudgala Purana also describes Ganesha as taking 32 forms.

The FIFA Women's World Cup final tournament will feature 32 national teams starting with the next edition in 2023. The ball used in association football is most often made with 32 panels of leather or synthetic material. Thirty-two could also refer to: The number of teeth of a full set of teeth in an adult human, including wisdom teeth The size of a databus in bits: 32-bit The size, in bits, of certain integer data types, used in computer representations of numbers IPv4 uses 32-bit (4-byte) addresses ASCII and Unicode code point for space The code for international direct dial phone calls to Belgium In the title Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould, starring Colm Feore The Article 32 of the UCMJ concerns pre-trial investigations. Such a hearing is often called an "Article 32 hearing" The caliber .32 ACP The number of the French department Gers The traditional 32 counties of Ireland 32 is the ninth 10-happy number, while 23 is the sixth. Their sum is 55, which is the tenth triangular number, while their difference is 9=32.{\displaystyle 9=3^{2}.} On the other hand, a regular 32-sided icosidodecagon contains 23+32=17{\displaystyle 2^{3}+3^{2}=17} distinct symmetries. For comparison, a 16-sided hexadecagon contains 14 symmetries, an 8-sided octagon contains 11 symmetries, and a square contains 8 symmetries. Specifically, 31 is the eleventh prime number, equal to the sum of 20 and its composite index 11, where 33 is the twenty-first composite number, equal to the sum of 21 and its composite index 12 (which are palindromic numbers). 32 is the only number to lie between two adjacent numbers whose values can be directly evaluated from sums of associated prime and composite indices (32 is the twentieth composite number, which maps to 31 through its prime index of 11, and 33 by a factor of 11, that is the composite index of 20; the aliquot part of 32 is 31 as well). This is due to the fact that the ratio of composites to primes increases very rapidly, by the prime number theorem. 29 is the only earlier point, where there are twenty non primes, and ten primes. 40 — twice the composite index of 32 — lies between the 8th pair of sexy primes (37, 43), which represent the only two points in the set of natural numbers where the ratio of prime numbers to composite numbers (up to) is 1/2. Where 68 is the forty-eighth composite, 48 is the thirty second, with the difference 68 – 48 = 20, the composite index of 32. Otherwise, thirty-two lies midway between primes (23, 41), (17, 47) and (3, 61). At 33, there are 11 numbers that are prime and 22 that are not, when considering instead the set of natural numbers N+{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} ^{+}} that does not include 0. The product 11 × 33 = 363 represents the thirty-second number to return 0 for the Mertens function M(n). Sloane, N. J. A. (ed.). "Sequence A002088 (Sum of totient function)".
