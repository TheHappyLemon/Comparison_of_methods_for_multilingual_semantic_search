Sharing second place with 6½/9 at the Asian Continental Championships in April earned him a spot in the Chess World Cup 2011 and he secured a second Philippine Chess Championship. As So's playing strength and rating increased, so did the number of invites to high-level events. So initially led the strong Biel tournament before drifting back to share fifth place with 4½/9. Three weeks later, So held his own in the last NH "Experience vs Rising Stars" Match (played under Scheveningen match rules) scoring 4½/10 for the "Rising Stars" team.

In August 2012, So emigrated to the United States. In September 2012, So found success in first place at the Quebec International, scoring 7½/9, half a point ahead of Lazaro Bruzon and at the 40th Chess Olympiad drew against numerous top-level players including Levon Aronian, who described So as a "talented player from a country with a great chess culture". So came second in the Zonal 3.3 Championship in Tagaytay, Philippines earning a place in the Chess World Cup 2013 and shared first place with Pavel Eljanov and Bassem Amin at the Reykjavik Open. In doing so he breached the 2700 Elo mark, considered to be the level of an elite player and placed him 50th in the World.

This string of tournaments propelled So to 12th in the FIDE World Rankings. So expressed intent to represent the United States, filing the documents required for him to be able to change his FIDE nationality in 2013. He justified the move due to his family permanently settling in Canada, himself planning to study and permanently reside in the United States, and as part of a bid to boost his own career. He also said that National Chess Federation of the Philippines (NCFP) disapproved of his participation in the 2013 Summer Universiade in Kazan, Russia over the 2013 Asian Indoor Games and he felt obliged to participate in tournaments deemed important by the NCFP such as the Southeast Asian Games over concern that he might lose financial support even if it conflicted with his studies in the United States. Retrospectively in 2019 and in 2021, he said that he lacked the necessary "connections" for him to be able to thrive in the Philippines. According to Eugene Torre, aside from his family the move was likely caused by So not receiving recognition for his gold medal feat at the 2013 Universiade since his participation under the Federation of School Sports Association of the Philippines (FESSAP) led by Graham Lim was not sanctioned by the Philippine Olympic Committee. So's transfer to the United States Chess Federation was confirmed in the November 2014 rating list.

In August 2016, So finished clear first at the 2016 Sinquefield Cup, ahead of former World Champions Viswanathan Anand and Veselin Topalov, 2014 winner Fabiano Caruana, and 2015 winner Levon Aronian.
