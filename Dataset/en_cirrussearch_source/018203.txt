Ars-sur-Formans is a commune in the Ain department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of eastern France. The village is in the south-western part of the Ain department 33 km north of Lyon and 10 km east of Villefranche-sur-Saône in the heart of the Dombes region, which is known for its many lagoons. Ars-sur-Formans is on the Dombes Plateau, while to the west it borders the fertile hills of the Val de Saône. A small river, the Formans, runs from east to west across the commune just south of the village to join the Saône River near Saint-Bernard. The commune covers 5.50 km2 (2.12 sq mi). The D44 road from Savigneux west to Beauregard forms much of the northern border of the commune. Access to the village is by road D904 going west from Savigneux and continuing to join the D934 west of the commune. The road D888 also runs south-east of the village to Rancé. The name of the commune comes from arsa ("burnt"). Long known simply as Ars, the commune changed its name to Ars-sur-Formans by a decree dated 12 October 1956, published in the Official Journal on the 18th of the same month. The name Ars appeared as early as the year 969. In the 11th century, Ars was one of the many strongholds of the Lordship of Villars and his mansion was located next to the church. In 1226, Jean of Ars sold his land to the monastery of Île Barbe, but Villars retained sovereignty. In the 14th century, the protection of the castle was divided between the Lord of Villars and that of Beaujeu. The village was burned by the troops of Viry in 1409 and was obliged to submit to the consequences of the Wars of Religion throughout the following century. The parish of Ars belonged to the Principality of Dombes and the Châtellenie of Trévoux before being absorbed with all of the Dombes into the Kingdom of France in 1762. In 1790, Ars was made a commune of the Ain Department. It was part of the canton of Trévoux until 1984, when it was attached to the canton of Reyrieux. In 2015 it became part of the canton of Villars-les-Dombes. Since the mid-19th century, the name of Ars is associated with Jean-Marie Vianney, the former parish priest venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church. Well before his 1925 canonisation by Pope Pius XI, there were already many pilgrimages to the town. On 6 October 1986, Pope John Paul II travelled to Ars-sur-Formans as part of his third visit to France.

The Historial du Saint-Curé-d'Ars depicts the life story of the saint using 35 wax figures in 17 scenes, with period décor.

The Parish Church of Saint-Sixte (11th century) The Basilica of Ars, partly built in 1862 by the Lyon architect Pierre Bossan and his successor Sainte-Marie-Perrin, forms an extension to the old church. It enshrines the tomb of Saint Jean-Marie Vianney, who is honoured as the patron saint of all parish priests. The basilica hosts more than 500,000 visitors annually.
