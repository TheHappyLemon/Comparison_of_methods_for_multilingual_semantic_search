All Over the Place received generally positive reviews from critics. AnyDecentMusic stated the summary of other ratings and Metacritic did the same, but gave one positive review, three mixed reviews, and zero negative reviews. Writing for Clash, Robin Murray gave the album a 7 out of 10, explaining that it "follows hot on the heels of his controversial debut, and the project's breadth and diversity definitely lives up to its title" and "a record marked by diversity, 'All Over The Place' is held together by its makers ambitions". Dale Maplethorpe of Gigwise felt that it is sort of a hit and miss, praising its diversity, and stated that "KSI is brilliant at making 'summer bops'", citing the songs "Don't Play", "Really Love", and "Gang Gang" as examples. Kyann-Sian Williams of NME magazine gave the album 3 stars out of 5, stating that KSI "makes another honest attempt at a pop–rap". Kadish Morris from The Observer rated it 3 stars out of 5, providing fidgets from genre to genre, "UK garage to drill, pop to Afro swing, but never quite finds its resting place". Writing for The Independent, Annabel Nugent gave it a 3 out of 5, stating that "is a bumper-to-bumper blending of genres buoyed along by some of music's major-leaguers". Imogen Lawlor gave it a 3.5 out of 5 and stated that the album is "clearly structured as KSI effortlessly navigates numerous genres" and "given that he covers so many genres (with varying success), KSI's credentials as a 'hip hop sensation' are questionable". In the United Kingdom, All Over the Place debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, giving KSI his first chart-topper in the country, with first week sales of 34,328 album-equivalent units. 18,421 came from physical copies, with 5,227 of them being vinyl units. The album gathered 20.9 million streams, equating to an additional 13,389 units. It has been certified Gold by the BPI for surpassing 100,000 units in the country. Credits adapted from Tidal.
