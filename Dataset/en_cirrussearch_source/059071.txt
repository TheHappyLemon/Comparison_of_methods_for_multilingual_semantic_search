The 1989–90 European Cup was the 35th edition of Europe's premier club football tournament, the European Cup. The final was played at the Praterstadion in Vienna on 23 May 1990. The final was contested by Italian defending champions Milan and Portuguese two-time former winners Benfica. Milan successfully defended their title with a 1–0 victory, securing their fourth European Cup trophy. Milan remained the last team to successfully defend their trophy until Real Madrid did it again in 2017. Arsenal were denied a place in the competition, as this was the last year of a ban from European competitions for English clubs following the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985. 13 September 1989 Malmö Stadion, Malmö Attendance: 20,033 Referee: Claude Bouillet (France) 13 September 1989 Lerkendal Stadion, Trondheim Attendance: 10,352 Referee: Alan Snoddy (Northern Ireland) 13 September 1989 San Siro, Milan Attendance: 41,205 Referee: Stefanos Hatzistefanou (Cyprus) 13 September 1989 Ludwigsparkstadion, Saarbrücken Attendance: 5,900 Referee: Wim Egbertzen (Netherlands) 13 September 1989 Ibrox Park, Glasgow Attendance: 40,135 Referee: Pietro D'Elia (Italy) 13 September 1989 Ta' Qali, Attard Attendance: 1,268 Referee: Meletis Voutsaras (Greece) 13 September 1989 Stadionul Steaua, Bucharest Attendance: 8,236 Referee: Besnik Kaimi (Albania) 13 September 1989 Philips Stadion, Eindhoven Attendance: 16,100 Referee: John Spillane (Republic of Ireland) 13 September 1989 Stadion Letná, Prague Attendance: 15,944 Referee: Keith Cooper (Wales) Due to fan incidents at the match, Sparta Prague were punished with a stadium ban, being ordered to play their next European home match at least 300 kilometres (190 mi) from Prague. 13 September 1989 Stadion Śląski, Chorzów Attendance: 6,390 Referee: Ștefan Petrescu (Romania) 13 September 1989 Stade Vélodrome, Marseille Attendance: 18,686 Referee: Rosario Lo Bello (Italy) 13 September 1989 Dynamo-Stadion, Dresden Attendance: 33,014 Referee: Carlos Silva Valente (Portugal) 13 September 1989 Bozsik József Stadion, Budapest Attendance: 4,046 Referee: Piotr Werner (Poland) 13 September 1989 Brandywell Stadium, Derry Attendance: 10,317 Referee: Guy Goethals (Belgium) 13 September 1989 Racecourse Ground, Wrexham Attendance: 1,235 Referee: Frans Houben (Netherlands) 13 September 1989 Tivoli-Stadion, Innsbruck Attendance: 12,500 Referee: Rudolf Liska (Czechoslovakia) 27 September 1989 San Siro, Milan Attendance: 51,814 Referee: Siegfried Kirschen (East Germany) Malmö FF won 2–1 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 Achter de Kazerne, Mechelen Attendance: 6,000 Referee: Roger Philippi (Luxembourg) Mechelen won 5–0 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 Olympiastadion, Helsinki Attendance: 17,864 Referee: Valeri Butenko (Soviet Union) Milan won 5–0 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid Attendance: 16,000 Referee: Edgar Azzopardi (Malta) Real Madrid won 9–0 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 Olympiastadion, Munich Attendance: 43,000 Referee: Erik Fredriksson (Sweden) Bayern Münich won 3–1 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 Qemal Stafa Stadium, Tirana Attendance: 10,000 Referee: Coşkun Kutay (Turkey) 17 Nëntori won 5–1 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 Laugardalsvöllur, Reykjavík Attendance: 589 Referee: Rune Pedersen (Norway) Steaua București won 5–0 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 Stadion Allmend, Lucerne Attendance: 11,700 Referee: Joël Quiniou (France) PSV Eindhoven won 5–0 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 Fenerbahçe Stadium, Istanbul Attendance: 34,789 Referee: Tullio Lanese (Italy) Sparta Prague won 5–2 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 Narodna Armia, Sofia Attendance: 15,000 Referee: Jiří Stiegler (Czechoslovakia) CSKA Sofia won 6–2 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 Brøndby Stadion, Brøndbyvester Attendance: 10,300 Referee: Rodger Gifford (Wales) Marseille won 4–1 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 AEK Stadium, Athens Attendance: 28,151 Referee: Emilio Soriano Aladrén (Spain) AEK Athens won 5–4 on aggregate. 27 September 1989 Gradski Stadion, Novi Sad Attendance: 2,637 Referee: Alexey Spirin (Soviet Union) 2–2 on aggregate;
