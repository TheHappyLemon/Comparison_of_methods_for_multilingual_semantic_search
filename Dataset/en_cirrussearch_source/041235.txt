The 2018 Vuelta a España was a three-week Grand Tour cycling stage race that took place in Spain between 25 August and 16 September 2018. The race was the 73rd edition of the Vuelta a España and was the final Grand Tour of the 2018 cycling season. The race started in Málaga and finished in Madrid. The race was won by British rider Simon Yates from the team Mitchelton–Scott. The starting teams include: UCI WorldTeams AG2R La Mondiale Astana Bahrain–Merida BMC Racing Team Bora–Hansgrohe Team Dimension Data EF Education First–Drapac p/b Cannondale Team Katusha–Alpecin Lotto–Soudal LottoNL–Jumbo Mitchelton–Scott Movistar Team Quick-Step Floors Team Sky Team Sunweb Trek–Segafredo UAE Team Emirates Groupama–FDJ Professional Continental teams Burgos BH Caja Rural–Seguros RGA Cofidis Euskadi–Murias Four former winners started the race; Nairo Quintana, Alejandro Valverde (both from Movistar Team), Vincenzo Nibali (Bahrain–Merida) and Fabio Aru (UAE Team Emirates). The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were Richie Porte (BMC Racing Team), Simon Yates (Mitchelton–Scott), Miguel Ángel López (Astana), Michał Kwiatkowski (Team Sky), Wilco Kelderman (Team Sunweb), Steven Kruijswijk (LottoNL–Jumbo), Thibaut Pinot (Groupama–FDJ) and Rigoberto Urán (EF Education First–Drapac p/b Cannondale). The Vuelta a España had four individual classifications, for which jerseys were awarded daily to the leading rider, as well as a team competition. The primary classification was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the two individual time trials. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the leader of the general classification, and wears the red jersey. The leader of the general classification at the end of the race was considered the overall winner of the Vuelta a España. The second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey. The next classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, third-, second-, and first- and special-category. The leader wore a white jersey with blue polka dots. The final of the individual classifications was the combination classification. A rider's ranking in the combination classification was determined by tallying up his positions in the general, points, and mountains classifications. The leader wore a white jersey. If no rider was classified in all three classifications, riders classified in two would have been considered, and if that was tied the general classification will decide the winner. There was also the team classification. After each stage, the times of the three highest finishers of each team are added together. The victory was awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative time at the end of the event. In addition, there were two individual awards: the combativity award and the young rider award. The combativity award was given after each stage to the rider "who displayed the most generous effort and best sporting spirit." The daily winner wore a green number bib the following stage. At the end of the Vuelta, a jury decides the top three riders for the "Most Combative Rider of La Vuelta", with a public vote deciding the victor. The young rider award is calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1993. The leader wore a red number bib. A total of €1,120,000 will be awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification will receive €150,335, with the second and third placed riders getting €57,000 and €30,000 respectively. All finishers in the top 20 were awarded with money. The holders of the four individual classifications benefited on each stage they led. The final winners of the points and combined were given €11,000, while the mountains classification got €23,100 and the most combative rider got €3,000. The team classification winners were given €12,500. €11,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2–20. There was also a special award with a prize of €1,000, the Cima Alberto Fernández, given to first rider to reach the summit of the highest mountain of the race. In stage 2, Victor Campenaerts, who was third in the points and general classifications, wore the green jersey, because first-placed Rohan Dennis wore the red jersey as leader of the general classification; Michał Kwiatkowski, who was second in the general and points classifications, elected to wear his Polish national champion's jersey. Nelson Oliveira, who was fourth in the general and points classifications, wore the white with blue polka-dot jersey in stage 2, although no points were awarded during the opening individual time trial stage. Dylan van Baarle, who was fifth in the general and points classifications, therefore wore the white combination classification jersey. In stages 3 to 5, Alejandro Valverde, who was second in the points classification, wore the green jersey, because first-placed Michał Kwiatkowski wore the red jersey as leader of the general classification. As a result, the white jersey was worn by the third-placed rider in the combination classification; in stages 3 and 4, this was worn by Laurens De Plus, while Ben King wore the jersey on stage 5. In stage 7, Alejandro Valverde, who was second in the combination classification, wore the white jersey, because first-placed Michał Kwiatkowski wore the green jersey as leader of the points classification. In stages 8 and 9, Ben King, who was third in the combination classification, wore the white jersey, because first-placed Alejandro Valverde wore the green jersey as leader of the points classification; Michał Kwiatkowski, who was second in the combination classification, elected to wear his Polish national champion's jersey. King also wore the jersey on stages 10, and 12 to 14, having moved up to second in the combination classification after his stage 9 victory. In stages 15 and 17, Miguel Ángel López, who was third in the combination classification, wore the white jersey, because first-placed Alejandro Valverde wore the green jersey as leader of the points classification; Simon Yates, who was second in the combination classification, wore the red jersey as leader of the general classification. López also wore the jersey on stages 16, 18 and 19, having moved up to second in the combination classification behind Valverde. In stage 20, Miguel Ángel López, who was third in the combination classification, wore the white jersey, because first-placed Simon Yates wore the red jersey as leader of the general classification; Alejandro Valverde, who was second in the combination classification, wore the green jersey as leader of the points classification.
