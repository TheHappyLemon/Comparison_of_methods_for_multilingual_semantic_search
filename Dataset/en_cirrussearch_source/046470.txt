Cutlass is a 2007 American drama short film written and directed by Kate Hudson. It was filmed as part of Glamour magazine's Reel Moments series. Lacy (Dakota Fanning), a young songwriter, discovers a great but expensive guitar in a music shop. She's very excited by the guitar, and asks her mother, Robin (Virginia Madsen), to buy it. However, her mom says "absolutely not", but after that she reminiscences about the time back in 1979 when she got an Olds Cutlass as her first car. Her father used to say: "Whatever makes you happy, makes me happy". Maybe... in the end... she'll change her mind about Lacy's wish.
