This list of islands by area includes all islands in the world larger than 2,500 km2 (970 sq mi) and most of the islands over 1,000 km2 (390 sq mi), sorted in descending order by area. For size and location reference, four very large continental landmasses are also shown. Continental landmasses are not usually classified as islands despite being completely surrounded by water. However, because the definition of continent varies between geographers, the Americas are sometimes defined as two separate continents while mainland Australia is sometimes defined as an island as well as a continent. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this list, mainland Australia along with the other major landmasses have been listed as continental landmasses for comparison. The figures are approximations and are for the four major continental landmasses only. The artificial Panama and Suez canals are disregarded, as they are not natural waters that separate the continents. This section of the list might not be complete but covers almost all of the islands in the world over 1,000 km2 (390 sq mi). The area of some Antarctic islands is uncertain.

The United States-based scientific agency considers all landmasses surrounded by ocean water, including continental mainlands, as islands. Under their definition, Africa, Australia, Eurasia, North America, and South America are classified as continental mainland islands. Physiographically, there are only four continents (including offshore continental islands which sit on the nearby continental shelves) that are completely surrounded by water: Afro-Eurasia (57% of the global land area), the Americas (28.5%), Antarctica (9%), and Australia (5%). The remaining 0.5% is made up of remote oceanic islands, mostly scattered within Oceania in the central and south Pacific Ocean. Including landmasses which are above water and over 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi). The submerged continent of Zealandia (approx. 5,000,000 km2 (1,900,000 sq mi)) is excluded. Figure derived from the Global Islands Explorer website, by adding the areas of mainland Africa (29,370,907 km2 (11,340,171 sq mi)) and mainland Eurasia (50,439,819 km2 (19,474,923 sq mi)). Egypt has a small portion of its land located on mainland Eurasia. Equatorial Guinea's capital city is located on an island. Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey each have a small portion of their land located on continental Europe. Malaysia has a significant portion of its land located on an island. Russia has a big portion of its land located on continental Asia. Denmark's capital city is located on an island. 48 countries on mainland Africa and 78 countries on mainland Eurasia (38 countries on continental Asia and 40 countries on continental Europe). Abkhazia and South Ossetia are both located south of the Greater Caucasus watershed and thus geographically parts of Asia. Two states on mainland Africa and five states on mainland Eurasia (three states on continental Asia and two states on continental Europe). Figure derived from the Global Islands Explorer website, by adding the areas of mainland North America (20,090,075 km2 (7,756,821 sq mi)) and mainland South America (17,609,548 km2 (6,799,084 sq mi)). Depending on the definition, a significant portion of Panama (land east of the Panama Canal) could be considered a part of mainland South America. Ten countries on mainland North America and twelve countries on mainland South America. An overseas department and region of France, located on mainland South America. Antarctica is a special case, for if its ice is considered not as land, but as water, it is not a single landmass, but several landmasses of much smaller area, since the ice-bedrock boundary is below sea level in many regions of the continent. If its ice cover were to be lifted, some rocks that are currently below sea level would rise as the weight of the ice would be removed, although this would in part be counteracted, and in some areas of the continent overtaken, by eustatic rises in sea level. Area of mainland Antarctica, without the ice shelves and nearby islands. All territorial claims in Antarctica are in abeyance under the Antarctic Treaty System. 7 countries have made 7 territorial claims. Mainland Australia is more than three times the size of Greenland, the largest island. Australia is sometimes dubbed "The Island Continent" or "Earth's largest island, but its smallest continent". Figure derived from the Geoscience Australia website, the area of mainland Tasmania (64,519 km2 (24,911 sq mi)) has been deducted. The Global Islands Explorer website has given a slightly larger figure of 7,618,696 km2 (2,941,595 sq mi) for the area of mainland Australia. The largest island in the world. A part of the Kingdom of Denmark. The largest island in the Eastern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. The largest divided island in the world. The largest island in Asia. The only island shared by three UN member states. The largest island in Africa. The largest island in the Arctic Archipelago. The largest island in Europe. The largest island in the Caribbean. The largest volcanic island in the world. The largest uninhabited island in the world. The largest island in Antarctica. Antarctic territorial claims by Argentina (partial), Chile, and the United Kingdom. The largest island in South America. Antarctic territorial claims by Argentina (partial), Chile, and the United Kingdom. Located at the mouth of the Amazon River, Marajó is the world's largest fluvial island. Claimed by the People's Republic of China. The world's largest river island and the largest island surrounded entirely by fresh water. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus claims and controls one third of the island of Cyprus although this is not recognised by any country except Turkey. A dispute exists between the governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom concerning the sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. The disputed territory is described as "Falkland Islands (Malvinas)" by the United Nations. USGS – Global Islands Explorer Stephen Hawking; Lucy Hawking (9 January 2020). "Earth: What's It Made Of?".
