Nakuru is a city in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. It is the capital of Nakuru County, and is the third largest urban area in Kenya. As of 2019, Nakuru has an urban population of 570,674, making it the largest urban centre in the Rift Valley, succeeding Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County. The city lies along the Nairobi–Nakuru Highway, 160 kilometres (99 mi) from Nairobi. Archaeological discoveries were located about 8 kilometres (26,000 ft) from the Central Business District at Hyrax Hill. The city was incepted on 28 January 1904 when a local area one mile away from the railway station's main entrance was proclaimed to be a township.[by whom?] The name of the town was derived from the Maasai-speaking people of Kenya. During the colonial era, the British established Nakuru as part of the White Highlands and it became a municipality in 1952. After the founding of the Republic of Kenya, the first and second presidents of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel Arap Moi respectively, had their semi-official residences. The city had been known for Kenyan politics and was home to politicians such as Kariuki Chotara, Kihika Kimani, Mirugi Kariuki, and Koigi Wamwere. During the 2007 post-election violence, dozens of buildings in Nakuru were burnt to the ground. On 3 June 2021, Nakuru was no longer a municipality after the Kenyan Senate voted that its status was adequate enough to be a city. Following the Senate of Kenya's approval in June, the President of the Republic of Kenya chartered Nakuru on 1 December 2021. It is the fourth urban centre in Kenya to be declared a city after Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu. The city of Nakuru is situated in Nakuru County, Kenya. It lies 1,850 metres above sea level.
