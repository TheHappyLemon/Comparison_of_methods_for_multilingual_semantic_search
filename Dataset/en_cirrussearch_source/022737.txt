Daugavpils Satiksme (English: Daugavpils Transport) is the public transport corporation which operates tram and bus systems in the eastern Latvian city of Daugavpils. Two municipal public transport companies existed before 1 January 2014; A/S "Tramvaju uzņēmums" (Tramway Enterprise JSC) and SIA "Daugavpils autobusu parks". The bus network currently comprises 33 routes. In 2021 the purchase of 35 compressed natural gas powered buses was approved, to be supported by the Cohesion Fund. In 2022 the fleet consisted of 28 Solaris, 16 Volvo, 5 Iveco and 11 Mercedes-Benz vehicles. The tram network was opened on 5 November 1946 and a second line was opened in 1950 and extended in 1951 and 1958. Further extensions followed in 1965, 1990, 2020 and 2023. It comprises approximately 25 kilometres of track and five lines, the fourth opening within existing infrastructure in January 2022 and the fifth in January 2023. The network uses Russian broad-gauge trackage of 1,524 mm (5 ft); along with the tram network of Riga these are the only two utilizing such a gauge inside the European Union. An uncommon characteristic is the use of trolley poles for current collection, although these are being phased out from the late 2010s. Green track is extensively used throughout and the northern sections pass through woodland areas. Tramcars are stored outside at a depot on Butļerova Street. In 2020 a realignment servicing the Daugavpils Regional Hospital opened. This project saw the introduction of the first pantograph equipped cars. In February 2016 the Ministry of Transport announced plans for the construction of a new tram line. Preliminary plans call for a connection between the Jaunforštadte area in the north of the city and the centre of the network, in the vicinity of Daugavpils Station. The route is projected to increase the number of tram passengers to around 500 000 per year. The project was cancelled in 2022. In September 2020, the Municipal Council of Daugavpils considered an allocation of 24,000 euros for the subsequent implementation of the project for the construction of a new tramline, which supposedly will connect the “Jaunstropi” district with the “Ķimiķu ciemats” district. Czech Pragoimex trams will be assembled locally at the Daugavpils Locomotive Repair Plant (DLRR) as part of the project which will for the first time connect two separate lines.
