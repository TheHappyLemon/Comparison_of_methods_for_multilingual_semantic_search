Nitrogen oxide may refer to a binary compound of oxygen and nitrogen, or a mixture of such compounds: Nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen(II) oxide, or nitrogen monoxide Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen(IV) oxide Nitrogen trioxide (NO3), or nitrate radical Nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen(0,II) oxide Dinitrogen dioxide (N2O2), nitrogen(II) oxide dimer Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), nitrogen(II,IV) oxide Dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), nitrogen(IV) oxide dimer Dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), nitrogen(V) oxide, or nitronium nitrate [NO2]+[NO3]− Nitrosyl azide (N4O), nitrogen(−I,0,I,II) oxide Nitryl azide (N4O2) Oxatetrazole (N4O) Trinitramide (N(NO2)3 or N4O6), nitrogen(0,IV) oxide Nitrosonium (N≡O+ or [NO]+) Nitronium (O=N+=O or [NO2]+) In atmospheric chemistry: NOx (or NOx) refers to the sum of NO and NO2. NOy (or NOy) refers to the sum of NOx and all oxidized atmospheric odd-nitrogen species (e.g. the sum of NOx, HNO3, HNO2, etc.) NOz (or NOz) = NOy − NOx Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen ("MON"): solutions of nitric oxide in dinitrogen tetroxide/nitrogen dioxide. Nitric oxide, NO Nitrogen dioxide, NO2 Nitrous oxide, N2O Dinitrogen trioxide, N2O3 Dinitrogen tetroxide, N2O4 Dinitrogen pentoxide, N2O5 Trinitramide, N4O6 Due to relatively weak N–O bonding, all nitrogen oxides are unstable with respect to N2 and O2, which is the principle behind the catalytic converter, and prevents the oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere from combusting.
