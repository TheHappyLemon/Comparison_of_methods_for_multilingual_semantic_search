The Audi A3 is a subcompact executive/small family car (C-segment) manufactured and marketed by the German automaker Audi AG since September 1996, currently in its fourth generation. The first two generations of the Audi A3 were based on the Volkswagen Group A platform, while the third and fourth generations use the Volkswagen Group MQB platform. The original A3 (or Type 8L) was announced back in June 1995, but introduced first in the European market for more than year in September 1996, marking Audi's return to the production of smaller cars following the demise of the Audi 50 in 1978. This was the first Volkswagen Group model to use the "PQ34" or "A4" platform, bearing a close resemblance to the contemporary Volkswagen Golf Mk4, which arrived a year later. Within three years, this platform was used for total of seven cars. The A3 was initially available only with a three-door hatchback body, to present a more sporty image than the Golf, in both front and four-wheel drive. The inline four-cylinder engines were transversely mounted. The Audi A3 was the eighth model in the Audi lineup to use five valves per cylinder. The dashboard was also used by the first generation SEAT León and second generation SEAT Toledo. The United Kingdom market first received the Audi A3 in November 1996. In 1999 Audi expanded the range with the introduction of more powerful versions: a 1.8 turbo rated 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp), and a 1.9 TDI diesel engine with unit injector "Pumpe Düse" (PD) technology and variable geometry turbocharger. The four-wheel-drive A3 1.8T quattro used either the 150 PS (110 kW; 148 hp) or 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp) engine, and the same Haldex Traction-based four-wheel-drive system as the Audi S3 and the Audi TT. Also in 1999, Audi also introduced a five-door body. In late 2000 the A3 range was revised with new headlights and rear lamps, other minor cosmetic changes, an improved interior, and the introduction of a six-speed manual gearbox, on the 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp) 1.8 Turbo and the new 130 PS (96 kW; 128 hp) 1.9 TDI. Audi's electronic stability control, traction-control, and brake force distribution computer became standard equipment in some countries. Although the first-generation Audi A3 was replaced in Europe in 2003, the first generation model continued to be sold in some markets. Production of the first generation model stopped in Brazil in 2006. Audi A3 3-door (pre-facelift) Audi A3 3-door (pre-facelift) Audi A3 5-door (pre-facelift) Audi A3 5-door (post-facelift) Interior The SEAT León Mk1 shares the dashboard with the A3 Euro NCAP rating of 4 out of 5 stars. Their evaluation concluded "the column lock, adjuster lever and bracket presented hazards in the knee impact area for the driver. These could cause high loads on his upper legs and damage to his knees." The A3 also provides almost no protection to pedestrians, giving it two stars out of a possible four. Audi released the A3-derived Audi S3 in 1999, only as a three-door hatchback. The inline-four 20v 1.8 L turbocharged petrol engine came in two versions: 210 PS (154 kW; 207 hp) and 225 PS (165 kW; 222 hp). Early models (1999–2001) had 210 PS (154 kW; 207 hp). Later models (2001–2003) had variable valve timing and 225 PS (165 kW; 222 hp). The engine had a maximum of 280 N⋅m (210 ft⋅lbf) torque. This was the first time a small four-cylinder engine had been used in an Audi S-series car. Although dubbed "quattro", the S3 uses a different four-wheel drive system. The Haldex Traction coupling adjusts the bias of torque distribution from the front to rear axle as grip requirements change – most of the time it operates as a front-wheel drive. The S3 was sold in Europe, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The S3 was given a facelift in 2002, where it was given one-piece headlights/indicator units, different front wings, rear lights clusters, and some minor upgrades to interior trim. Standard features include xenon HID headlamps with high pressure washers and auto levelers, front fog lamps, 17" "Avus" alloy wheels with 225/45R17 tyres, electrically adjustable Recaro leather seats, climate control, alarm and electronic stability control with traction control. Options include a Bose sound system, boot/trunk or in-dash mounted 6-disc CD changer, metallic paint, 18-inch 9-spoke RSTT wheels, glass sunroof, centre arm rest, privacy glass (B-pillar backwards), auto-dimming rear-view mirror, parking assist, luggage net, heated front seats, cruise control, aluminium door mirror casings and part leather/Alcantara (blue/silver/yellow) combination seat coverings. These items are standard in some export markets. The engines used are the same as those for many other cars in the Volkswagen Group. At the 2003 Geneva Motor Show, Audi launched the second generation of the A3, the Typ 8P, designed by Gary Telaak during 2000 (however, the final design was frozen in 2001). Originally launched only as a three-door hatchback with four-cylinder engines, it featured a new automobile platform (the PQ35 platform), a redesigned and more spacious interior, new petrol engines with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), and standard six-speed manual gearboxes (except on the base 1.6 petrol and 1.9 diesel). In mid-2003 the line was updated with two sports-oriented models, a 2.0 Turbo-FSI version rated 200 PS (147 kW; 197 hp), and a 3.2 L VR6 engine (for the first time) with 250 PS (184 kW; 247 hp). Haldex Traction-based quattro on-demand four-wheel drive, and the S-Tronic semi-auto gearbox were introduced as options (quattro is standard on the VR6) on models with engines over 140 PS (103 kW; 138 hp). In 2005 the "S line" trim level, offering new decorative elements, became available and the three-door A3 received the same front-end styling features as the Sportback model. For the first time, the A3 became available in the North American market, exclusively with the Sportback body, with the base 2.0 inline-four FSI introduced in 2005 as a 2006 model, and the 3.2 VR6 Quattro following. The five-door "Sportback" model was introduced in June 2004. The A3 Sportback is 80 mm (3.1 in) longer than the base three-door body, and includes improved rear cabin space and a larger luggage compartment (370 litres). It also received the new "single frame" front grille originally introduced in the A8 W12, which was later adopted across the whole A3 range. In August 2006, Audi introduced the second generation S3. Offered in three- and five-door body styles, the second generation—Typ 8P—S3 is powered by a modified and uprated Volkswagen Group-sourced 2.0-litre turbocharged FSI petrol engine, with a maximum output of 195 kW (265 PS; 261 bhp). As with all Audi S models, the design was done in-house by quattro GmbH. The engine features uprated high-performance pistons, revised boost/fuel mapping, increased turbocharger size (KKK K04) and larger intercooler. The most powerful form of this engine, and quattro four-wheel drive, makes for a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 5.7 seconds, and an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). Audi offers both six-speed manual and six-speed S-Tronic automatic transmissions with the S3. The spring ratings and dampers were revised, along with the body kit. Like its predecessor, although badged a "Quattro" model, the S3 does not employ a Torsen centre differential (as in other common Quattro models), but instead uses the Swedish Haldex Traction system in its on-demand four-wheel drive transmission, due to the transverse engine layout. Euro NCAP tested a second-generation Audi A3 with front airbags, side airbags, seatbelt pretensioners, and load limiters as standard. Despite Audi increasing the protection inside the car for the driver and passengers, pedestrian safety actually got 33% worse compared to the first generation and Euro NCAP gave criticism for the car offering virtually no protection at all on the front end and scoring just one star from a possible four. "A poor result for a new car" was the verdict given for pedestrian safety after the test. 2003–2005 Audi A3 3-door 2005–2008 Audi A3 3-door 2005–2008 Audi A3 3-door 2005–2008 Audi A3 Sportback Interior (Sportback) Audi introduced a number of changes to the A3 and S3 in 2008. These include revised nose and tail styling, with a modified grille and daytime running lights, common rail 2.0 TDI engines, seven-speed S tronic dual clutch transmission availability for the smaller non-U.S. engines, and optional "magnetic ride" adaptive shock absorbers. In addition, the range now includes an S3 Sportback model. Also, a cabriolet version was introduced. It was similar in dimensions to the 3-door version, with a two-box design. 2008–2010 Audi A3 Sportback 2008–2010 Audi A3 Sportback 2008–2010 Audi A3 3-door 2008–2010 Audi A3 cabriolet 2010–2013 Audi A3 Sportback 2010–2013 Audi A3 Sportback 2010-2012 Audi A3 cabriolet 2010 Audi S3 Sportback 2010 Audi S3 Sportback Interior Audi A3 TDI Clubsport quattro is a concept car unveiled in 2008. Based on the Audi A3 three-door, it is an approach by Audi to address both performance and the environment. The engine in the concept car is a turbocharged 2.0-litre diesel producing 224 hp (167 kW) and 332 lb⋅ft (450 N⋅m). of torque. It produces 113.8 horsepower (84.9 kW) per litre while meeting Euro 5 Diesel emission standards. It uses the quattro drive system with a six-speed manual transmission. The chassis has Audi's Magnetic Ride Suspension system, lowering the vehicle 1.4 inches (36 mm) from the base model. It also has ceramic front brakes, a four-link rear suspension and electro-mechanical servo assist for the rack and pinion steering. Exterior modifications include the widening of the three-door's grill, modifying the odd, and enlarging air intakes. Bolt-on fender flares and a large rear spoiler have been added. The interior changes include sport seats and a flat-bottomed steering wheel. Audi claims performance of 0 to 62 mph (0 to 100 km/h) in 6.6 seconds with a top speed of 149 mph (240 km/h). It is expected to get approximately 40 miles per US gallon (5.9 L/100 km; 48 mpg‑imp). The Audi RS 3 is derivative of the A3 Sportback with a 5-cylinder, 2,480 cc (151 cu in) turbocharged engine rated at 340 PS (250 kW; 335 hp) and 450 N⋅m (332 lb⋅ft), vermicular-graphite cast iron crankcase, seven-speed S tronic transmission with two automatic modes and one manual mode, Quattro on-demand four-wheel drive system, widened track to 1,564 mm (61.57 in), MacPherson strut in aluminum, lowered body by 25 mm (0.98 in), 19-inch cast aluminum wheels in machine-polished titanium styling (optional black with a red rim flange) with 235/35 front and 225/35 rear tires, 370 mm (14.57 in) front and 310 mm (12.20 in) ventilated brake discs, aluminum brake disk covers, four-piston fixed calipers in high-gloss black with RS logos, electronic stabilization program with Sport mode, flared front fenders made of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP), prominent sill panels and exterior-mirror casings in matte aluminum, roof spoiler, high-gloss black diffuser insert, two elliptical exhaust tailpipes on the left, black interior, sports seats upholstered in Nappa leather with silver contrasting stitching, inlays in Piano black finish or Aluminum Race colour, flat-bottomed leather multifunction sports steering wheel, choice of 5 body colors are available with an unlimited selection of custom paint finishes. Its acceleration is quoted as 0 to 62 mph (0 to 100 km/h) in 4.6 seconds, with an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h). Optional features included front bucket seats, roof rails in matte aluminum look, styling packages in black or matte aluminum. First deliveries started in early 2011. The A3 Cabriolet Sport Final Edition is a version of the A3 Cabriolet Sport model for the UK market, commemorating the end of the A3 Cabriolet's production run. It included Vienna leather upholstery, front seat heating, rear parking sensors, automatic headlight and wiper activation, cruise control, a Bluetooth mobile phone interface. S line Final Edition is based on the A3 Cabriolet Sport Final Edition model, with 18-inch S line alloy wheel with a new five-segment spoke design, full Vienna leather upholstery, S line safety and entertainment features with xenon plus headlights with LED daytime running lamps, DVD-based satellite-navigation, Audi Music Interface iPod connection, a BOSE sound system. In January 2007, the naturally-aspirated 2.0 FSI was replaced by a new turbocharged 1.8 TFSI engine rated 160 PS (118 kW; 158 hp). It is available in front-wheel drive only. In late 2007, Audi introduced a new 125 PS (92 kW; 123 hp) 1.4 L TFSI engine for the A3, replacing the 1.6 L FSI engine, and a new diesel "e"-model. The "e"-model, Audi's equivalent of Volkswagen's BlueMotion, is available with the 1.9 L TDI engine, and offers a more ecological car, with a CO2 emission below 120 g/km. Audi released two models of the A3 1.6 TDI for the European market. The first uses Audi's start/stop and energy recovery system, and produces 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp). This engine achieves approximately 4.1 L/100 km (69 mpg‑imp; 57 mpg‑US).[clarification needed] The second engine does not use the same efficiency systems and will produce 90 PS (66 kW; 89 hp) will get 4.5 L/100 km (63 mpg‑imp; 52 mpg‑US). They went on sale in June 2009. In 2009, the 1.6 L eight-valve petrol engine was replaced by a turbocharged 1.2 TFSI engine already found in VW's Polo and Golf models. This engine is rated at 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) and 175 N⋅m (129 lb⋅ft), emitting 127 g/km of CO2. The A3 2.0 TDI clean diesel is a version of Audi's A3 2.0 TDI for the North American market, making it the second Audi TDI vehicle sold in North America, following the Audi Q7 TDI in 2008. It is a FWD vehicle with S-Tronic transmission with Hill-hold assist, Sirius satellite radio, Leather seats and steering wheel, Auxiliary audio input, Dual-zone climate control, 17-inch (430 mm) alloy wheels. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 North American International Auto Show. This US model would begin sale in the first quarter of 2010 as a 2010 model year vehicle. In March 2011, the line-up was expanded with the introduction of a more powerful 2.0 TDI with 170 PS (125 kW; 168 hp). The 2.0 TDI engine was included in the engines found by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to use software intentionally designed to turn off emission control systems except when undergoing emission testing. Models made from 2009 to 2015 were affected. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show and went on sale in Europe in September 2012. First vehicle using the flexible modular Volkswagen Group MQB platform, the third generation is available as a three-door hatchback, a five-door "Sportback", a four-door saloon to directly rival the Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class, and a two-door Cabriolet. The front suspension is a MacPherson strut set-up while the rear utilizes torsion bar suspension (models with less than 150 PS) or multi-link rear suspension (models with 150 PS or more). The features include: Multi-collision brake: Emergency braking function stops the car after the first impact, to prevent secondary collisions Multi Media Interface MMI entertainment system (Tegra 3 processor) with handwriting recognition 4G broadband internet Adaptive cruise control Pre sense front/basic radar-guided collision avoidance system Active lane assist Side assist Early German models include 1.4 TFSI (122 PS), 1.8 TFSI (180 PS), and 2.0 TDI (150 PS).[failed verification] 1.2 TFSI (105 PS), 1.4 TFSI (140 PS), 1.8 TFSI quattro (180 PS), 1.6 TDI (105 PS), and 2.0 TDI quattro (150 PS) were added in 2013.[failed verification] A3 1.2 TFSI (105 PS) was added to the UK market in 2013, followed by A3 1.4 TFSI (140 PS) in 2013. For the 2020 model year, the vehicle is exclusively built at the Ingolstadt plant, as opposed to previous model years where sedans and convertibles were built at the Győr plant. The A3 Sedan includes a body 11 mm (0.43 in) wider and 9 mm (0.35 in) lower than that of the A3 Sportback. Other features include 16- to 18-inch-wheels (optional 19-inch wheels via quattro GmbH) and electronic stabilization control with electronic differential lock. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2013 New York Auto Show. The German model went on sale in late summer 2013. Early models include 1.4 TFSI (140 PS), 1.8 TFSI (180 PS), and 2.0 TDI (150 PS). Delivery of the UK models began in autumn of 2013. Early models include 1.4 TFSI (140 PS), 1.8 TFSI (180 PS), and 2.0 TDI (150 PS). In international markets like Pakistan, Audi has introduced it with a 1.2 TFSI engine. This has allowed Audi to bypass high import duties on larger displacement engines, offer the car at a competitive price, and become a leader in the imported luxury car segment. In Malaysia, the Audi A3 was launched in 2014 and sold as two models - a 1.4-liter with 7-speed S-Tronic automatic transmission, and a 1.8-liter with 6-speed DSG and Quattro all-wheel drive. The facelifted version has yet to be launched. In Singapore, the Audi A3 sedan and Sportback are currently available as 1.0-liter turbo models only. The A3 cabriolet model was offered starting in 2014. It has a three-box body style and a larger boot than the previous model (320 litres versus 260). The Audi A3 Sportback includes a wheelbase 58 mm (2.28 in) over previous model, 35 mm (1.38 in) longer than that of the A3 and a front axle shifted forward by 40 mm (1.57 in) over the previous model. Other features include a choice of 13 body colours (three solid finishes, eight metallic finishes, and two pearl-effect finishes), an optional high-gloss package adding accents around the windows (standard with the Ambiente trim line), six-speed manual transmission (optional S-Tronic) for all engine models, 16 or 17-inch wheels depending on trim line (optional 18-inch wheels), Audi drive select (standard with Ambition) with optional S-Tronic, and optional electromagnetic damper control system. German models went on sale in February 2013. Early models include 1.4 TFSI (122 PS), 1.8 TFSI (180 PS), 1.8 TFSI quattro (180 PS), and 1.6 TDI. 1.2 TFSI (105 PS), 1.4 TFSI (140 PS), 2.0 TDI (150 PS), 2.0 TDI quattro (150 PS), and 2.0 TDI (184 PS) were available in later date. It is a version of the A3 Sportback with 1.4 TFSI (110 PS) engine powered by compressed natural gas or Audi e-gas synthetic methane; gas tank made of gas-impermeable polyamide polymer, carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), glass fiber reinforced polymer; and an electronic gas pressure regulator. The synthetic methane was produced by waste product from a nearby Werlte biogas plant operated by power utility EWE. The plug-in hybrid concept car was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. In May 2013 Audi confirmed its decision to produce a plug-in hybrid version of the A3, the Audi A3 Sportback e-tron, which was scheduled for retail sales in Europe by late 2013, and by mid 2014 in the U.S. and the UK. The A3 e-tron shares the same plug-in hybrid powertrain used in both the Volkswagen Golf GTE and Passat GTE. To charge the A3 e-tron, the Audi four rings logo is pulled along to reveal a charging socket. The A3 Sportback e-tron is powered by a 1.4 L TSI gasoline engine that delivers 148 bhp (110 kW) and 184 lb⋅ft (249 N⋅m) of torque, coupled with a 101 bhp (75 kW) electric motor, which is integrated into the car's six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, for a total combined output of 201 bhp (150 kW) and 243 lb⋅ft (329 N⋅m). The plug-in hybrid has an 8.8 kWh battery pack that delivers an all-electric range of 50 km (31 mi) on the NEDC, and a total of 940 km (584 mi). The plug-in hybrid can reach a top speed of 220 km/h (137 mph) and can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 7.6 seconds. According to Audi the car has an average fuel efficiency of 188 mpg equivalent and CO2 emissions of 35 g/km. After some delays, the A3 Sportback e-Tron went on sale across Europe in August 2014. The first 227 units were registered in Germany in August 2014. As of December 2015[update], global sales totaled 12,994 units, of which, 12,945 units were registered in Europe, and 49 units in the United States, where deliveries began in December 2015. Audi discontinued the A3 PHEV Sportback e-tron in Europe in November 2018. However, the model was briefly re-introduced at the end of 2019 for MY20, now called A3 Sportback 40 e-tron under Audi's new naming scheme. The revised A3 e-tron in the UK featured a different level of specification, losing the previously standard LED headlights but gaining Audi's virtual cockpit as standard. The revised model featured the same battery and drivetrain as before, now rated at 22 miles of electric range under the new WLTP test. The third generation Audi S3 is powered by a 2.0 L; 121.1 cu in (1,984 cc) TFSI (turbo gasoline direct injection) inline-four engine, with an output of 221 kW (300 PS; 296 bhp) at 5,500 rpm and 380 N⋅m (280 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 1,800-5,500 rpm, with its redline at 6,800 rpm. It features new pistons with stronger bolts and new rings, as well as reinforced connecting rods with new mounts transferring the power to the crankshaft. The cylinder head is made of a new lightweight aluminium alloy designed with high strength and temperature resistance in mind. It has a combined fuel economy of 23 mpg‑US (10 L/100 km; 28 mpg‑imp) manual; and 24 mpg‑US (9.8 L/100 km; 29 mpg‑imp) with S tronic. The engine weighs in at 148 kg (326 lb), 5 kg (11 lb) lighter than the previous generation. The S3 is capable of 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.8-5.2 seconds and has an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h). Details for the RS 3 Sportback were revealed in December 2014. It went on sale in the first quarter of 2015 and featured a 2.5 litres (2,480 cc) straight-5 engine with 367 PS (270 kW; 362 hp) and 465 N⋅m (343 lbf⋅ft) of torque. The RS 3 Sportback is equipped with 7-speed dual clutch S tronic transmission and quattro all-wheel drive system. Scott Keogh of Audi of America said in April 2015 that he's "confident" we'll see the car come to the United States. In 2017, the RS3 sedan or saloon was added to the line-up. The RS3 can be ordered with a fixed-suspension or an adjustable magnetic damper. Depending on the country, the RS3 can be purchased with different optional packages. For example, the Black Optic package includes high-gloss black 19-inch wheels, high-gloss black outside mirror covers, and a high-gloss black trunk lip spoiler, while the Dynamic package consists of titanium 19-inch wheels with summer performance tires, red brake calipers, and a sport exhaust system. After four years, the third-generation Audi A3 was given a facelift for the model year 2016, which also coincided with the 20th anniversary of the A3 name. The facelifted model was first unveiled through a set of official images in April 2016. The new A3 sedan was given significant cosmetic updates, which were inline with the automaker's new design philosophy. As a result, the 2017 Audi A3 featured the Matrix LED headlamps that were earlier seen in the A8 flagship sedan and the R8 supercar. The front grille was also given a refreshed treatment that made the A3 look like the A4. Changes on the sides and rear were minimal, with only the taillights getting optional LEDs. There were multiple updates on the interior as well, with a fully digital 12.3-inch instrument cluster screen placed behind a revised steering wheel available as an optional upgrade. Sold in Europe and released in the United States for the 2016 model year. Euro NCAP tested a third-generation Audi A3, 3-door hatchback with front airbags, side airbags, seatbelt pretensioners and load limiters as standard and scored it accordingly: with cylinder on demand S tronic 2017–present S tronic 2017–present S tronic 2019–present The new A3 was unveiled online in 2020. The new interior and exterior styling is heavily inspired by Lamborghini, LED headlights and taillights, with the option of Matrix and Laser LED headlights.[citation needed] It shares the MQB evo platform with other Audi models, and with the Volkswagen Golf Mk8, SEAT Leon Mk4, and Škoda Octavia Mk4. It is 3 centimetres longer and wider when compared to the outgoing model while keeping the wheelbase length the same, trunk cargo space is 380 litres with the seats up, and 1200 litres with the seats folded down. It has a drag coefficient of 0.28, and is powered by 1.0-liter 3-cylinder gasoline turbocharged engine with 110 hp, 1.5-litre with 150 hp, 2.0-liter TDI with 116 hp or 150 hp. There is also a new 2.0-liter Quattro version in both gasoline and diesel variants. It produces 190 hp (142 kW) and 320 N⋅m (236 lbf⋅ft) of torque (400 Nm for the diesel variant). It also has reduced cargo space (320 litres instead of the 380 litres in the other A3 variants) due to the Quattro four-wheel-drive system. The S3 model has the same 2.0L petrol engine from the previous generation, producing 310 hp (231 kW) and 400 N⋅m (295 lbf⋅ft) of torque, but this time is only available with an automatic gearbox. Similarly it has reduced cargo space due to the Quattro four-wheel-drive system. Like the previous generation, the new S3 also comes as a saloon/sedan. The new A3 Sedan was revealed on 21 April 2020, with the front fascia similar to that of the A3 Sportback. Compared with its predecessor, the new A3 Sedan is 4 cm longer (4.50 meters), 2 cm wider (1.82 meters), and 1 cm taller (1.43 meters). However, the wheelbase remains unchanged. This generation of the A3 sedan is not expected to arrive in North America until late 2021, as a 2022 model. North America will not get the Sportback e-Tron like before. In the countries that will receive The PHEV A3 will no longer be called The e-tron because this name is reserved for electric Audi cars. Instead, it is called The TFSIe. There are 2 version of the TFSIe, called the "40" and the "45". The former dispatches a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of 7.8 sec, while the latter is based on the Golf GTE and is a second quicker to 60 mph (97 km/h). This generation of the A3 sportback is arriving in Thailand this November 2021, as a 2022 model. The highest specification RS 3 model is fitted with a 2.5-litre 5-cylinder producing 400 PS (294 kW; 395 hp) and 500 N⋅m (369 lb⋅ft), and has 0-60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of 3.8 seconds. It gets a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, or an electric S-Tronic gearbox. It also gets the new MMI infotainment system, with a 10.25 or 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and a secondary screen of 10.1-inches. With the RS DynamiC package the speed limiter is removed, allowing the RS3 TO reach a top speed of 290 km/h (180 mph). The US-market RS3 produces marginally more power than the European RS3, at a claimed 401 hp (299 kW; 407 PS). This is partially due to the lack of a Gasoline particulate filter for US model cars, as it is not required to meet emissions standards. The US-market RS3 instead receives a secondary catalytic converter. In October 2022, the RS3 Performance Edition was introduced for European buyers. The boost was increased from 1.5 to 1.6 bar (21.8 to 23.2 psi), bringing power up to 407 PS (299 kW; 401 hp) and thus matching the peak power of the federalized version. Torque remained as before but across a slightly wider range. The (unlimited) top speed reaches 300 km/h (186 mph), a first for an A3 based model. Production is limited to 300 examples.
