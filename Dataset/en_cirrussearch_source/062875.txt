In 1953, a small group of Inuit families were resettled on the Lindstrom Peninsula, and others to Craig Harbour, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police trading post 72 km (45 mi) who moved to the Lindstrom Peninsula shortly after their arrival. By the 1960s, they developed a community at what is now the Inuit hamlet of Grise Fiord, 8 km (5 mi) to the east. "Mount Aqiatushuk". The Atlas of Canada. Archived from the original on 2012-10-02.
