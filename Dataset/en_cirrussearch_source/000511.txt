On May 16, 2014, Šiškauskas was named a EuroLeague Basketball Legend. Šiškauskas played with the junior national teams of Lithuania. With Lithuania's junior national team, he played at the 1998 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship. Šiškauskas was a member of the senior men's Lithuanian national basketball teams that won the bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics, and the bronze medal at the EuroBasket 2007.

After the 2008 Summer Olympics, he officially announced that he was stepping down from the Lithuanian national team as a player. Šiškauskas was a physical small forward, who could also easily play, both on offense and defense, in either the point guard or shooting guard positions, on the wing, and also in the paint. His excellent leaping ability, and his quickness, made him a surprising shot blocker, and one of the best one-on-one players and swingmen in Europe. He was considered the best defensive player of the senior Lithuanian national basketball team. He led the 2003–04 season of the Lithuanian League, in free throw percentage (90.6%). Šiškauskas began his basketball coaching career in 2017, when he became an assistant coach of the senior men's Lithuanian national basketball team. On May 15, 2009, Šiškauskas signed a contract extension with CSKA Moscow. He signed through 2011. Šiškauskas said of the contract: "I feel like the right man, in the right place in CSKA. I am happy with both the team, and the organization. That is why I don't see any reason to think about changes. I feel myself as a part of history of a great club, which is aiming for the highest goals. And that's what absolutely matches with my character." - Ramūnas Šiškauskas 2× Lithuanian League Champion: (2000, 2002) 2× Lithuanian League MVP: (2001, 2002) Lithuanian League Finals MVP: (2001) 4× Lithuanian League All-Star: (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004) North European League: Champion (2002) Italian Cup Winner: (2005) Italian League Champion: (2006) Italian League Finals MVP: (2006) Greek Cup Winner: (2007) 4× All-EuroLeague Team: 3× All-EuroLeague Second Team: (2007, 2009, 2010) All-EuroLeague First Team: (2008) 2× EuroLeague Champion: (2007, 2008) Greek League Champion: (2007) Triple Crown Champion: (2007) Greek League Best Five: (2007) Lithuanian Sportsman of the Year: (2007) EuroLeague MVP: (2008) 5× Russian League Champion: (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012) Russian League Player of the Year: (2009) VTB United League Final Four MVP: (2008) All-Europe Player of the Year: (2008) EuroLeague 2000–10 All-Decade Team: (2010) Russian Cup: Winner (2010) Russian League All-Star: (2011) Russian League All-Symbolic Second Team: (2011) 3× VTB United League Champion: (2008, 2010, 2012) EuroLeague Basketball Legend: (2014) 2000 Summer Olympics:  Bronze EuroBasket 2003:  Gold EuroBasket 2007:  Bronze EuroBasket 2007: All-Tournament Team 47. 6' 6" 220 1978 Lithuanian Ramunas Siskauskas---CSKA Moscow--Russia.
