Idrottsföreningen Brommapojkarna, more commonly known as Brommapojkarna (meaning the Bromma boys) or simply BP, is a Swedish football club located in the borough of Bromma, in the western parts of Stockholm municipality. Brommapojkarna is the largest football club in Europe in terms of the number of active youth teams of all ages – in 2007 there were 247 teams and 3,000 players. The women's team plays in Damallsvenskan, the first tier and the men's team plays in the Allsvenskan, the first tier. The club is famous for its youth academy, which has produced numerous top-quality Swedish players throughout the years. The club is affiliated to the Stockholms Fotbollförbund. The club was formed in 1942. It has earlier had many more sports on its programme, such as athletics, bandy and ice hockey. They became affiliated with Manchester United after Bojan Djordjic was transferred to the Red Devils in 1999. However, this deal has since expired as BP believed it would weaken talks with other Premiership clubs. The club now has a similar affiliation with local United rivals Manchester City, where former BP youth and Sweden International John Guidetti marked his trade, until his transfer to La Liga club Celta Vigo in 2015. The club was promoted to the Allsvenskan for the first time on 12 November 2006 after beating BK Häcken in the promotion-relegation play-offs. On 16 November 2008, the team reached Allsvenskan for the second time after a 1–1 draw against Ljungskile SK. It guaranteed remain in Allsvenskan for 2010 season despite losing 3–0 to home match against IFK Göteborg on October 23, 2009. In 2010, BP came in last and were relegated to Superettan, where they played in 2011 and 2012. In 2012 they finished 2nd in Superettan and were promoted to Allsvenskan for the third time.
