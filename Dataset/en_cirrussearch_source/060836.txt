Vovchansk (Ukrainian: Вовчанськ, pronounced [wou̯ˈt͡ʃɑnʲsʲk]; Russian: Волчанск, romanized: Volchansk) is a city in Chuhuiv Raion, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Vovchansk urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 17,459 (2022 estimate). The settlement was settled in 1674 when a territory of Belgorod Monastery was provided to Ukrainian settlers from Dnieper Ukraine led by Martyn Starochudny. The settlement was named as Vovche and designated as a guarding settlement. In April 1780 it was officially renamed as Vovchansk and became an administrative centre of Volchansk uyezd in the Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire. The year 1780 is considered by the Verkhovna Rada as the official date of the city establishment. Between 1674 and 1780 a lot of changes took place and the borders of the Russian Empire moved away from the settlement.[citation needed] In 1896 a Belgorod – Donbas railroad was installed through the town. A local newspaper has been published here since February 1918. It became a part of the Donets-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic, although in spring 1918 it was occupied by German troops. This lasted until November 1918.[citation needed] On April 12, 1923, an administrative-territorial reform was carried out in Ukraine. Vovchansk district was divided into 8 districts: Bilokolodyazhkyi, Velykoburlutskyi, Vovchanskyi, Zhovtnevyi, Pechenizkyi, Rubizhne, Khotimlianskyi, and Shypuvativskyi. In 1923, as part of the administrative reform, it became a district center. As of January 1, 1924, the population of Vovchansk district was 27,329 people. The town suffered as a result of the genocide of the Ukrainian people committed by the USSR government in 1932-1933, the number of identified victims in Vovchansk, Zavody Pershy, Zavody Druhni, Chapliivka, and Hergelivka was 1789 people. On June 10, 1942, Wehrmacht units occupied Vovchansk, and in August 1943, Soviet troops took over. In 1964, the construction of two reinforced concrete bridges over the Vovcha River on Lenin and Gagarin streets was completed and the district House of Culture was built. In 1966, the city's population amounted to 20600 people. In 1979, Vovchansk had a carriage factory, a building materials factory, an asphalt plant, an oil extraction plant, a bread factory, a butter factory, a shoe factory, a cotton factory, a furniture factory, a meat processing plant, a bakery, and a district agricultural machinery, a consumer services plant, 8 a medical school, an aviation school, a technical school of agricultural mechanization, three medical institutions, a House of Culture, six clubs, a cinema, and 14 libraries.[citation needed] The economic crisis that began in 2008 hit the local industry. A dairy factory that was built here by Soviet Union stopped work and in December 2009 ceased to exist. Until 18 July 2020, Vovchansk was the administrative center of Vovchansk Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kharkiv Oblast to seven. The area of Vovchansk Raion was merged into Chuhuiv Raion. Vovchansk was occupied by Russia during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and retaken by Ukraine on 11 September 2022 as part of a major counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region.
