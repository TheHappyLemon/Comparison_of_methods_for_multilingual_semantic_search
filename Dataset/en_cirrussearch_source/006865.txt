.mv is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Republic of Maldives. It is administered by Dhiraagu Pvt Ltd, a telecommunications company. Mainly due to the unavailability of an online registration service, a whois lookup and large maintenance cost, the Maldivian ccTLD is used predominantly by government agencies and large businesses. Smaller companies and organizations prefer generic TLDs such as .com and .net. .aero.mv – Aviation .biz.mv – Business organization .com.mv – Commercial .coop.mv – Cooperative organization .edu.mv – Educational institutions .gov.mv – Government .info.mv – Information .int.mv – International Organization .mil.mv – Military .museum.mv – Museums .name.mv – Personal .net.mv – Networks .org.mv – Organizations .pro.mv – Professionals .mv WHOIS information Application(s) v t e v t e
