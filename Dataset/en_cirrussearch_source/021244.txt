Mount Foster is a peak rising to 2,025 metres (6,644 ft) in the Imeon Range on Smith Island in the South Shetland Islands of the British Antarctic Territory. It is the highest point of the South Shetland Islands archipelago. Mount Foster has triple peaks of which Mount Foster proper is the southernmost, the central one is Evlogi Peak (2,024 m), and the northern one is Antim Peak (1,995 m). The first ascent was made by Greg Landreth and his team comprising Brice Dowrick, Dan Mannix and Roger Thompson on 29-30 January 1996. The feature is named after Captain Henry Foster, commander of HMS Chanticleer who explored the South Shetlands in 1829. Traditionally, the elevation of Mount Foster was put at 2,105 metres (6,906 ft). However, according to the American high accuracy Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA) edition 2022, the actual elevation (at 2-meter spatial resolution) is 2,025 m, just 1 m higher than the adjacent Evlogi Peak. Mount Foster is linked by Zavet Saddle (elevation 1,350 m) to Slaveykov Peak to the southwest and by a saddle of elevation 1,899 m to Evlogi Peak to the north-northeast. It surmounts Bistra Glacier to the west, Chuprene Glacier to the north-northwest, Rupite Glacier to the east, Landreth Glacier to the southeast and Dragoman Glacier to the south-southeast. The peak is located 5.45 km northeast of Riggs Peak, 2.78 km south-southeast of Garmen Point, 7.64 km southwest of Mount Pisgah and 3.86 km north-northwest of Ivan Asen Point (Bulgarian mapping in 2009).
