Jobava is credited with popularizing an opening sometimes called the Jobava London System, successfully employing it against Veselin Topalov and Ruslan Ponomariov, also known as the Rapport–Jobava System, which is characterized by the moves 1.d4, 2.Nc3, and 3.Bf4. The opening was first played by James Mason in 1882. He's one of the most prolific users of Larsen's Opening in the modern era, having beaten Yu Yangyi in the Tata Steel Challengers 2014, Daniil Dubov in the Bronstein Memorial 2014, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in the FIDE Grand Prix 2015 and David Howell in the FIDE Grand Swiss 2019 with it. On February 3, 2023, Jobava accused GM Xu Xiangyu of cheating after losing to him during the Airthings Masters Play-In and publicly berated chess.com team members after the game saying "Ban all these Chinese motherf***ers." This resulted in him being banned from all chess.com prize events for the remainder of 2023 for the alleged racism. His younger brother Beglar Jobava is also a chess player, an International Master.
