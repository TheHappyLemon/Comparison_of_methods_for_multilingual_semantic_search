The Autódromo de Buenos Aires Oscar y Juan Gálvez is a 45,000 capacity motor racing circuit in Buenos Aires, Argentina built in 1952 under president Juan Perón, named Autódromo 17 de Octubre after the date of Loyalty Day until Perón's overthrow. It was later renamed after Argentinian racing driver brothers, Juan Gálvez (1916–1963) and Oscar Alfredo Gálvez (1913–1989). The circuit was originally constructed on swampland in Villa Riachuelo, the southernmost barrio of Buenos Aires, and is situated on flat lands surrounded by large grandstands, giving most spectators an excellent view area of the whole circuit. The circuit is notable for the large number of alternative layouts to accommodate different forms of racing, with some races run without the twisty infield section, reducing lap times significantly. The 1000 km Buenos Aires sports car event used the Autódromo as well as sections of highway situated near the track from 1954 to 1960. The 1000 km event would return again from 1970 to 1972, but using just the Autódromo section. The 20 Formula One Argentine Grand Prix races were held in the Autódromo between 1953 and 1998. Formula One used a number of different configurations—the No.2 circuit was used from 1954–1960, the No.9 circuit was used from 1971–1973, and the very fast No.15 layout was used from 1974–1981 which added 2 long straights and a long third corner between the two straights often taken in top gear flat out, which provided an exciting view for spectators, especially when the cars exited the third corner often on the brink of spinning off or crashing at 305 km/h (190 mph). Going through the section, the cars were flat out for 40 seconds. The Argentine Grand Prix was dropped from the 1982 calendar because of Argentina's invasion of the Falkland Islands and Carlos Reutemann's sudden retirement after the 1982 Brazilian Grand Prix. The twisty No.6 configuration, though using S de Senna instead of Tobogán, was used from 1995–1998, but that version of the circuit was not popular with Formula One. After the 1998 race, there was no money for the race to be held and it was dropped. Ten Argentine motorcycle Grand Prix races were held in the Autódromo between 1961 and 1999. The Buenos Aires Grand Prix was held in the Autódromo from 1952 to 2009. 1952–1955: Autódromo 17 de Octubre 1955 – mid-1960s: Autódromo Municipal Ciudad de Buenos Aires Mid-1960s – 1989: Autódromo Municipal del Parque Almirante Brown de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires 1989–2008: Autódromo Oscar Alfredo Gálvez 2008–present: Autódromo Oscar y Juan Gálvez Circuit N° 1 (1952–1971) Circuit N° 2 (1952–1971) Reverse version of Circuit N° 2, used for 1954 Argentine Grand Prix Circuit N° 3 (1952–1971) Circuit N° 4 (1952–1971) Buenos Aires 1000km Circuit (1954, 1956, 1958, 1960) Buenos Aires 1000km Circuit (1955) Circuit N° 5 (1972–present) Circuit N° 6 (1972–present) Circuit N° 6 with Senna S used for Formula One 1995–1998 (1995–present) Circuit N° 6 in the version used for motorcycle racing 1987, 1994–1995, 1998–1999 Circuit N° 7 (1972–present) Circuit N° 8 (1972–present) Circuit N° 9 (1972–present) Circuit N° 9 with Senna S (1995–present) Circuit N° 12 (1972–present) Circuit N° 14 (1968–1971) Circuit N° 15 (1972–present) Circuit N° 15 with Senna S (1995–present) Layout usage 1952–1958: Buenos Aires Grand Prix (La Temporada) – Formula Libre (circuits: No.4, 1952 – No.2, 1953–1958) 1953–1998: Argentine Grand Prix – Formula 1 (circuits: No.2, 1953–60 – No.9, 1971–73 – No.15, 1974–81 – No.6, 1995–98) 1964–1978: Buenos Aires Grand Prix – Formula 2, Formula 3, Formula Junior (circuits: No.4 1964, No.15 1966–68, No.12 1978) 1983–1985: Buenos Aires Grand Prix – Formula 2 Codasur (circuit No.4) 1954–1960 / 1970–1972: 1000 km of Buenos Aires sports car series Grand Prix (1952 circuit No.1 plus various street layouts) 1961–1999: Argentine motorcycle Grand Prix (circuit No.6; except for 1982, circuit No.8) Current April: TC2000 Championship, Fórmula Nacional Argentina August: Turismo Carretera Buenos Aires Grand Prix, TC Pista October: TC2000 Championship 200 km de Buenos Aires, TCR South America Touring Car Championship, Stock Car Pro Series, F4 Brazilian Championship, TCR Brazil Touring Car Championship, Fórmula Nacional Argentina December: Turismo Nacional Former 200 Miles of Buenos Aires (1970) Buenos Aires Grand Prix (1952–1955, 1957–1959, 1964, 1966–1968, 1978, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1989–1999, 2001, 2006, 2008–2009) Campeonato Sudamericano de GT (2013) Copa Truck (2018) F4 Argentina Championship (2021) Formula 3 Sudamericana Buenos Aires Grand Prix (1987, 1989–1999, 2001, 2006, 2008–2009) Formula One Argentine Grand Prix (1953–1958, 1960, 1972–1975, 1977–1981, 1995–1998) Formula Truck (2009–2011) Grand Prix motorcycle racing Argentine motorcycle Grand Prix (1961–1963, 1981–1982, 1987, 1994–1995, 1998–1999) Porsche Cup Brasil (2011, 2017) Porsche GT3 Cup Trophy Argentina [es] (2018–2019) South American Super Touring Car Championship (1997–2001) Top Race V6 (1997–2000, 2002–2003, 2007–2011, 2017, 2020–2023) World Sportscar Championship 1000 km Buenos Aires (1954–1958, 1960, 1971–1972) As of October 2023, the fastest official race lap records at the Autódromo Oscar y Juan Gálvez are listed as: The 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011 Creamfields editions were held in the track, The Chemical Brothers, Carl Cox, John Digweed, LCD Soundsystem, James Zabiela, 2 Many DJs, Tiefschwarz, Steve Lawler, Satoshi Tomiie, Booka Shade, Deadmau5, David Guetta, Calvin Harris, among others playing here.
