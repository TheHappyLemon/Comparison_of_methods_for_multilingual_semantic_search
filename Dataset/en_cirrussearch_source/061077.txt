Amine Harit (Arabic: أمين حارث; born 18 June 1997) is a professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Ligue 1 club Marseille. Born in France, he plays for the Morocco national team. Born and raised in Pontoise to Moroccan parents, Harit acquired French nationality on 27 August 2003, through the collective effect of his parents' naturalization. Harit made his debut for the Ligue 1 side on 13 August 2016 against Dijon. He played the whole match in a 1–0 away win. On 10 July 2017, Schalke 04 announced the signing of Harit on a four-year contract. The transfer fee paid to Nantes was reported as €8 million, which could rise to €10 million with bonuses. He made his debut for the German club on 14 August in a DFB-Pokal against BFC Dynamo. He started the match and came off at halftime of a 2–0 away win. On 25 November 2017, Harit scored his first ever Bundesliga goal against Ruhr rivals Borussia Dortmund as Schalke overturned a 4–0 deficit to a 4–4 draw in a historic Revierderby match.[citation needed] He was named Bundesliga 'Rookie of the Month' for December 2017, going on to take the 'Bundesliga Rookie of the Year' award for the 2017–18 season. On 11 December 2019, Harit extended his contract with Schalke for a further three years, until 2024. On 2 September 2021, it was announced that Harit was loaned out to Ligue 1 club Marseille for the 2021–22 Ligue 1 season.
