In December 2014, Gashi was voted as the best player of the year in the Swiss Super League. At the end of the first half of the season, Gashi was included in the best eleven of the Swiss Super League. In February 2015, Gashi was proclaimed as the "Best Player of the Year 2014" in the Swiss Award, which was held by the Swiss Football Association at their gala for the past year. This because Gashi was 2013–14 top scorer with 19 goals, for the Grasshoppers and after his transfer to Basel during the summer, the striker closed the year again as top scorer for his new club.

The strike was later voted the 2016 MLS Goal of the Year. In the playoffs, he scored another stunning long-range goal, this time against the LA Galaxy, taking a shot from well outside the penalty box, and beating the keeper in a 1–0 win, which levelled the score on aggregate, and allowed the Rapids to subsequently win on penalties. It was considered a masterful performance by Gashi as they advanced to the Western Conference Championship game. Gashi scored his first goals of the 2017 season on 14 May 2017 against San Jose Earthquakes in a 3–0 victory. He scored the first and last goals in the 29th and 56th minutes.
