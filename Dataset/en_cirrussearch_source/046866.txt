Clube Desportivo Feirense, commonly known as CD Feirense or just Feirense, is a Portuguese football club based in Santa Maria da Feira. Founded on 18 March 1918, Feirense play in the LigaPro, the second tier of Portuguese football. Their chairman is Kunle Soname and their manager is Filipe Martins. The club plays its home matches at the Estádio Marcolino de Castro, with a capacity of 5,500 spectators. Founded in 1918, Feirense played only three Primeira Liga seasons in the 20th century – 1962–63, 1977–78 and 1989–90 – being relegated in each one. In 2009–10, the club came close to ending a two-decade exile but missed out on the last day, as local rivals S.C. Beira-Mar went up with Portimonense SC. The following year, Feirense went one better by coming second, missing out on the title on goal difference to Gil Vicente F.C. and winning promotion under Quim Machado in May 2011. However, a year later they were relegated. A four-season spell in the second tier ended with promotion in third place in May 2016, under manager José Mota. Mota left in December 2016 and was succeeded by his assistant Nuno Manta Santos, who took the team to a best-ever eighth place. After just staying up in 2018, Feirense went down in April 2019 with four games to play. The Estádio Marcolino de Castro is a multi-use stadium in the town of Santa Maria da Feira. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Feirense, who play in the Portuguese Liga. The stadium is capable of holding other sporting events. Its capacity for a football match is 5,500 spectators. Estádio Marcolino de Castro was built in 1962 when Feirense was promoted for the very first time to the top-flight Portuguese Liga.
