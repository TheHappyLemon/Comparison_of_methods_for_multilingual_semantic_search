The East German national men's ice hockey team was a national ice hockey representing the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The first international game was played in East Berlin on 28 January 1951, losing 3–8 to Team Poland. The team competed in many international competitions, including several in which they competed with the top teams for medals, but won only the European Championship bronze medal in 1966 in Yugoslavia. The only time they competed in the Olympics was in Grenoble in 1968. They scored 13 goals in 7 games, but didn't win any games leaving them with no points in the standings. From that point on the team refused to participate in Olympic ice hockey, but participated in other tournaments where they continued to play poorly. The team ceased playing in 1990, just before the German reunification. What would become the team's final game was played on 8 April 1990 in Megève during the B Group of the World Championship, and was lost to Austria, 2-3. In October 1990, Germany was re-unified. 1968 Winter Olympic team Ulrich Noack Bernd Karrenbauer Hartmut Nickel Helmut Novy Wolfgang Plotka Wilfried Sock Dieter Purschel Klaus Hirche Dieter Kratzsch Dieter Voigt Manfred Buder Lothar Fuchs Peter Prusa Joachim Ziesche Bernd Poindl Dietmar Peters Bernd Hiller Rüdiger Noack 1920 - 1955 - Did not participate (see German national ice hockey team) 1956 - Finished in 11th place (Won "B" Pool) 1957 - Finished in 5th place 1958 - Did not participate 1959 - Finished in 9th place 1961 - Finished in 5th place 1962 - Did not participate 1963 - Finished in 6th place 1965 - Finished in 5th place 1966 - Finished in 5th place 1967 - Finished in 7th place 1969 - Finished in 7th place (Won "B" Pool) 1970 - Finished in 5th place 1971 - Finished in 9th place (3rd in "B" Pool) 1972 - Finished in 9th place (3rd in "B" Pool) 1973 - Finished in 7th place (Won "B" Pool) 1974 - Finished in 6th place 1975 - Finished in 7th place (Won "B" Pool) 1976 - Finished in 8th place 1977 - Finished in 9th place (Won "B" Pool) 1978 - Finished in 8th place 1979 - Finished in 10th place (2nd in "B" Pool) 1981 - Finished in 12th place (4th in "B" Pool) 1982 - Finished in 9th place (Won "B" Pool) 1983 - Finished in 6th place 1985 - Finished in 8th place 1986 - Finished in 11th place (3rd in "B" Pool) 1987 - Finished in 13th place (5th in "B" Pool) 1989 - Finished in 13th place (5th in "B" Pool) 1990 - Finished in 13th place (5th in "B" Pool) 1991 and onward - Did not participate (see German national ice hockey team) Germany men's national ice hockey team "Matches internationaux 1950/51" (in French).
