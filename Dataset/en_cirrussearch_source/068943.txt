In the Philippines, provinces (Filipino: lalawigan or probinsiya) are one of its primary political and administrative divisions. There are 82 provinces at present, which are further subdivided into component cities and municipalities. The local government units in the National Capital Region, as well as independent cities, are independent of any provincial government. Each province is governed by an elected legislature called the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and an elected governor. The provinces are grouped into seventeen regions based on geographical, cultural, and ethnological characteristics. Thirteen of these regions are numerically designated from north to south, while the National Capital Region, the Cordillera Administrative Region, the Southwestern Tagalog Region (Mimaropa), and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao are only designated by acronyms. Each province is a member of the League of Provinces of the Philippines, an organization that aims to address issues affecting provincial and metropolitan government administrations. A provincial government is autonomous of other provinces within the republic. Each province is governed by two main elected branches of the government: executive and legislative. Judicial affairs are separated from provincial governance and are administered by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Each province has at least one branch of a Regional Trial Court. The provincial governor is chief executive and head of each province. Elected to a term of three years and limited to three consecutive terms, he or she appoints the directors of each provincial department which include the office of administration, engineering office, information office, legal office, and treasury office. The vice governor acts as the president for each Sangguniang Panlalawigan (SP; "Provincial Board"), the province's legislative body. Every SP is composed of regularly elected members from provincial districts, as well as ex officio members. The number of regularly elected SP members allotted to each province is determined by its income class. First- and second-class provinces are provided ten regular SP members; third- and fourth-class provinces have eight, while fifth- and sixth-class provinces have six. Exceptions are provinces with more than five congressional districts, such as Cavite with 16 regularly elected SP members, and Cebu, Negros Occidental and Pangasinan which have twelve each. Every SP has designated seats for ex officio members, given to the respective local presidents of the Association of Barangay Captains (ABC), Philippine Councilors' League (PCL), and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK; "Youth Council"). The vice governor and regular members of an SP are elected by the voters within the province. Ex officio members are elected by members of their respective organizations. National intrusion into the affairs of each provincial government is limited by the Philippine Constitution. The President of the Philippines however coordinates with provincial administrators through the Department of the Interior and Local Government. For purposes of national representation, each province is guaranteed its own congressional district. One congressional representative represents each district in the House of Representatives. Senatorial representation is elected at an at-large basis and not apportioned through territory-based districts. Those classified as either "highly urbanized" or "independent component" cities are independent from the province, as provided for in Section 29 of the Local Government Code of 1991. Although such a city is a self-governing second-level entity, in many cases it is often presented as part of the province in which it is geographically located, or in the case of Zamboanga City, the province it last formed part the congressional representation of. Local government units classified as "component" cities and municipalities are under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. In order to make sure that all component city or municipal governments act within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions, the Local Government Code mandates the provincial governor to review executive orders issued by mayors, and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan to review legislation by the Sangguniang Panlungsod (City Council) or Sangguniang Bayan (Municipal Council), of all component cities and municipalities under the province's jurisdiction. The provincial government does not have direct relations with individual barangays. Supervision over a barangay government is the mandate of the mayor and the Sanggunian of the component city or municipality of which the barangay in question is a part. Provinces are classified according to average annual income based on the previous 4 calendar years. Effective July 29, 2008, the thresholds for the income classes for cities are:[needs update] A province's income class determines the size of the membership of its Sangguniang Panlalawigan, and also how much it can spend on certain items, or procure through certain means. Manila (until 1901) – Incorporated into Rizal; portions around Manila later consolidated to form present-day NCR. Lepanto-Bontoc (1902–1908) – Incorporated into Mountain Province. Moro Province (1903–1913) – Converted to the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, composed of seven provinces. Now part of several regions in Mindanao. Ambos Camarines (1901–1908) – Divided into Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur, although the wording of Act No. 2809 implies Camarines Norte was created from Ambos Camarines, the remainder of which was renamed Camarines Sur. Camarines Sur retained the provincial capital of Nueva Caceres. Misamis (1901–1939) – Partitioned into Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental. Misamis Oriental retained the provincial capital of Cagayan. Mindoro (1902–1950) – Divided into Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro. Oriental Mindoro retained the provincial capital of Calapan. Zamboanga (1914–1952) – Partitioned into Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur. The de jure provincial capital of Molave was placed under the jurisdiction of Zamboanga del Sur which had its capital in Pagadian. Zamboanga Sibugay later created from Zamboanga del Sur. Lanao (1914–1959) – Divided into Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. Lanao del Sur retained the provincial capital of Dansalan (now Marawi). Surigao (1901–1967) – Partitioned into Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur. Surigao del Norte retained the provincial capital of Surigao City and the provincial seal. The province of Dinagat Islands was later created from Surigao del Norte. Davao (1914–1967; 1972–1998) – Divided into Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur and Davao Oriental. Davao del Norte was officially known as Davao from 1972 to 1998, when Compostela Valley (now Davao de Oro) was later created from Davao province. Davao Occidental later created from Davao del Sur. Agusan (1907–1967) – Partitioned into Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur. Agusan del Norte retained the former provincial capital of Butuan. The provincial capital was officially transferred to Cabadbaran in 2000 but the provincial government services and functions are yet to be completely transferred to the new capital. Negros del Norte (1985–1986) – Batas Pambansa Blg. 885, which created a new province out of the northern part of Negros Occidental, took effect on December 23, 1985, with a plebiscite to ratify the law held on January 3, 1986. The province comprised the present-day cities of Cadiz (which was to serve as the capital), Escalante, Sagay, San Carlos, Silay and Victorias, as well as the municipalities of Calatrava, Don Salvador Benedicto, Enrique B. Magalona, Manapla, and Toboso. Despite voters ratifying Batas Pambansa Blg. 885, on July 11, 1986, the Supreme Court declared the law and the proclamation of the province null and void. The ruling states the enabling law was unconstitutional for, among other things, not including the rest of Negros Occidental in the plebiscite, and the proposed province not meeting the 3,500 square kilometer land area requirement of the 1983 Local Government Code. Kalinga-Apayao (1966–1995) – Divided into Apayao and Kalinga. Kalinga retained the provincial capital of Tabuk. Shariff Kabunsuan (2006–2008) – Republic Act No. 9054 conferred to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao expanded powers, especially the capacity to create provinces (Article VI, Section 19). Based on this, the ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly enacted Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 201 on August 28, 2006. The Act created a new province, comprising all the municipalities in the first congressional district of Maguindanao (except Cotabato City), with its capital at Datu Odin Sinsuat. The province's creation was approved on October 28, 2006, by a majority vote in a plebiscite. Responding to requests for clarification as to which congressional districts form Shariff Kabunsuan for the 2007 elections (specifically whether Cotabato City was part of the representation of the new province), COMELEC issued Resolution No. 7845, which initially held Cotabato City to be the sole remaining LGU in the First District of Maguindanao. COMELEC later amended this with Resolution No. 7902, which maintained the status quo before the province's creation. The COMELEC resolutions became the subject of a case in which the Supreme Court opined that because "the power to create new a province or city inherently involves the power to create a legislative district"—a power that Congress did not explicitly delegate to the ARMM Regional Assembly—the creation of a province by a lower legislative body (the ARMM Regional Assembly) will necessarily entail the creation of a legislative district for a higher legislative body (Congress). Therefore, on July 16, 2008, the Supreme Court declared Section 19, Article VI of RA No. 9054 unconstitutional, MMA Act No. 201 void, and COMELEC Resolution No. 7902 valid. Maguindanao (1973–2022) – Republic Act No. 11550 divided the province into Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur through a plebiscite. Maguindanao del Norte resembles the former province of Shariff Kabunsuan however adds the municipality of Sultan Sumagka into its territory. The capital of Maguindanao del Norte is Datu Odin Sinsuat while the capital of Maguindanao del Sur is Buluan. When the United States acquired the Philippines from Spain in 1898, the islands were divided into four gobiernos (governments), which were further subdivided into provinces and districts.

Samal (1969) – The sub-province of Samal was created by Republic Act No. 5999 and covered the area of the present-day Island Garden City of Samal. However, the sub-province was never inaugurated. Maranaw (1971) – Republic Act No. 6406, which sought to create a new province out of eastern Lanao del Sur (now corresponding to the province's first congressional district), was approved on October 4, 1971. The province was to consist of the municipalities of Bubong, Ditsaan-Ramain (including what is now Buadiposo-Buntong), Kapai, Lumba-Bayabao (including what is now Maguing), Marantao, Masiu, Mulondo, Saguiaran, Piagapo, Poona Bayabao, Tamparan, Taraka and Wao (including what is now Bumbaran), with the chartered city of Marawi serving as the new province's capital. Lanao del Sur was to retain the remaining municipalities, with Malabang serving as its new capital. Section 4 of RA 6406 provided that "The new provinces as provided in this Act shall come into existence upon the election and qualification of their first elective provincial officials, who shall be elected in a special election simultaneously with the general elections of November, nineteen hundred and seventy-three." The division never took place due to the declaration of martial law in the Philippines on September 21, 1972, which disrupted the scheduled general elections for 1973 and paved the way for the adoption of a new Constitution and the establishment of the Fourth Philippine Republic. A legacy of this unimplemented division is the existence of two ZIP code series for Lanao del Sur: the 93- series was retained by what were to be the remaining towns of the province (with Malabang, the new capital, being reassigned the code 9300), while a new series (97-) was assigned to what was supposed to be the province of Maranaw (with Marawi getting the new code 9700). Isabela del Norte and Isabela del Sur (1995) – On February 20, 1995, Republic Act No. 7891, which sought to divide the province of Isabela, was approved. Isabela del Norte was to comprise municipalities belonging to the province's first and second congressional districts with Ilagan serving as capital. Isabela del Sur was to consist of the third and fourth congressional districts (excluding the independent component city of Santiago), with Cauayan as the capital. The proposed division was rejected in a plebiscite held on June 20, 1995. Quezon del Norte and Quezon del Sur (2007) – The act dividing the province of Quezon into two, Republic Act No. 9495, lapsed into law without the President's signature on September 7, 2007. Quezon del Norte (which would be renamed from Quezon) was to be composed of the first and second congressional districts of the province, with Lucena as its capital. Quezon del Sur, with its capital at Gumaca, would have been composed of the third and fourth congressional districts. The COMELEC held the plebiscite on December 13, 2008, and the majority of the votes rejected the division. Notwithstanding the voters' rejection, all the representatives of Quezon's four legislative districts—Wilfrido Mark Enverga, Irvin Alcala, Danilo Suarez, and Lorenzo Tañada III—reintroduced the measure as House Bill No. 3839 on December 8, 2010. They explained that “the wisdom, logic and bare facts behind what is driving this bill to be filed again in this Congress remain,” citing the persistence of poverty in far-flung coastal municipalities and small islands. Yet, the bill did not make it out of the committee level this time. Palawan del Norte, Palawan Oriental, and Palawan del Sur (2021) – On April 5, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11259 that proposed the division the province of Palawan, with the exception of the independent city of Puerto Princesa, into three separate provinces. A plebiscite was originally scheduled for the second Monday of May 2020 but was postponed to March 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Palawan del Norte would have been composed of Taytay and municipalities north of it. Palawan del Sur would have been composed of the municipalities west and south of Puerto Princesa, including Kalayaan (which administers the country's claims in the Spratly Islands), while the rest were proposed to form Palawan Oriental. The proposed provincial capitals would be Taytay (Palawan del Norte), Brooke's Point (Palawan del Sur), and Roxas (Palawan Oriental). The COMELEC held the plebiscite on March 13, 2021, and the majority of the votes rejected the division. Surigao Oriental (1992, 2015, 2022): House Bill No. 2336 seeks to carve a province out of the six southernmost local government units of Surigao del Sur province. The City of Bislig and the municipalities of Barobo, Hinatuan, Lingig, and Tagbina all comprise the district of the bill's author, Surigao del Sur 2nd District Representative Johnny T. Pimentel; the bill also seeks to transfer Lianga, currently part of the First District, to the proposed province. Bislig would be the designated capital. The bill is pending with the Committee on Local Government since August 2, 2022. A previous attempt to create the province of Surigao del Oriente, which would have covered the 2nd District municipalities but would have excluded Lianga, died in the committee level during the 16th Congress. The proposal to create a province called Surigao Oriental was raised as early as 1992 by then-2nd District Representative Ernesto T. Estrella. Zamboanga Occidental (2002, 2007, 2010, 2017, 2023) – On September 25, 2023, Zamboanga del Norte 3rd District Representative Adrian Michael A. Amatong filed House Bill No. 9311 seeking to create a new province out of his constituency. The proposed province would consist of the 12 westernmost municipalities of Zamboanga del Norte—Liloy as the proposed capital, together with Baliguian, Godod, Gutalac, Kalawit, Leon B. Postigo, Salug, Sibuco, Siocon, Sirawai, and Tampilisan. Previous attempts to turn the district into the province of Zamboanga Occidental, the province of Liloy, or the province of Zamboanga Hermosa—which began with the efforts of then-2nd District Representative Ernesto T. Estrella as early as 1992—failed to hurdle the 12th, the 14th, the 15th and the 17th Congress. Mindoro del Sur (1998): During the 11th Congress, Oriental Mindoro 1st District Rep. Renato Leviste filed House Bill No. 1476 proposing to turn the adjoining 2nd District into its own province called Mindoro del Sur. The proposed province would have consisted of the seven municipalities forming the southern half of Oriental Mindoro: Bansud, Bongabong, Bulalacao, Gloria, Mansalay, Pinamalayan, and Roxas. However, the measure did not take off. The Sangguniang Panlalawigan in 2002 passed a resolution urging the province's two representatives, Charity Leviste and Alfonso Umali, Jr., to refile the bill in the 12th Congress, but to no avail. Panguil Bay (1999): During the 11th Congress, Lanao del Norte 1st District Rep. Alipio Cirilo Badelles filed House Bill No. 8049 to carve the province of Panguil Bay out of Lanao del Norte. The bill died in the committee level. Bukidnon del Sur (2004): In November 2004, during the 13th Congress, Bukidnon 3rd District Rep. Juan Miguel F. Zubiri filed a bill seeking to carve the new province of Bukidnon del Sur out of the province of Bukidnon. The proposed province would have been composed of 10 southwestern and southern municipalities: Damulog, Dangcagan, Don Carlos, Kadingilan, Kalilangan, Kibawe, Kitaotao, Maramag, Pangantucan, and Quezon. The capital would have been determined by way of plebiscite had the bill passed into law. House Bill No. 4834 was unanimously approved on third reading by the House of Representatives on November 21, 2005, but it never moved past the committee level at the Senate. Cebu del Norte, Cebu del Sur, and Occidental Cebu (2005): During the 13th Congress, the province of Cebu grappled with the so-called Sugbuak controversy. Three bills were filed in January and February 2005 by 2nd District Rep. Simeon L. Kintanar, 3rd District Rep. Antonio P. Yapha, Jr., and 4th District Clavel A. Martinez, who sought to turn their respective constituencies into the new provinces of Cebu del Sur, Occidental Cebu, and Cebu del Norte, respectively. The consolidated substitute bill, House Bill No. 5721, was approved by the Committee on Local Government but was not acted upon by the Committee on Rules by the end of the 13th Congress amid strong opposition. Misamis North and Misamis South (2005): During the 13th Congress, Misamis Oriental 2nd District Rep. Augusto H. Baculio introduced two bills seeking to carve the provinces of Misamis North and Misamis South out of the province of Misamis Oriental. The bills died in the committee level. Western Leyte (2005, 2010): During the 13th and the 15th Congress, Leyte 5th District Rep. Carmen L. Cari and her son and successor Rep. Jose Carlos L. Cari introduced bills seeking to carve the new province of Western Leyte out of the province of Leyte. The Caris' constituency consisted of the City of Baybay and the eight southernmost municipalities of the province. The bills died in the committee level. Previously, during the 9th Congress, Leyte 4th District Rep. Carmelo J. Locsin filed House Bill No. 6388 also to create the province of Western Leyte; his district consists of the City of Ormoc and the surrounding western municipalities of Albuera, Isabel, Kananga, Matag-ob, Merida, and Palompon. Northwestern Samar (2008, 2010, 2019)  – Most recently during the 17th Congress, House Bill No. 8824 was introduced in the House of Representatives on January 22, 2019, by 1st District Representative Edgar Mary Sarmiento to turn his constituency into a new province called Northwestern Samar. The proposed province would have consisted of the City of Calbayog as its capital, along with the nine municipalities of Almagro, Gandara, Matuginao, Pagsanghan, San Jorge, Santa Margarita, Santo Niño, Tagapul-an, and Tarangnan. This proposal has repeatedly died in the committee level during the 14th, 15th and 17th Congress. Nueva Camarines (2011)  – On May 24, 2011, during the 15th Congress, Camarines Sur Fourth District Rep. Arnulfo Fuentebella introduced House Bill 4728, which sought to create a new province out of the City of Iriga and 16 municipalities comprising the eastern half and the southern portion of Camarines Sur. This would have included all 10 municipalities of Fuentebella's Fourth District (Caramoan, Garchitorena, Goa, Lagonoy, Presentacion, Sagñay, San Jose, Siruma, Tigaon, and Tinambac) and all six municipalities of the adjacent Fifth District (Baao, Balatan, Bato, Buhi, Bula, and Nabua). Tigaon would have been the capital of the proposed province. Just three months later, on August 3, 2011, the finalized measure numbered House Bill No. 4820 passed the House of Representatives of the Philippines with 229 votes in favor to one against. However, it failed to gain the concurrence of the Senate, which did not take up the controversial bill by the end of 15th Congress, following the opposition of Senators Joker Arroyo, Antonio Trillanes IV, Bongbong Marcos and Manny Villar. In 2015, Rappler reported: “It is widely believed here that the Fuentebellas want a new province they can rule because they had failed to win the governorship of Camarines Sur since former Governor Luis Villafuerte held the position.” Southern Leyte to Leyte del Sur (2007)  – Southern Leyte Lone District Rep. Roger Mercado introduced bills to rename the province of Southern Leyte to Leyte del Sur, citing a desire to “enhance the identity of [the province] as geographically a part of the Leyte Island with a distinct personality of its own” and to have the province alphabetically listed closer to the neighboring province of Leyte, from which it was separated in 1959. Mercado first filed the bill in 2007, and this attempt gained traction during the 14th Congress, as House Bill No. 6650 was passed by the House of Representatives on September 8, 2009, with 170 votes in its favor and none against it. The Senate, however, did not act on the measure. Mercado's second attempt in 2017 did not prosper, as House Bill No. 1602 died in the committee level during the 17th Congress.
