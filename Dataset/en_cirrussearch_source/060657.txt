It is also found in Central Europe and Pyrenees The preferred growing location is on moist, calcareous sands, such as those on some moors and dunes. The plant is a hemiparasite and can steal water and salts from grasses. Euphrasia stricta is used in herbal medicine to treat inflammatory eye conditions, most notably allergic conjunctivitis. The German Commission E did not consider there to be sufficient evidence to prove eyebright is useful for any condition. Human clinical trials are lacking to support traditional claims, though absence of evidence is not proof of inefficacy. Euphrasia rostkoviana Wikimedia Commons has media related to Euphrasia stricta.
