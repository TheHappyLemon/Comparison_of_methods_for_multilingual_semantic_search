Straupe (German: Groß-Roop) is a village in Straupe Parish, Cēsis Municipality in the Vidzeme region of Latvia. Before the village was founded, the area was a part of the ancient Idumea country. The village of Straupe began to develop around the Lielstraupe Castle in the 14th century. Later became the trade center known in German as Roop, and received its town privileges in 1374. During the fourteenth century, Straupe flourished as part of the mercantile Hanseatic League. The town was destroyed during the Polish–Swedish War (1600–29). It is possible that Straupe name comes from the Livonian language word raupa, meaning "running water."
