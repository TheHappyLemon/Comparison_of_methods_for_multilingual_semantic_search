Xiaomi M365 or Mi Electric Scooter is a consumer electric scooter by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi. Released in December 2016, it debuted three months before the dockless rental scooter operator Bird commenced service. The M365 is the model used for the original Bird rental scooters. In terms of private ownership, the model is readily available in Europe, where it is said to have "democratized" the motorized kick scooter, due to its competitive price (often €350-€400), and it being one of the easiest scooters to operate. The electric motor is located in the front wheel making the M365 front wheel drive, while the battery and motor controller are located in the compartment under the deck. The brake lever triggers two braking systems, firstly regenerative braking (KERS) by the motor in the front wheel, followed by mechanical disk braking, located in the rear wheel, which ensures a short stopping distance. It has a folding mechanism, which can for example be used in public transport. The scooter used to be vulnerable to remote hacking, which included triggering the brake or speeding it up. Some units in select markets has been recalled due to a screw in the folding mechanism that became loose; this could cause the stem to break off while in use. The successor, called the M365 Pro, has "refined" the original M365 by including a colour graphical display, an increased range of 45 km (28 miles), as well as more power from the electric motor, at 300W (peak 600W). The length and width of the deck has also been increased, improving comfort. Safety improvements have also been made, including a larger disk for the rear brake.
