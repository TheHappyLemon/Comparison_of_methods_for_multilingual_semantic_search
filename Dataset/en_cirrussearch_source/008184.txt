Bullet in a Bible is a live album by American rock band Green Day, released on November 15, 2005, by Reprise Records. It was directed by Samuel Bayer, who was the director of all the videos from American Idiot. Bullet in a Bible documents one of the two biggest shows that Green Day have performed in their career; they played in front of a crowd of over 130,000 people at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in United Kingdom on June 18–19, 2005. This was also the hottest weekend of the year, because the United Kingdom was in the middle of a heatwave, with temperatures reaching 33 degrees Celsius. The band was supported by Jimmy Eat World, Taking Back Sunday, and Hard-Fi during their American Idiot world tour. Fourteen of the twenty songs performed at these shows were included on the disc; missing out were the tracks "Jaded", "Knowledge", "She", "Maria", "Homecoming" and "We Are the Champions". However, "She" was broadcast on BBC Radio 1 as part of their coverage of the event. Bullet in a Bible was released as a double-LP set on November 10, 2009, as part of the band's 2009 vinyl re-release campaign. Green Day have released most of the videos from this concert on their YouTube page except for "Boulevard of Broken Dreams", "Wake Me Up When September Ends", and the other songs which have been omitted from the album release. Bullet in a Bible peaked on the Billboard 200 at number eight and spent 14 weeks on the chart. It has also reached top 10 positions in many European countries. All lyrics are written by Billie Joe Armstrong; all music is composed by Green Day, except where noted IGN review Archived 2009-04-16 at the Wayback Machine Bullet in a Bible at AllMusic Larkin, Colin (2011).
