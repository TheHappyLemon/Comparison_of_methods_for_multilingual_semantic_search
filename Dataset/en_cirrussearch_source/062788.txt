The 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League was the second season of the UEFA Europa Conference League, Europe's tertiary club football tournament organised by UEFA. The final was played at Fortuna Arena in Prague, Czech Republic. It was won by West Ham United, who defeated Fiorentina 2–1, and qualified for the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League group stage as a result. As the title holders, Roma qualified for the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League. They were unable to defend their title after advancing to the Europa League knockout phase. A total of 177 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations (excluding Russia) participated in the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League. The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: Associations 1–5 each had one team qualify. Associations 6–17 (except Russia) and 51–55 each had two teams qualify. Associations 18–50 (except Liechtenstein) each had three teams qualify. Liechtenstein had one team qualify as they organized only a domestic cup and no domestic league. Moreover, 18 teams eliminated from the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League and 25 teams eliminated from the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League were transferred to the Europa Conference League. For the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2021 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2016–17 to 2020–21. Apart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Europa Conference League, as noted below: (UCL) – Additional teams transferred from the UEFA Champions League (UEL) – Additional teams transferred from the UEFA Europa League The following was the access list for this season. In the default access list, the title holders of the Europa Conference League qualified for the Europa League group stage. Due to the suspension of Russia for the 2022–23 European season, the following changes to the access list were made: The cup winners of association 16 (Serbia) enter the Europa League third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round. The cup winners of associations 18 (Croatia) and 19 (Switzerland) enter the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round. The cup winners of associations 30 to 39 (Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Ireland, North Macedonia and Armenia) enter the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round. Since several changes were made in the Europa League access list following the qualification of the Europa Conference League title holders to the Europa League group stage, the following changes to the access list were made: The cup winners of association 17 (Czech Republic) enter the Europa League third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round. The cup winners of association 20 (Greece) enter the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round. The cup winners of associations 40 (Latvia) and 41 (Albania) enter the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round. Moreover, in the default access list, originally 16 losers from the Champions League first qualifying round were transferred to the Europa Conference League second qualifying round (Champions Path). However, since the Champions League title holders, Real Madrid, which were guaranteed a berth in the Champions League group stage, already qualified via their domestic league, only 15 losers from the Champions League first qualifying round were transferred to the Europa Conference League second qualifying round (Champions Path) after the Champions League access list was rebalanced. As a result, only 16 teams entered the Champions Path second qualifying round (two of the losers from the Champions League first qualifying round were drawn to receive byes to the third qualifying round). The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round: CW: Domestic cup winners 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, etc.: League position of the previous season Abd-: League positions of abandoned season as determined by the national association; all teams were subject to approval by UEFA LC: League cup winners RW: Regular season winners PW: End-of-season Europa Conference League play-offs winners UCL: Transferred from the Champions League Q1: Losers from the first qualifying round PR: Losers from the preliminary round (F: final; SF: semi-finals) UEL: Transferred from the Europa League GS: Third-placed teams from the group stage PO: Losers from the play-off round CH/MP Q3: Losers from the third qualifying round (Champions/Main Path) The second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round were divided into Champions Path (CH) and Main Path (MP). CC: 2022 UEFA club coefficients. One team not playing in a national top division will take part in the competition: Vaduz (2nd tier). Notes Champions League (UCL Q1): Two of the Champions League first qualifying round losers were drawn to receive byes to the third qualifying round (Champions Path), as two fewer losers were transferred to the second qualifying round (Champions Path), due to Champions League group stage berths vacated following the UCL title holders qualifying via league position and the suspension of Russia from the 2022–23 European season. Armenia (ARM): Noravank would have qualified for the Europa Conference League second qualifying round as the winners of the 2021–22 Armenian Cup, but failed to obtain a UEFA license. As a result, the berth reserved for the second qualifying round was given to the second-placed team of the 2021–22 Armenian Premier League, Ararat-Armenia, who originally entered the first qualifying round, and the berth reserved for the first qualifying round was given to the fourth-placed team, Ararat Yerevan. Liechtenstein (LIE): The seven teams affiliated with the Liechtenstein Football Association (LFV) all played in the Swiss football league system. The only competition organised by the LFV was the Liechtenstein Football Cup – the winners of which qualified for the UEFA Europa Conference League. Russia (RUS): On 28 February 2022, Russian football clubs and national teams were suspended from FIFA and UEFA competitions due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 2 May 2022, UEFA confirmed that Russian clubs would be excluded from the 2022–23 UEFA competitions. Ukraine (UKR): The 2021–22 Ukrainian Premier League was abandoned due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The fourth and fifth-placed teams of the league at the time of the abandonment (Zorya Luhansk and Vorskla Poltava) were selected to play in the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League by the Ukrainian Association of Football. The schedule of the competition was as follows. Matches were scheduled for Thursdays apart from the final, which took place on a Wednesday, though exceptionally could take place on Tuesdays or Wednesdays due to scheduling conflicts (especially featuring teams from associations where there were few approved stadiums, such as Gibraltar and Wales). Scheduled kick-off times starting from the group stage were 18:45 and 21:00 CEST/CET, though exceptionally could take place at 16:30 due to geographical reasons. As the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place in Qatar between 20 November and 18 December 2022, the group stage commenced in the first week of September 2022 and concluded in the first week of November 2022 to make way for the World Cup.

In the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows: In the draw for the knockout round play-offs, the eight group runners-up were seeded, and the eight Europa League group third-placed teams were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. In the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight winners of the knockout round play-offs were unseeded. Again, the seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. In the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals, there were no seedings, and teams from the same association could be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals were held together before the quarter-finals were played, the identity of the quarter-final winners was not known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw was also held to determine which semi-final winner would be designated as the "home" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it was played at a neutral venue). The draw for the knockout round play-offs was held on 7 November 2022, 14:00 CET. The first legs were played on 16 February, and the second legs were played on 23 February 2023. The draw for the round of 16 was held on 24 February 2023, 13:00 CET. The first legs were played on 7 and 9 March, and the second legs were played on 15 and 16 March 2023. The draw for the quarter-finals was held on 17 March 2023, 14:00 CET. The first legs were played on 13 April, and the second legs were played on 20 April 2023. Notes Order of legs reversed after original draw. The draw for the semi-finals was held on 17 March 2023, 14:00 CET, after the quarter-final draw. The first legs were played on 11 May, and the second legs were played on 18 May 2023. The final was played on 7 June 2023 at the Fortuna Arena in Prague.
