Lehi (/ˈliːhaɪ/ LEE-hy) is a city in Utah County, Utah, United States. The population was 75,907 at the 2020 census, up from 47,407 in 2010, and it is the center of population of Utah. The rapid growth in Lehi is due, in part, to the rapid development of the tech industry region known as Silicon Slopes. A group of Mormon pioneers settled the area now known as Lehi in the fall of 1850 at a place called Dry Creek in the northernmost part of Utah Valley. It was renamed Evansville in 1851 after David Evans, a local bishop in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Other historical names include Sulphur Springs and Snow's Springs. The settlement grew so rapidly that, in early 1852, Bishop Evans petitioned the Utah Territorial Legislature to incorporate the settlement. Lehi City was incorporated by legislative act on February 5, 1852. It was the sixth city incorporated in Utah. The legislature also approved a request to call the new city Lehi, after a Book of Mormon prophet of the same name. The first mayor of Lehi was Silas P. Barnes, from 1853 to 1854. The downtown area has been designated the Lehi Main Street Historic District by the National Park Service and is on the National Register of Historic Places. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 26.7 square miles (69.1 km2) of which 26.3 square miles (68.2 km2) is land and 0.35 square miles (0.9 km2), or 1.28%, is water.

Lehi Roller Mills was founded in 1906 by a co-op of farmers. George G. Robinson purchased the mill in 1910, and it has since remained in the Robinson family, currently run by George's grandson, R. Sherman Robinson. The mill produces some 100,000 pounds of flour each day. The turkey and peacock flour paintings of Lehi Roller Mills were painted on the silos about 1930 by Stan Russon of Lehi, Utah. He used a rope and pulley system to manually raise and lower himself to be able to paint. Lehi Roller Mills was featured in the 1984 film Footloose as Ren McCormack's workplace and as the site of the dance. At the time the film was made, Lehi Roller Mills was surrounded by nothing but vacant fields. In one scene, the Reverend Shaw Moore and his wife Vi Moore keep a wary eye on the proceedings while standing in a field some distance away. The area is now home to a variety of fast food restaurants and a shopping center. The Lehi Roller Mills were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1994. In 2012, the Mills filed for bankruptcy with the intention of continuing to operate during the proceedings. Thanksgiving Point is a nonprofit museum complex and estate garden founded in 1995.

It is the site for the region's only Tulip Festival, an annual Scottish Festival, annual Cornbelly's Halloween attraction, and Highland Games. The complex is a 501(c)(3) organization with operations funded by private donations, venue and event admissions, and profits from shops and restaurants. The Hutchings Museum is a museum located near the center of Lehi. It was first established in 1955 in what is now the Lehi Arts Building. The museum later moved its current location in the Veteran Memorial Building at 55 N Center St, Lehi, UT. The collection was donated to the city by John and Eunice Hutchings, who were amateur collectors and naturalists. Originally designed to be a memorial for the veterans in World War I, the Veteran Memorial Building later expanded to host a library, courthouse, jail, police station, and fire station, among others. The Hutchings Museum's exhibits include a large range of displays and artifacts featuring Native American culture, geology and paleontology, ornithology, live animals, and both local city and regional history. Some of the Museum's most notable artifacts include a gun that reportedly belonged to Butch Cassidy, a large collection of rocks and minerals, and several pieces of Native American pottery.
