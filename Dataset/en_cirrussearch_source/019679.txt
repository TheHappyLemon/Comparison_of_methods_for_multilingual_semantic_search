Already in 1978 she was supposed to be on the Soviet woman's team playing at the 23rd Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires. However, the entire team consisted of Georgian players, and Soviet officials replaced Ioseliani - the youngest - for a Russian-born player. Ioseliani was on the Soviet team during the 24th and 25th Olympiads. Later she joined the Georgian team in the 30th Chess Olympiad and again in the 31st and 32nd. Her team won gold all five times.

In 1979 and in 1980 she was the girls winner of the European Junior Chess Championship. She has twice won the candidate's tournament to play for the Women's World Chess Championship. In 1988 she challenged defending champion Maia Chiburdanidze, and lost by 8½ to 9½ (+2, =11, -3). In 1993 she played Xie Jun, and lost by 2½ to 8½. She has won the Women's Soviet Chess Championship four times. Ioseliani also played for Georgia in the 1997 World Team Chess Championship, scoring 1½/7 on board 2.
