Allabogdanite is a very rare phosphide mineral with the chemical formula (Fe,Ni)2P, found in 1994 in a meteorite. It was described for an occurrence in the Onello meteorite in the Onello River basin, Sakha Republic; Yakutia, Russia; associated with taenite, schreibersite, kamacite, graphite and awaruite. It was named for Russian geologist Alla Bogdanova. In a June 2021 study, scientists reported the discovery of terrestrial allabogdanite in a sedimentary formation. It is located in the Negev desert of Israel, just southwest of the Dead Sea. Glossary of meteoritics List of minerals List of minerals named after people Warr, L.N. (2021).
