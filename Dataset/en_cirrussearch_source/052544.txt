Yandeks, IPA: [ˈjandəks]) is a Russian multinational technology company providing Internet-related products and services, including an Internet search engine called Yandex Search, launched in 1997, information services, e-commerce, transportation, maps and navigation, mobile applications, and online advertising. Yandex Holding Company was incorporated in 2000. As of 2016, it primarily served audiences in Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Turkey and countries with a significant Russian-speaking population. As of 2017, the firm was the largest technology company in Russia. It had more than 30 offices worldwide in 2018. Its main competitors in the Russian market are Google, Microsoft, VK, and Rambler. Yandex Search has the largest market share of any search engine from Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, and is the third largest search engine worldwide after Google and Bing. Yandex LLC's holding company, Yandex N.V., is a naamloze vennootschap (Dutch public limited company) with its head office listed at an address of a virtual office in Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.

In February 2024, Yandex N.V. announced the sale of the majority of its Russia-based assets to a consortium of Russia-based investors. In 1993, Arkady Volozh and Ilya Segalovich, friends since their school days and by then working together to develop search software, invented the word "Yandex" to describe their search technologies. The name initially stood for "Yet Another iNDEXer". However, this is also a bilingual pun on "index" since "Я" ("ya") means "I" in Russian. Another pun is based on the yin and yang contrast (Russian: инь – индекс, ян – яндекс).[citation needed] On September 23, 1997, the Yandex.ru search engine was launched and presented at the Softool exhibition in Moscow. Initially, the search engine was developed by Comptek. In 1998, Yandex launched contextual advertisement on its search engine.[citation needed] In 2000, Yandex was incorporated in Cyprus as a standalone company by Arkady Volozh. In September 2005, it opened an office in Ukraine and launched www.yandex.ua. In 2007, Yandex introduced a customized search engine for Ukrainian users; Yandex also opened its development center in Kyiv in May 2007. In 2008, Yandex extended its presence in Ukraine by increasing bandwidth between Moscow data centers and UA-IX in Ukraine fivefold.

In September 2022, Yandex bought back 98.7% of issued Yandex N.V convertible bonds. In April 2022, TechCrunch reported that Yandex signed an agreement with VK holding with regard to the sale of News and Zen media services together with the main page yandex.ru In September 2022, News, Zen, and yandex.ru were transferred to a new owner.

The main part of the business will be placed into a separate group of companies that will keep the Yandex brand, which may be registered in Russia. The international parts of some businesses will be placed into separate companies under the control of Dutch Yandex N.V. which will itself eventually leave the shareholders of Russian Yandex Group. In March 2023, the NASDAQ exchange announced its intention to delist Yandex and a number of other companies doing business in Russia. Yandex appealed this decision. NASDAQ granted the appeal, given the company's plans to separate Russian and foreign businesses. The suspension of trading remains in effect.

As of 2021, Yandex had offices in 12 countries. In 2001, the company launched the Yandex.Direct online advertising network.

In 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism said that Yandex-delivered ads promoted misinformation about the war in Ukraine which were produced by more than half a dozen Russian-language news sites. Many of the articles displayed in Yandex's news aggregators were also from Russian state-owned and state-sponsored sources while the top search results about the war would sometimes prominently feature pro-war websites. Yandex.Games is an Internet gaming platform made by Yandex, which is available on both browser and mobile.[citation needed] As of 2022, the number of games included in the catalog exceeded 10,000, with more than 11 million players a month.

Developers add their games to the catalog independently and edit them in the future. All games are moderated. Mandatory requirements include integration with the Yandex.Games SDK, support for HTTPS and offline Service Worker mode. Game developers follow the updates of the platform in the blog, and content is provided by companies all over the world (e.g. Dutch media platform Azerion). In addition to a wide system of user ratings and reviews, the service uses complex algorithms to create personalized collections: games that have already been played, or those that are likely to be played. On 16 February 2018, the company showed off the first tests of its autonomous cars in Moscow. On 5 December 2018, Yandex announced the release of their first smartphone, the Yandex.Phone. In May 2023, Yandex implemented the YandexGPT generative neural network in the virtual assistant Alice. Between 2021 and 2023, Yandex introduced automatic voice-over translation for any YouTube video in English, Chinese, French, Spanish and German. On 7 June 2023, the company launched a test of its first self-driving taxi in Moscow. Toloka AI bv is a subsidiary of Yandex. The company focuses on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Training facial recognition software requires a lot of human work. To teach a computer what is on a photo, thousands of images must be manually categorized. Through Toloka's online platform, users worldwide can, in exchange for a small fee, carry out assignments that generate data for training facial recognition software. Two companies within the Moscow surveillance system, Tevian and NTechLab, did business with the Toloka company. The facial recognition software from Tevian and NtechLab had been used in Moscow since at least 2017. Yandex Russia created a separate platform for analysis tasks for Russian users and customers, called Yandex Tasks. The company started migrating Russian customers from Toloka to Yandex Tasks in December 2023 and works with NTechLab. The Kremlin planned in 2024 to use NTechLab's software for a secret center that will collect and analyze CCTV footage from across Russia. The aim of the project is to 'identify threats in a timely manner' and 'monitor individuals for destructive and/or disloyal behavior'. In 2009, Yandex began development on its project MatrixNet. It was a unique patented algorithm for the building of machine learning models, which used one of the original gradient boosting schemes. In July 2017, the CatBoost library was released to the public. It implements the Matrixnet algorithm for the building of machine learning models. At the time of release, the technology was already in use as part of a collaborative project with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) to analyze the results of conducted particle experiments CatBoost is used by foreign companies. For example: JetBrains uses it for code completion, CloudFlare for bot detection, and Careem for trip-distance determination. In 2012, Yandex began research and development within the field of natural-speech processing. And in October 2023, the company introduced Yandex SpeechKit. It is a speech-recognition and synthesis technology as well as a public API for speech recognition that Android and iOS developers can use. In 2022, the company published the source code for the YDB database management system. It is used in its own voice assistant Alice as well as in Yandex.Go and Yandex Market services. In 2023, Yandex published the source code for YTsaurus. It is a platform for work with big data. Yandex is an investor in several foreign companies. Examples include: Vizi Labs, Face.com, Blekko, and SalesPredict. On June 1, 2017, Yandex closed its offices in Kyiv and Odesa, Ukraine after the Security Service of Ukraine raided the offices and accused the company of illegally collecting Ukrainian users' data and sending it to Russian security agencies. The firm denied any wrongdoing. In May 2017, all Yandex services were banned in Ukraine by Presidential Decree No. 133/2017. In October and November 2018, Yandex was targeted in a cyberattack using the Regin malware, aimed at stealing technical information from its research and development unit on how users were authenticated. An investigation by Kaspersky Lab attributed the hacks to Five Eyes intelligence agencies. In June 2019, RBC News reported that Yandex had refused a request by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) under the Yarovaya law to surrender encryption keys that could decrypt the private data of its e-mail service and cloud storage users. The company argued that it was impossible to comply with the relevant law without compromising its users' privacy. Maxim Akimov, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, said that the government would take action to relieve FSB pressure on the company. Alexander Zharov, head of the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media, subsequently said that Yandex and the FSB had reached an agreement where the company would provide the required data without handing over the encryption keys. In February 2021 Yandex admitted that one of their system administrators with access rights to Yandex's email service had enabled unauthorized access, leading to almost 5,000 Yandex email inboxes being compromised. On January 25, 2023, a leaked archive with approx. 44 GB of Yandex services was shared on BreachForums via BitTorrent. In June 2023 Yandex was fined by the Moscow court for its repeated refusal to share user information with the Federal Security Service. In April 2014, a film about the history of Yandex called Startup was released. On 20 April 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia, Yandex made its home coronavirus testing service free of charge for all residents of Moscow and its surroundings, extending it to other regions in the future. Previously, it announced the launch of the service on 16 April. In late March 2022, Yandex was the subject of a Financial Times investigation that had been initiated by the nonprofit organization Me2B Alliance as part of an application auditing campaign led by researcher Zach Edwards. Edwards and four expert researchers, including Cher Scarlett, a former Apple security engineer, found that a software development kit (SDK) called AppMetrica, a product of Yandex, was harvesting data from more than 52,000 applications such as a user's device fingerprint and IP address and storing it in Russia on Yandex's servers, which they said due to Russian law, and the nature of SDKs, could be accessed by Russian authorities without their knowledge and used to identify them. Yandex said of identification by the data collected: "Although theoretically possible, in practice it is extremely hard to identify users based solely on such information collected." Of authority requests for data they said: "Any requests that fail to comply with all relevant procedural and legal requirements are turned down." According to Meduza investigation published on 5 May 2022, since 2016 the top-5 news on the Yandex's main page are formed on the basis of a secret list of Russian media approved by Presidential Administration of Russia, which includes only pro-Kremlin media. Yandex stated that the highest-ranked news on its main page is generated automatically through its algorithm. Because of laws around news aggregators, only news received from registered media sources may appear on it. In March 2022, Yandex began to look for ways to offload its news aggregator and blogging-recommendation platform as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as the Kremlin's increased control of the media and freedom of expression. Yandex sought to focus on something that "under no circumstances can be politicized in any way. Under the current conditions, it is impossible to continue developing content and information services that affect a large number of people." In September 2022, Yandex sold its media assets. The company transferred News, Zen, and also the main page yandex.ru to VK Holding.
