With the club at the European-wide level, he also played in 28 FIBA Saporta Cup games (2nd European Level), in 23 FIBA SuproLeague games, and in 34 EuroLeague games (1st European level). In 2001, he was signed by the Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv, as a replacement for Nate Huffman, who was expected to leave the club. At the last moment though, Huffman decided to return to the club for one more season, so Maccabi sent Vujčić on loan to the French club ASVEL Villeurbanne. Vujčić helped ASVEL win the French League championship, for the first time in 21 years. He also played in 14 EuroLeague games that season (2 with Maccabi and 12 with ASVEL), in which he averaged 15.7 points and 6.4 rebounds per game. With Maccabi Tel Aviv, From 2002 to 2008, he won two EuroLeague championships (2004 and 2005), five Israeli Super League championships, four Israeli State Cups, and one Israeli League Cup.

On 25 October 2010, he signed a contract with the Turkish Super League club Efes Pilsen. After playing with Split, from 2011 to 2013, he announced his retirement from playing professional basketball. As a member of the senior Croatian national team, Vujčić played at the 1999 EuroBasket, the 2001 EuroBasket, the 2005 EuroBasket, and the 2009 EuroBasket. After he retired from playing professional basketball, Vujcic opened up his own basketball academy, in his home-town of Split, Croatia, where he would go on to help train young players to improve their basketball skills. Two of the main prospects to have been a part of the academy were Dragan Bender, who eventually became the number 4 overall pick of the 2016 NBA draft, and Ante Žižić, who was drafted 23rd overall in the same draft. In the 2013–14 season, Vujčić returned to one of his former clubs from his playing days, Maccabi Tel Aviv, to work as the team's manager. After he took over that position, Maccabi Tel Aviv went through an historic down period for the club, as at one point, the team had failed to win three consecutive Israeli national league championships (2015–2017), and at another point, had also failed to reach the EuroLeague's postseason phase four years in a row (2016–2019). Subsequently, many Israeli sports journalists and basketball analysts claimed that the team's inability to achieve its goals was due to the policies that had been implemented by Vujčić. Vujčić, was born in Vrgorac, in inland Dalmatia, SR Croatia, in the former SFR Yugoslavia. On 17 January 2018, after he had lived in Israel for 10 years, the Israeli Ministry of Interior granted a temporary Israeli citizenship to Vujčić and his family, after he had requested it.
