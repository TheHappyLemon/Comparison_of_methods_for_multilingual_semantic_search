Stefano Pirazzi (born 11 March 1987) is an Italian professional road bicycle racer, who currently rides for UCI Continental team Amore & Vita. Born in Alatri, Pirazzi has competed as a professional since 2010, joining Colnago–CSF Inox from the amateur ranks; his twin brother Roberto is also a cyclist, and was also a member of the Palazzago Rad Logistica team with Stefano in 2009. In May 2017, one day before the start of the 2017 Giro d'Italia, the UCI announced that Pirazzi and Bardiani–CSF team-mate Nicola Ruffoni had tested positive for growth hormone-releasing peptides in out-of-competition controls carried out the previous month. Later that month the UCI confirmed that both riders' B-samples had also tested positive, leading Bardiani–CSF to confirm that they would terminate both riders' contracts. In October, Pirazzi was given a four-year ban backdated to the date of the original announcement – as a result, he was unable to compete again until May 2021. Following the completion of his ban, he joined the Amore & Vita team, making his first start at the Mercan'Tour Classic Alpes-Maritimes. 2007 1st Stage 3 Giro delle Regioni 4th Giro del Canavese 6th Gara Ciclistica Milionaria 8th Overall Volta a Lleida 1st Mountains classification 1st Stages 4 & 5b 2008 3rd Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships 7th Cronoscalata Gardone Valtrompia 2009 1st Gara Milionaria Montappone 3rd Trofeo Internazionale Bastianelli 6th Giro del Cigno 2011 1st Mountains classification, Giro della Provincia di Reggio Calabria 1st Young rider classification, Giro del Trentino 3rd Overall Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 2012 1st Mountains classification, Tirreno–Adriatico 2013 1st Mountains classification, Giro d'Italia 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships 7th Overall Giro del Trentino 2014 1st Stage 17 Giro d'Italia 4th Time trial, National Road Championships 2015 2nd Giro dell'Appennino 2016 4th Overall Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 1st Stage 4 "Amore e Vita, domani in Francia il debutto di Stefano Pirazzi" [Amore & Vita, Stefano Pirazzi's debut in France tomorrow].
