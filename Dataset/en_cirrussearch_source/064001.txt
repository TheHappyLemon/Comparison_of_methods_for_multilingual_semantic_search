Avena strigosa (also called lopsided oat, bristle oat or black oat; syn. Avena hispanica Ard.) is a species of grass native to Europe. It has edible seeds and is often cultivated as animal feed in southern Brazil. It is sometimes reported as a weed. Avena strigosa is a tufted grass growing to a height of 0.8–1.5 m. Its seeds are smaller than those of the common oat, Avena sativa. Avena strigosa used to be cultivated as human food in Scotland, but it is now cultivated as a forage for ruminants in South America. It is a nutritive grass with a good protein content. Heuzé V., Tran G., Hassoun P., Lebas F., 2015. Black oat (Avena strigosa).
