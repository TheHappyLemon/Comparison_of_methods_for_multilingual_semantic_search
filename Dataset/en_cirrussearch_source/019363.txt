Year 1127 (MCXXVII) was a common year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. March 2 – Charles I (the Good), count of Flanders, is murdered; he leaves no children. King Louis VI (the Fat) appoints William Clito (son of Robert Curthose) as new ruler. But the Flemish towns of Bruges, Ghent, Saint-Omer and Ypres recognize (with English financial support) Thierry of Alsace as rival count. Spring – The forces of Alfonso VII perform a siege on the city of Guimarães, which ended in their withdrawal. Summer – King Roger II of Sicily claims the Hauteville possessions in Italy as well the overlordship of Capua. However, a coalition of Norman noblemen in Apulia and Calabria resist (supported by Pope Honorius II) against Sicilian rule. The same year, Roger regains control over Malta after a rebellion. Roger II establishes a pact with the maritime Republic of Savona to guarantee the security of the Mediterranean Sea, probably following an Almoravid raid against the Sicilian realm. December 18 – Conrad III (with support of the imperial cities, Swabia and Austria) is elected and crowned as anti-king of Germany at Nuremberg. King Henry I arranges the marriage of his daughter Matilda (the widow of Emperor Henry V) to the 14-year-old Geoffrey of Anjou (son of Count Fulk V). This is done to ensure an alliance between England and Anjou, and to prevent Fulk allying with Louis VI. Henry I has the English nobles swear allegiance to Matilda as the rightful heir to the throne. Upon his death, her cousin Stephen of Blois crosses the channel and usurps her throne, becoming the King of England. She wages a lengthy civil war known as the Anarchy, which lasted from 1135-1154.

June 12 – Qin Zong's younger brother, the 20-year-old Gao Zong, re-establishes the Song Dynasty (as the Southern Song Dynasty) in Lin'an (modern-day Hangzhou) and is proclaimed emperor.
