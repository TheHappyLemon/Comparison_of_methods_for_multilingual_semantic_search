Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 6.5 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Kyann-Sian Williams from NME enjoyed the album, saying, "At times, in the past, he has relied on his autotune to compensate for lacklustre lyricism, but Future is a megamind whose pioneering spirit is the very reason trap feels alive today. With I Never Liked You, you'll happily applaud him for that". In a positive review, Rolling Stone's Mosi Reeves said, "I Never Liked You is no DS2, but it has a compositional sweep often absent from his work. Most importantly, it's an album with layers that's more engaging than recent fare such as 2019's appealing yet boilerplate Future Hndrxx Presents: The Wizrd and Save Me EP; and 2020's one-two punch of desultory hive-bait, High Off Life and Pluto × Baby Pluto, the latter with Lil Uzi Vert". Exclaim! critic Michael Di Gennaro said, "It's not a complete return to form, but it's a reminder that even later in the journeys, all-time greats' talent and dedication to their craft can still yield impressive results". Reviewing the album for HipHopDX, Anthony Malone stated, "I Never Liked You continues his stagnation from High Off Life, settling for comfort rather than experimentation. The songs are rehashes he's done more effectively in the past. His signature consistency is still there". In a lukewarm review, Pitchfork's Alphonse Pierre wrote, "Stymied by formulaic collaborations and unmemorable beats, the rapper's latest has the ingredients of a really good Future album but lacks the depth of one". Robin Murray of Clash said, "It's not a bad record – the highs more than justify your entrance – but with a rumoured follow up on the way, perhaps it's time for Future to break a few of his own rules once more". I Never Liked You debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, earning 222,000 album-equivalent units (including 6,000 copies in pure album sales) in its first week. This became Future's eighth US number-one, 15th US top-10 album and the largest week for any album in 2022 at the time. The album also accumulated a total. of 283.75 million on-demand official streams for the album's tracks. In its second week, the album dropped to number two on the chart, earning an additional 116,000 units. In its third week, the album dropped to number three on the chart, earning 89,000 more units. In its fourth week, the album dropped to number four on the chart, earning 77,000 units. On November 30, 2022, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 1,000,000 units in the United States. The album was the seventh best-selling album of the 2022 in the United States, according to Hits, moved a total 1,328,000 album-equivalent units (including 16,000 copies in pure album sales).
