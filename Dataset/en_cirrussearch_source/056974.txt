The 1958–59 European Cup was the fourth season of the European Cup, Europe's premier club football tournament. The competition was won by Real Madrid, who beat Reims 2–0 in the final at Neckarstadion, Stuttgart, on 3 June 1959. This was Real Madrid's fourth European Cup title in a row. The two finalists also competed in the final of the first European Cup in 1956. It was the first time that a team from Finland participated, while Turkey's representative returned to the competition in the presence of Beşiktaş. They were drawn againts Olympiacos, but Greece's first ever entrants withdrew for political reasons before playing their first tie. Also, Manchester United were invited to the competition following Munich air disaster in the previous season, but were not allowed to participate by the Football League, meaning that first ever walkovers took place in the UEFA organised competition. Had they played, England would be first nation in European Cup history to have more than one team in the competition, apart from title holder's association. A total of 28 teams were placed in the competition bracket, but finally only 26 participated. Spain continued to be represented by its runners-up, as its champions Real Madrid had already qualified as holders. This was the first time that Rapid Wien and AGF Aarhus failed to qualify for the tournament, which made Real Madrid the only club to appear in all four editions of European Cup. Wiener Sport-Club, Standard Liège, Kjøbenhavns Boldklub, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Helsingin Palloseura, Schalke 04, Drumcondra, Juventus, Jeunesse Esch, VV DOS, Ards, Polonia Bytom, Petrolul Ploiești, Hearts, Atlético Madrid, IFK Göteborg, Beşiktaş and NK Dinamo Zagreb made their debut in the competition.[citation needed] All entrants were their respective associations champions, except for KB, Manchester United, Polonia Bytom and Atlético Madrid.

Reims were runners-up for a second time, having already lost to Real in the inaugural final in 1956. 3 June 1959 20:00 CET Neckarstadion, Stuttgart Attendance: 72,000 Referee: Albert Dusch (West Germany) The top scorers from the 1958–59 European Cup were as follows: Olympiacos withdrew due to international political issues, refusing to play in Istanbul following the long-standing tension between Turkey and Greece.. UEFA invited Manchester United to enter the competition after eight of the club's players were killed in the Munich air disaster while returning from a European Cup match in Belgrade the previous season; however, the Football League refused to allow the club to compete. As the draw had already been made for the preliminary round, Manchester United's drawn opponents, Young Boys, were given a bye to the first round of the competition. Instead, the two clubs played a pair of friendlies against each other, home and away; Young Boys won the first match 2–0 in Bern, but Manchester United won 3–0 at Old Trafford a week later. The two clubs were again drawn together in the group stage of both the 2018–19 and 2021–22 UEFA Champions League seasons, with the former happening almost exactly 60 years after they were originally due to play. Corriere dello Sport, 3 July 1958. Manchester United was in pot 2 because they could not play against an English club before the round of 16. Corriere dello Sport.
