Progress MS-12 (Russian: Прогресс МC-12), Russian production No.442, identified by NASA as Progress 73P, was a Progress spaceflight operated by Roscosmos to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). This was the 164th flight of a Progress spacecraft. The Progress-MS is an uncrewed freighter based on the Progress-M featuring improved avionics. This improved variant first launched on 21 December 2015. It has the following improvements: New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites. Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers. First time installed on Progress MS-03. Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism. Improved Micrometeoroid (MMOD) protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment. Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations. GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination. Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station. New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations. The Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V on board radio system and antenna/feeder system has been replaced with a Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS). Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system. In 2014, the launch was planned for 1 July 2018, rescheduled for 5 June 2019 and rescheduled to 31 July 2019. The liftoff had been initially set for the two-day rendezvous profile with the station, but the launch time was later shifted to enable a two-orbit (three-hour) flight to the station. Progress MS-12 was launched on 31 July 2019, at 12:10:46 UTC from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, using a Soyuz-2.1a rocket. Progress MS-12 docked with the Pirs docking module. The docking took place 3 hours 18 minutes 31 seconds into the mission (a new record time). The Progress MS-12 spacecraft delivered 1,164 kg (2,566 lb) of dry cargo (in the cargo compartment). 420 kg (930 lb) of water (in the Rodnik-system tanks) 51 kg (112 lb) of oxygen (in pressurized bottles) 850 kg (1,870 lb) of propellant in the refueling section 880 kg (1,940 lb) of propellant in the integrated propulsion system to the International Space Station. The dry cargo consisted of: 394 kg (869 lb) of hardware for onboard systems 27 kg (60 lb) of medical supplies 1 kg (2.2 lb) of personal protective gear 190 kg (420 lb) of hygiene items 7 kg (15 lb) of repairs and servicing equipment 20 kg (44 lb) of means of crew support 282 kg (622 lb) of food 13 kg (29 lb) of payloads 38 kg (84 lb) of structural components and other hardware 192 kg (423 lb) of NASA cargo. The Progress MS-12 craft undocked from ISS on 29 November 2019 at 10:25 UTC, initiated braking maneuver at 13:39 UTC, re-entered Earth's atmosphere at 14:11 UTC (end of mission), with any remaining debris impacting a remote part of Pacific Ocean at 14:19 UTC.
