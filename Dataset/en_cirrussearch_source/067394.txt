TV5 (also known as 5 and formerly known as ABC) is a Philippine free-to-air television and radio network. It is headquartered in Mandaluyong, with alternate studios located in Novaliches, Quezon City. TV5 serves as the flagship property of TV5 Network, Inc., which is owned by MediaQuest Holdings, the multimedia arm of telecommunications conglomerate PLDT. The network is commonly referred to as "The Kapatid Network", using the Filipino term for "sibling", a branding introduced in 2010. TV5 derives its name from its flagship station in Metro Manila, DWET-TV, which broadcasts on VHF Channel 5 for analog transmission, UHF Channel 18 for digital transmission, and UHF Channel 51 for digital test transmission (licensed to TV5's sister company, Mediascape/Cignal TV). In addition to DWET-TV, TV5 operates seven other owned-and-operated stations and has nine affiliate television stations. Its programming is available on cable and satellite TV providers nationwide. TV5's content is also accessible outside the Philippines through Kapatid Channel and AksyonTV International. Joaquin "Chino" Roces, the owner of the Manila Times, obtained a radio-TV franchise through Republic Act 2945 from Congress on June 19, 1960. He went on to establish the Associated Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with its initial studios located along Pasong Tamo. ABC's first radio stations were DZMT 1100 kHz, DZTM 1380 kHz, and DZWS 1070 kHz. ABC became the fourth television network in the Philippines when it launched DZTM-TV Channel 5. From 1960 to September 23, 1972, ABC operated both radio and television services. However, on September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared Martial Law, resulting in the forced shutdown of ABC and the Manila Times. Other networks like ABS-CBN, RBS, MBC, and RMN–IBC also had their radio and television broadcasts halted as a result of martial law. After the People Power Revolution in 1986, Chino Roces successfully advocated for the network's reinstatement with President Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino. While ABS-CBN reopened in the same year, ABC did not resume operations until it conducted a test broadcast in 1991 and officially reopened in 1992. Chino Roces died in 1988, but his son Edgardo Roces played a key role in reopening the network. Following Chino Roces's death, new stakeholders led by broadcast veteran Edward Tan and Edgardo Roces worked towards resuming broadcasts. They obtained approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission for an increase in capitalization and amendments to ABC's articles of incorporation and by-laws. Subsequently, they were granted a permit to operate by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC). ABC completed the construction of its studio complex and transmitter tower in San Bartolome, Novaliches, Quezon City in 1990. Test broadcasts began at the end of 1991, featuring documentaries from Japan. On February 21, 1992, the network officially returned to the air as the Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC). The flagship station adopted the callsign DWET-TV, and the corporate name became Associated Broadcasting Company, using the initial "C" instead of "Corporation" as the corporate initial. This change reflected the new management of the revived network. On February 4, 1994, ABC launched nationwide satellite broadcasting. The network experienced rapid growth and earned a reputation as "The Fastest Growing Network" under the leadership of network executive Tina Monzon-Palma, who served as Chief Operating Officer. On December 9, 1994, ABC obtained a 25-year legislative franchise through Republic Act No. 7831, which authorizes the network to establish and operate television and radio stations across the country. In 2001, ABC started producing local versions of popular game shows, including The Price Is Right (hosted by Dawn Zulueta, later acquired by ABS-CBN), Wheel of Fortune (hosted by Rustom Padilla, later acquired by ABS-CBN), and Family Feud (hosted by Ogie Alcasid, later acquired by GMA Network, then by ABS-CBN, and eventually returned to GMA). This move came during a period of game show popularity among Philippine networks, influenced by the success of IBC's Philippine editions of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (hosted by Christopher de Leon, later transferred to TV5 and hosted by Vic Sotto) and The Weakest Link (hosted by Edu Manzano). In June 2003, the joint consortium of Tan and Roces sold ABC TV and radio stations to a group led by businessman Antonio "Tonyboy" O. Cojuangco, Jr. Cojuangco, the former Chairman of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and owner of Dream Satellite TV and Bank of Commerce, formally acquired the assets in October of the same year. Cojuangco became the president and CEO of ABC, with Jose T. Pardo, a former secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry, serving as the network's board chairman. Under the new management, significant changes were introduced, including strengthening the news and public affairs division, modernizing broadcast equipment, and acquiring broadcast rights for Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) games. The network executives, led by Roberto Barreiro, also coined a new slogan, "Iba Tayo!" ("We're Different!"), during the "network wars" between ABS-CBN and GMA. ABC aimed to differentiate itself by offering fresh and distinct programming formats, targeting the growing middle to upper-class youth market. While implementing these changes, ABC continued to support the Family Rosary Crusade and featured the religious pre-identification campaign "Please Pray the Rosary" before its programs, although this gradually phased out during the network's programming revamp. In 2005, ABC received the "Outstanding TV Station" award at the 2005 KBP Golden Dove Awards, and several programs on the network also received awards in their respective categories. However, in early 2007, ABC implemented budget cuts that mainly affected its news department, resulting in significant layoffs and a diminished capacity for coverage. The cuts were implemented before the 2007 general elections. In November 2007, ABC launched new sports programming, including NBA basketball, professional boxing, and WWE events, as part of a five-year deal with Solar Entertainment. However, due to high costs and poor ratings, these programs were gradually dropped throughout 2008. The NBA review show "House of Hoops" was cut back and eventually cancelled by April 2008. The PBA, which was previously aired on ABC, did not have its contract renewed and instead found a new home on RPN through a partnership with Solar Entertainment, leading to RPN's privatization by Solar in 2011. In March 2008, Tonyboy Cojuangco announced a partnership between ABC and MPB Primedia Inc., a local company backed by Media Prima Berhad of Malaysia. The partnership was part of a long-term strategy to enhance ABC's competitiveness in the network wars between ABS-CBN and GMA. MPB Primedia Inc. was established as a seed asset for Media Prima's proposed private equity fund to invest in media companies in Southeast Asia. Under the agreement, MPB Primedia Inc. would produce and source entertainment programs, while ABC would continue to be responsible for news programming and station operation. MPB Primedia was granted exclusive rights to schedule and manage sales of ABC-5's airtime. Christopher Sy was appointed CEO of MPB Primedia, Inc. but resigned in January 2009 due to reported differences in management style. ABC aired its final broadcast at around 22:00 PHT on August 8, 2008, with its late-night newscast Sentro as the last program. A countdown to the network's relaunch followed until 19:00 PHT the next day when it officially rebranded as TV5. The network retained its alternative programming lineup but aimed to cater to "progressive Pinoys, including those young at heart" from market classes C and D. TV5 unveiled its upgraded 120-kilowatt state-of-the-art stereo TV transmitter. Some ABC programs, such as Shall We Dance, Nick on TV5, Kerygma TV, Light Talk, and Sunday TV Mass, were carried over to TV5's lineup. In December 2008, GMA Network, Citynet Television, and ZOE Broadcasting Network filed a lawsuit against ABC, MPB, and MPB Primedia, alleging that TV5's lease of airtime to Media Prima was an attempt to bypass regulations on foreign ownership of broadcasting companies. ABC's media relations head, Pat Marcelo-Magbanua, maintained that the network was a Filipino company that complied with local regulations. Despite the lawsuit, TV5 experienced a ratings revival under the new management. Its audience share increased from 1.9% in May–June 2008 (before the rebranding) to 11.1% in September 2009. On October 20, 2009, Media Prima announced its intention to divest its share in MPB Primedia / TV5, along with its affiliate ABC TV stations, and sell it to MediaQuest Holdings, the broadcasting division of PLDT. The decision was driven by the company's losses during the year. The acquisition was officially announced by Chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan on March 2, 2010. A new lineup of programming was introduced through a trade launch at the World Trade Center, and the network rebranded itself as the "Kapatid" ("sibling") network to compete with ABS-CBN and GMA Network. The acquisition did not include Dream FM and its affiliate stations, which remained under the management of the Cojuangco family. Instead, the Cojuangcos acquired a non-controlling share in Interactive Broadcast Media to continue operating the stations, which collectively became known as the Dream FM Network. However, Dream FM ceased operations in June 2011, with its flagship Manila station sold to Ultrasonic Broadcasting System and relaunched as Energy FM. On October 1, 2010, TV5 took over the management of MediaQuest's Nation Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) stations. DWFM was relaunched as Radyo5 92.3 News FM (now 92.3 Radyo5 True FM), a TV5-branded news radio station, on November 8, 2010. DWNB-TV was rebranded as AksyonTV on February 21, 2011, a news channel based on TV5's newscast Aksyon. TV5 experienced success and outranked GMA Network to become the second most-watched network in key cities in Visayas and Mindanao, including Iloilo, Cebu, Bacolod, Davao, and Cagayan de Oro. It even shared the top spot with ABS-CBN in General Santos. On December 23, 2013, TV5 began broadcasting from its new headquarters, the TV5 Media Center located in Reliance, Mandaluyong. In 2014, ABC Development Corporation acquired the Filipino broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics, 2014 Summer Youth Olympics, and the 2016 Summer Olympics. Despite financial struggles, TV5 remained one of the top three television networks in the country, with a strong following among male and younger viewers. The network's programming, such as the PBA via Sports5 and the TV5 Kids block, contributed to its popularity. TV5 celebrated its fifth anniversary under the management of Manny V. Pangilinan with a trade launch of 2015 shows at the Sofitel Philippine Plaza on November 26, 2014. TV5 started each year with a New Year's Eve countdown called "Happy sa [year]" at the Quezon Memorial Circle, a tradition that continued until 2017. In 2015, the network changed its corporate name from ABC Development Corporation to TV5 Network, Inc. However, the network faced increasing losses and debts due to a decline in advertisers and the impact of digitalization. This led to a series of employee layoffs, with the biggest retrenchment occurring in September 2015. TV5's in-house entertainment division faced dissolution, and its Chief Entertainment Content Officer, Wilma Galvante, concluded her consultancy contract. The network's workforce decreased from 4,000 employees in 2013 and 2014 to approximately 900 employees as of late 2021. Unable to produce original content until 2020, TV5 appointed Vicente "Vic" Del Rosario, CEO of Viva Entertainment, as the network's Chief Entertainment Strategist. Changes were implemented in TV5's entertainment programming, including the formation of the Viva-TV5 joint venture Sari-Sari Channel and the outsourcing of Viva Television for entertainment shows. The partnership was announced at a trade launch in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig on November 25, 2015. However, several of the new shows were cancelled due to lack of advertisement support and poor ratings. TV5 renewed its partnership with Viva Entertainment in October 2020, focusing on local versions of foreign programming and TV remakes of Viva classic films. From January 2016 until December 31, 2018, TV5 and Cignal, through Hyper, served as the official free-to-air and pay television partners, respectively, for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in the Philippines. In July 2016, TV5 started airing selected programs from MTV and MTV International as part of a deal with Viacom International Media Networks. The new MTV on TV5 block included shows like Catfish, Ridiculousness, and Ex on the Beach. On September 8, 2016, TV5 cancelled its locally produced programs Aksyon Bisaya and Aksyon Dabaw due to cost-cutting measures. However, the personnel remained employed to continue filing reports for the national edition of Aksyon. TV5 President and CEO Emmanuel "Noel" C. Lorenzana stepped down on September 30, 2016, and was replaced by basketball coach and Sports5/D5 Studio head Vicente "Chot" Reyes. Following Reyes' appointment, the network announced a retrenchment of approximately 200 employees as part of TV5's digitalization efforts. In April 2017, TV5 acquired the rights to air WWE programming after Fox Philippines decided not to renew its contract with the WWE. On October 12, 2017, TV5 Network announced its partnership with ESPN, obtaining the licensing rights for PBA, UFC, PSL, and NFL, as well as access to ESPN programs and content. The partnership led to the formation of the ESPN5 brand, which aired on TV5 and AksyonTV. The move was part of TV5's temporary shift from a general entertainment station to a sports and news channel. On February 17, 2018, TV5 underwent a rebranding and was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply 5. The new logo featured the removal of the word "TV" and was designed to be more flexible for other divisions to use it as part of their own identity. The programming grid was divided into three blocks: ESPN5 for sports, News 5 for news programs, and On 5 for other content. Additionally, D5 Studio focused on digital content, while Studio 5 produced Filipino productions for various platforms. The Kapatid moniker was de-emphasized during this period and mainly used by News5 and ESPN5 for some programs. The network gradually phased out Filipino-dubbed movies and foreign-acquired programming, which had been a practice since 2008, while Disney programs and movies aired in their original audio until 2019. On January 13, 2019, TV5 introduced a variation of its 2018 logo, which included the respective websites of the division producing the program as part of their on-screen graphics following the launch of 5 Plus. On April 22, 2019, TV5's legislative franchise was renewed for another 25 years under Republic Act No. 11320. On June 3, 2019, Chot Reyes retired as TV5 President and CEO and was succeeded by Jane Basas, who also led pay-TV provider and radio company Cignal TV/Mediascape. Under Basas' leadership, the network outsourced news and sports programming from its co-owned Cignal channels, phased out daytime ESPN5 programs, and focused on archived entertainment programs and expanded movie blocks on 5 Plus. Future plans for the network included retaining existing news programs and sports content in primetime and reintroducing original entertainment programming through outsourcing. Perci Intalan returned as the head of programming in November. On February 4, 2020, Robert P. Galang was appointed as the new president and CEO of TV5 Network and Cignal TV, replacing Basas. Basas, in turn, was appointed as the Chief Marketing Officer of Smart Communications. On March 8, 2020, 5 Plus was relaunched as One Sports and the ESPN5 division was renamed and merged into the brand. The sports programming on 5 no longer carried the ESPN5 banner. The ESPN5 partnership continued online, with ESPN5.com serving as the sports portal of both One Sports and ESPN in the Philippines until October 13, 2021. TV5 Network announced on the same day that 5 would be rebranded as One TV, originally scheduled for April 13, 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and negative reactions from viewers and fans, the rebranding was postponed to July 20, until it was ultimately canceled. The network brought back the TV5 brand on July 20, 2020, and introduced new Filipino-dubbed series and more entertainment content during primetime. On July 27, 2020, Cignal TV, TV5, and Smart Communications announced a multi-year deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the league's official broadcast rights in the Philippines, replacing Solar Entertainment Corporation. The games during the 2019-2020 season were aired live on free-to-air networks TV5 and One Sports. This marked the return of the NBA to TV5 since the partnership between the then-ABC 5 and Solar Entertainment Corporation from 2007 to 2008. On August 15, 2020, TV5 reverted to its former name, TV5, and announced a partnership with sister company Cignal TV to handle its programming. This partnership aimed to bring back the network's competitive edge and allow it to compete with other TV networks in the Philippines, including GMA Network. TV5 unveiled its first wave of entertainment programs produced by blocktimers such as Archangel Media, ContentCows Company, Inc., Luminus Productions, Inc., Viva Television, and Brightlight Productions. Additionally, shows from ABS-CBN that were affected by the network's franchise non-renewal were transferred to TV5. The network also expressed its willingness to hire displaced employees from ABS-CBN. In mid-September 2020, TV5 announced a second wave of programs for October, including shows produced by Viva Entertainment, Brightlight Productions, and News5. On January 18, 2021, TV5 started carrying selected programming produced by ABS-CBN after the shutdown of its free-to-air network. TV5 simulcast Kapamilya Channel programming, including shows like ASAP Natin 'To, FPJ: Da King movie block, Kapamilya Gold, Primetime Bida and Yes Weekend! lineup, and Magandang Buhay. This agreement was made between ABS-CBN, Cignal TV, and Brightlight Productions. TV5 introduced its revamped programming under the slogan "TV5 TodoMax," dividing programs into five blocks: TodoMax Kids, TodoMax Serbisyo (Idol in Action), TodoMax Panalo (afternoon programming lineup), TodoMax Primetime Singko, and TodoMax Weekend. Following the programming revamp, TV5 became the second most-watched TV network in primetime TV ratings, according to the AGB-Nielsen survey. The network's strengthened primetime programs from ABS-CBN Entertainment and Cignal Entertainment contributed to this achievement. On May 20, 2021, TV5 launched its new slogan "Iba sa 5" (It's different on 5) along with a new station jingle, station ID, and a darker red scheme for its 2019 logo. On July 1, 2022, the network introduced a new slogan, "Iba'ng Saya pag Sama-Sama" (The Fun is One of a Kind When We're Together), accompanied by a new station jingle and station ID. In June 2022, ABS-CBN engaged in advanced talks with MediaQuest Holdings, TV5's parent company, to explore a partnership. This came after Advanced Media Broadcasting System, backed by the Villar Group, acquired ABS-CBN's former frequency and planned to launch as All TV 2. On August 10, 2022, ABS-CBN and MediaQuest Holdings signed a "convertible note agreement" for ABS-CBN's investment in TV5 Network, acquiring 34.99% of the company's common shares with an option to increase the stake to 49.92% within the next eight years. MediaQuest Holdings remained the controlling shareholder with 64.79% of TV5's common shares. Additionally, MediaQuest Holdings acquired a 38.88% minority stake of ABS-CBN's cable TV arm, Sky Cable Corporation, through Cignal TV, with an option to acquire an additional 61.12% of Sky Cable shares within the next eight years. However, the partnership agreement was terminated on September 1 following concerns from politicians and government agencies. On January 31, 2023, Guido R. Zaballero was appointed as the president and CEO of TV5 Network, effective February 1, 2023. This appointment followed the retirement of Robert P. Galang, who had been leading Cignal TV and TV5 since 2020. Jane J. Basas assumed the role of president and CEO of Cignal TV while also serving as the president and CEO of MediaQuest, the holding company of TV5 and Cignal TV. On March 21, 2023, TV5 announced the launch of its main channel in high-definition (HD) feed, presented in a full-screen format, on Cignal TV. This development aimed to provide viewers with improved visual quality and enhanced viewing experience. The channel officially launched as TV5 HD on April 1, 2023. Subsequently, on April 16, 2023, TV5 began broadcasting in anamorphic 16:9 aspect ratio on free-to-air digital television. This change allowed for a widescreen presentation, optimizing the viewing experience for viewers with compatible widescreen televisions. TV5, originally known as the Associated Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), has undergone various rebrandings throughout its history. Here is a summary of the network's branding changes: Associated Broadcasting Corporation (1960–1972): Founded by Joaquin "Chino" Roces in 1960, ABC was forced to shut down in 1972 due to the declaration of Martial Law by President Marcos. Associated Broadcasting Company (1992–2008): Fully restored in 1992 after being granted a new franchise, ABC was led by new stockholders Edward Tan and Edgardo Roces. Businessman Antonio O. Cojuangco Jr. acquired the company in 2003. TV5 (first era; 2008–2018): Renamed as TV5 after entering a partnership with MPB Primedia, Inc., backed by the Malaysian media group Media Prima Berhad. In 2010, Media Prima divested its share to MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., owned by Manuel V. Pangilinan. The TV5 branding became obsolete when the network was relaunched as "5" on February 17, 2018. 5 (The 5 Network) (2018–2020): TV5 was rebranded as The 5 Network or simply 5 in 2018. The network utilized a numerical 5 logo and divided its programming grid into news, sports, and entertainment. However, the TV5 branding was still used for sign-on and sign-off messages, social media accounts, and selected program teasers. "The 5 Network" branding was retired on August 14, 2020, but the numerical 5 logo variant from 2019 was retained. The "5" naming was reinstated in 2021 for TV5's current slogan, "Iba sa 5". One TV (canceled; 2020): Originally planned for rebranding on April 13, 2020, and later rescheduled for July 20, 2020, One TV was ultimately canceled due to viewer confusion and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, thus making the network reverting to the TV5 branding. TV5 (second era; 2020–present): TV5 was officially restored as the network's full-time identity on August 15, 2020, coinciding with the return of local entertainment programs. The "TV5" word is commonly used for program teasers on TV, radio, and social media. TV5 has used several logos throughout its history. Notable variations include the iconic cyclone logo used from the 1960s to 1995, the ABC logo with a yellow circle introduced in 2004, and the shaking television logo adopted after the 2008 relaunch. In 2018, TV5 introduced the numerical 5 logo, which dropped the "TV" word and incorporated the program title within the logo. A variation of this logo was unveiled in 2019, which featured a darker red color. TV5 offers a diverse range of programs covering news and public affairs, sports, movie programming, local dramas and soap operas, anime series, foreign cartoons, musical and variety shows, reality shows, comedy and gag shows, informative and talk shows, and more. The network is known for being the official broadcaster of the PBA games. Shortly after its relaunch in 2008, TV5 reportedly entered the Top 3 TV stations based on the AGB Nielsen survey. The network gained popularity for its TV5 AniMEGA anime programming block, which introduced numerous Filipino-dubbed Japanese anime series in Philippine television including Code Geass, Shakugan no Shana, Azumanga Daioh, Special A, Makibaoh, Toradora!, Clannad, Yatterman, D.Gray-man, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and Gundam 00. The network also gained attention for its original horror drama series Midnight DJ (2008–2011). TV5 gained notoriety for pioneering tabloid talk shows known for confrontations, physical fights, and scantily clad guests. Some of these programs include Face to Face, Face the People, Solved na Solved, and Idol in Action. In 2013, TV5 introduced the Weekend Do It Better and Everyday All The Way programming blocks, but many of the programs were discontinued due to low ratings. In 2014, the network launched a new set of programs under the "Happy Ka Dito!" campaign. In 2015, TV5 focused on light entertainment and sports with the "Happy sa 2015" campaign, introducing over a dozen new programs. The AniMEGA block made a comeback, featuring the popular anime series Sword Art Online. TV5's entertainment programming was produced by various content providers, including Unitel Productions, The IdeaFirst Company, and Content Cows Company Inc. In 2015, TV5 named Sari-Sari Channel as its main entertainment production outfit after signing a deal with Viva Entertainment. Director Brillante Mendoza collaborated with TV5 to produce made-for-TV movies under the Brillante Mendoza Presents umbrella in 2016. In the same year, the network also aired The Walking Dead and La Reina del Sur, both dubbed in Filipino. In 2017, TV5 partnered with Aniplus Asia to bring back the AniMEGA block, showcasing Japanese anime series such Attack on Titan: Junior High, Myriad Colors Phantom World, Kantai Collection, Knights of Sidonia, Norn9, and Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? The network also broadcast NFL games from 2017 to 2019 and selected local shows from Sari-Sari Channel under the Sari-Sari sa Weekends banner. Brillante Mendoza's crime drama series Amo premiered in 2018 after a long delay. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, TV5 filled the vacant slots with new programs due to the lack of sporting events. Tierra de Reyes, Betty sa NY, Reina de Corazones, and La Suerte de Loli were among the Spanish-language telenovelas dubbed in Filipino, along with the re-dubbed versions of Marimar, María Mercedes, and María la del Barrio. The network has also acquired the rights to broadcast the NBA games. In August 2020, TV5 launched new local entertainment programs produced by Brightlight Productions, Luminus Productions Inc., and Archangel Media. Additional programs from Brightlight Productions were also aired in October 2020. In 2021, TV5 and Cignal TV signed a partnership with ABS-CBN to air more of its popular content on free television. TV5 has been simulcasting selected programs from Kapamilya Channel's Magandang Buhay, FPJ: Da King, ASAP Natin 'To, and programs from the Kapamilya Gold, Primetime Bida and Yes Weekend! programming blocks, along with the Japanese anime series My Hero Academia, which was previously aired on defunct channel Yey! (ABS-CBN TV Plus). In October 2023, TV5 President Guido Zaballero announced that the broadcast of the PBA games would be transferred to A2Z, with the change in TV5's programming to focus more on entertainment and news programs. TV5 programs are not only accessible in the Philippines but also have international reach through Kapatid Channel. The network's programs can be viewed in various regions, including Guam, the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, Canada, and the United States. This allows a broader audience to enjoy TV5's content beyond the borders of the Philippines. "Republic Act 2945". June 19, 1960. Archived from the original on April 12, 2023. Retrieved March 5, 2020.
