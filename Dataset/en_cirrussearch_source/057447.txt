Ülker was founded in 1944 by Sabri and Asim Ülker, two brothers whose parents immigrated to Turkey from Crimea, commencing operations in Istanbul as a small bakery. A factory was opened in 1948. Ülker expanded in the 1970s to exporting to the Middle East market, chocolate manufacturing, and packaging. By the end of the 20th century, Ülker was manufacturing margarine, vegetable oil, and dairy products. In 2002, Ülker diversified into carbonated beverages and in 2003 added Turkish coffee, ice cream, and baby food to its product range.[citation needed] In 2003 it introduced Cola Turka, a competitor to Coca Cola. The advertisement of Cola Turka featured actor Chevy Chase, and according to local sources Coca-Cola cut 10% off its prices due to the success of the Cola Turka launch.
