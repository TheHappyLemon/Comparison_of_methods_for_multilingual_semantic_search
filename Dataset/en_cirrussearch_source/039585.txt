Unhošť is a town in Kladno District in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 5,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone. Unhošť is located about 6 kilometres (4 mi) south of Kladno and 13 km (8 mi) west of Prague. It lies mostly in the Křivoklát Highlands, the eastern part of the municipal territory lies in the Prague Plateau. The highest point is at 415 m (1,362 ft) above sea level. The Černý Brook springs here and supplies a system of ponds. The first written mention of Unhošť is from 1284. In 1329, it was referred to as a market town belonging to the Křivoklát estate. In 1489, King Vladislaus II granted Unhošť various privileges and thus accelerated its development. The development was interrupted by the Thirty Years' War, during which the market town was captured twice. Between 1783 and 1790, Unhošť was promoted to a town. The D6 motorway runs north of the town. The Church of Saints Peter and Paul is the landmark of the historic centre and the oldest monument in the town. Originally a Gothic building, it was built in the 14th century and first documented in 1329. At the beginning of the 18th century, the church was rebuilt into its current Baroque form.
