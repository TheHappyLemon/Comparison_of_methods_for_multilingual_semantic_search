Pedro Pablo Hern√°ndez (born 24 October 1986) is an Argentine-born Chilean professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for San Mart√≠n de Tucum√°n. Born in Tucum√°n, Hern√°ndez moved to Buenos Aires at early age, and subsequently joined Racing Club's youth setup. He was released in 2005, aged 19, and returned to his hometown. After failing in a trial at San Mart√≠n de Tucum√°n, Hern√°ndez moved to Atl√©tico Tucum√°n. He made his senior debuts in 2006, and moved abroad two years later, joining Racing Montevideo. On 7 August 2009 Hern√°ndez moved to Defensor Sporting. He made his debut on the 23rd, starting in a 5‚Äì1 home routing over Atenas de San Carlos, and scored his first goal roughly a month later, netting the last of a 4‚Äì0 win at Central Espa√±ol. On 1 July 2010, D.C. United officially announced the loan signing of Hern√°ndez from Uruguayan club Defensor Sporting, after he trialed with the club. Despite being a regular starter for DC United, he rescinded his link on 7 January of the following year, and moved to Argentinos Juniors late in the month. In July 2013 Hern√°ndez joined O'Higgins, as a replacement for Universidad de Chile-bound Juan Rodrigo Rojas. He was a part of the side which won the campaign's Apertura tournament, scoring seven goals in 18 matches, including the historical goal in the final against Universidad Cat√≥lica. Hern√°ndez appeared with the side in 2014 Copa Libertadores, appearing in all matches as his side were knocked out in the group stages. On 26 June 2014, Hern√°ndez moved teams and countries again, after agreeing to a four-year deal with La Liga side Celta de Vigo, for an ‚Ç¨ 1.6 million fee. He made his debut for the club on 30 August, replacing Nolito in the 85th minute of a 1‚Äì1 away draw against C√≥rdoba CF.

On 4 July 2018, Hern√°ndez returned to his natal Argentina and signed with Independiente. In July 2021, Hern√°ndez returned to Chilean side O'Higgins after ending his contract with Independiente. After two and a half seasons with them, he retired from professional football at the end of the 2023 season. In 2024, he returned to professional football by signing with San Mart√≠n de Tucum√°n in his city of birth. Since Hern√°ndez has Chilean Citizenship through Jus sanguinis principles in December 2013, he is eligible to play for Chile. Hern√°ndez was born in Argentina and is an Argentine citizen; he thus had the choice of either playing for Chile or Argentina. When asked about his choice in a 2013 interview, he stated: I feel Chilean largely. During my first year I lived with my grandmother. I have a great affection despite the short time I've been in Rancagua. It was up the possibility for blood right and thank God, yesterday (Tuesday), I received my documents formalizing and dual nationality. ‚Äî‚ÄäHern√°ndez speaking about his switch of allegiance. He then was called up by Jorge Sampaoli to represent his new country's main squad in a friendly against Costa Rica. He made his international debut on 22 January 2014, scoring the second and third in a 4‚Äì0 win at the Estadio Municipal Francisco S√°nchez Rumoroso. In June 2014, Hern√°ndez was called up to the provisional 30-men squad for the World Cup in Brazil, however an injury ruled him out of the final squad. He was re-called to play in the friendly match against Bolivia on 14 October 2014, where he was victim of a penalty that Arturo Vidal changed for goal and the final 2‚Äì2.
