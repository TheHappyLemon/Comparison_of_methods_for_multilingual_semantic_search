After spending the 2019–20 season with Jukurit in the Finnish Liiga, posting 7 goals and 15 points in 39 games, Dzierkals opted to return to his native Latvia by agreeing to a second tenure with Dinamo Riga with a one-year contract on 28 July 2020. He represented Latvia at the 2017 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and the 2019 IIHF World Championship. He represented Latvia at the 2023 IIHF World Championship where he recorded two goals and three assists and won a bronze medal, Latvia's first ever IIHF World Championship medal.
