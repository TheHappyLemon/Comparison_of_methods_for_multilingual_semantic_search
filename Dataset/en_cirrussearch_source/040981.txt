He started the match and played 65 minutes before being substituted in a 1–0 victory. Three days later he made his Ligue 1 debut, starting in a 1–2 defeat at Lorient. Kurzawa played four more league matches, all of them starts, as the season ended with relegation to Ligue 2; he was sent off on 1 May 2011 in a 1–1 draw at Saint-Étienne. He made four appearances as they returned to the top flight at the first attempt as champions.[citation needed] Kurzawa established himself in the first team for the 2013–14 season, with 28 league appearances as Monaco finished runner-up to Paris Saint-Germain. He also scored five goals, the first of his professional career confirming a 2–0 win at Guingamp on 14 December 2013. He scored in each leg of Monaco's 7–1 aggregate win over Young Boys in the third qualifying round of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League.

He scored his first goal for the team from the capital on 25 October, opening a 4–1 home win over Saint-Étienne when set up by Marco Verratti.

On 31 October 2017, Kurzawa scored his first career hat-trick against Anderlecht in the Champions League group phase. Kurzawa became the first defender in modern Champions League history to achieve this feat in the competition. On 29 June 2020, Kurzawa signed a four-year contract extension with Paris Saint-Germain.

On 14 October 2014, during the final leg of the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification play-offs against Sweden, Kurzawa celebrated a goal for France by mocking the Swedish players with a salute.

On 14 November 2014, he made his full international debut, replacing Lucas Digne for the last 20 minutes of a 1–1 friendly draw with Albania in Rennes. Four days later, he made his first start, in a 1–0 friendly win over Sweden in Marseille, being substituted later on for Digne.
