The rivers in the northwest and in the west of the district drain into the Velikaya River, which belongs to the Narva River basin. The source of the Velikaya is located in the district as well. The major part of the area of the district belongs to the drainage basin of the Lovat, which is a tributary of Lake Ilmen and belongs to the Neva basin. The main rivers in the district which belong to the drainage basin of the Lovat are the Nasva and the Smerdel. 31.2% of the area of the district is covered by forests. In the 19th century, the area was split between Velikoluksky Uyezd of Pskov Governorate and Nevelsky Uyezd of Vitebsk Governorate. Novosokolniki was founded in 1901 as a station of the railway which connected Moscow and Riga. It was granted town status in 1925. After 1919, Vitebsk Governorate was a part of Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In 1924, Vitebsk Governorate was abolished, and Nevelsky Uyezd was transferred to Pskov Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Novosokolnichesky District was established, with the administrative center in the town of Novosokolniki. It included parts of former Velikoluksky and Nevelsky Uyezds. Pskov Governorate was abolished as well, and the district became a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On June 17, 1929, the district was transferred to Western Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935, the district was transferred to Kalinin Oblast, and on February 5 of the same year, Novosokolnichesky District became a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Kalinin Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. On May 4, 1938, the district was subordinated directly to the oblast. Between 1941 and 1944, Novosokolnichesky District was occupied by German troops. On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished, and Novosokolnichesky District was transferred to Pskov Oblast. On August 1, 1927 Rykovsky District with the administrative center in the selo of Skokovo was also created. It included parts of former Velikoluksky and Opochetsky Uyezds. The district was a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On June 17, 1929 the district was transferred to Western Oblast. On September 20, 1930, Rykovsky District was abolished and split between Nasvinsky, Loknyansky, Novosokolnichesky, and Pustoshkinsky Districts.
