There was a settlement on land at the confluence of the Tmaka River and Volga Rivers in the 9th and 10th centuries. A fortress was built on the site much later, during the fighting between the Rostov-Suzdal princes and the Novgorod Republic. From the 13th to 15th centuries, the area was part of the Principality of Tver, which competed with Moscow for supremacy in Russia. In the 18th century, Tver became an administrative center; at first, it was part of Saint Petersburg Governorate (1708–1727), and then, of Novgorod Governorate. In 1775, the Tver Viceroyalty was formed; in 1796, it was transformed into Tver Governorate. In September 1929, Tver became the administrative center of Tver District of Moscow Oblast in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR). In November 1931, the city of Tver was renamed Kalinin. On 29 January 1935, Kalinin Oblast was formed from parts of Western, Leningrad and Moscow Oblasts. Germany occupied part of this area from 1941 to 1943 during World War II. On 17 July 1990, by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, the Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast. On 21 April 1992, the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia approved the decision of the presidium of the parliament to rename the region, amending Art. 71 of the Constitution of the Russian SFSR of 1978, which entered into force on May 16, 1992.

This agreement would be abolished on 19 February 2002. On August 23, 2023, a private jet carrying Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner Group leader, crashed in the region.
