Bombyx is the genus of true silk moths or mulberry silk moths of the family Bombycidae, also known as silkworms, which are the larvae or caterpillars of silk moths. The genus was erected as a subgenus by Carl Linnaeus in his 10th edition of Systema Naturae (1758). Bombyx horsfieldi (Moore, 1860) Bombyx huttoni Westwood, 1847 Bombyx incomposita van Eecke, 1929 Bombyx lemeepauli Lemée, 1950 Bombyx mandarina (Moore, 1872) – wild silk moth Bombyx mori (Linnaeus, 1758) – domestic silk moth Bombyx rotundapex Miyata & Kishida, 1990 Bombyx shini Park and Sohn, 2002 Two instances of semi-natural hybridisation are known within this genus:[citation needed] Bombyx hybrid, a hybrid between a male B. mandarina and a female B. mori Bombyx second hybrid, a hybrid between a male B. mori and a female B. mandarina The caterpillars feed on Moraceae, especially on mulberries (Morus species). Domestic silkworms may be fed artificial mulberry chow. Wikispecies has information related to Bombyx. Pitkin, Brian & Jenkins, Paul (November 5, 2004). "Bombyx Linnaeus, 1758".
