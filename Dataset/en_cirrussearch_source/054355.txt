In the following season (2005–06) Ried achieved their highest league finish so far, fourth, in the Bundesliga. The year after they managed to improve once more finishing second and becoming vice-champion. After the first third of the season, the team seemed to battle against relegation and was stuck in the last place for five game weeks. The club management however kept trusting in Helmut Kraft's coaching abilities, which would turn out to be the right decision after all.
