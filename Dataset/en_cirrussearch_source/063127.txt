The 2022–23 La Liga, also known as La Liga Santander due to sponsorship reasons, was the 92nd season of La Liga, Spain's premier football competition. It commenced on 12 August 2022 and concluded on 4 June 2023. Real Madrid were the defending champions, having won their 35th title the previous season. On 14 May, Barcelona were confirmed as champions with four matches to spare following a 4–2 away victory against Espanyol, clinching the club's 27th league title and first since the 2018–19 season. With the 2022 FIFA World Cup having commenced on 20 November, there was a mid-season hiatus in the league. The last round before the break was held from 8–10 November, with the league resuming on 29 December. This season was the first since 2012–13 to conclude in June. A total of twenty teams contested the league, including seventeen sides from the 2021–22 season and three promoted from the 2021–22 Segunda División. This included the two top teams from the Segunda División, and the winners of the promotion play-offs. Teams relegated to Segunda División The first team to be relegated from La Liga were Levante, after a 6–0 loss to Real Madrid on 12 May 2022, ending their five-year stay in the top tier. The second team to be relegated was Alavés, after a defeat of 1–3 by Levante on 15 May 2022, ending their six-year stay in the top tier. The third and final team relegated to Segunda was Granada, who drew against Espanyol, which was coupled with wins of Cádiz and Mallorca on 22 May 2022, the final match day. Granada ended a three-year stay in the top level. Teams promoted from Segunda División The first two teams to earn promotion from Segunda División were Almería and Real Valladolid, who mathematically secured first and second positions, respectively, on the very last match day of the season. Almería returned to La Liga after a seven-year absence, while Valladolid came back after one year. The third and final team to be promoted were Girona after winning the play-off final 3–1 against Tenerife, returning after a three-year absence.
