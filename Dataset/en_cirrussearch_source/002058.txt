28 (twenty-eight) is the natural number following 27 and preceding 29. It is a composite number; a square-prime, of the form (p2,q) where q is a higher prime. It is the third of this form and of the specific form (22.q), with proper divisors being 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. Twenty-eight is the second perfect number - it is the sum of its proper divisors: 1+2+4+7+14=28{\displaystyle 1+2+4+7+14=28}. As a perfect number, it is related to the Mersenne prime 7, since 23−1×(23−1)=28{\displaystyle 2^{3-1}\times (2^{3}-1)=28}. The next perfect number is 496, the previous being 6. Though perfect, 28 is not the aliquot sum of any other number other than itself, and so; unusually, is not part of a multi-number aliquot sequence. The next perfect number is 496. Twenty-eight is the sum of the totient function for the first nine integers. Since the greatest prime factor of 282+1=785{\displaystyle 28^{2}+1=785} is 157, which is more than 28 twice, 28 is a Størmer number. Twenty-eight is a harmonic divisor number, a happy number, a triangular number, a hexagonal number, a Leyland number of the second kind and a centered nonagonal number. It appears in the Padovan sequence, preceded by the terms 12, 16, 21 (it is the sum of the first two of these). It is also a Keith number, because it recurs in a Fibonacci-like sequence started from its decimal digits: 2, 8, 10, 18, 28... There are twenty-eight convex uniform honeycombs. Twenty-eight is the only positive integer that has a unique Kayles nim-value. Twenty-eight is the only known number that can be expressed as a sum of the first nonnegative (or positive) integers (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7{\displaystyle 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7}), a sum of the first primes (2+3+5+7+11{\displaystyle 2+3+5+7+11}) and a sum of the first nonprimes (1+4+6+8+9{\displaystyle 1+4+6+8+9}), and it is unlikely that any other number has this property. There are twenty-eight oriented diffeomorphism classes of manifolds homeomorphic to the 7-sphere.[citation needed] There are 28 elements of the cuboid: 8 vertices, 12 edges, 6 faces, 2 3-dimensional elements (interior and exterior). There are 28 non-equivalent ways of expressing 1000 as the sum of two prime numbers The cube of 12 (1728 = 123) contains a total of twenty-eight divisors (the third-smallest number after 1344 and 960, and preceding 2112). 28 is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of four nonzero squares in (at least) three ways: 52+12+12+12{\displaystyle 5^{2}+1^{2}+1^{2}+1^{2}}, 42+22+22+22{\displaystyle 4^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}} or 32+32+32+12{\displaystyle 3^{2}+3^{2}+3^{2}+1^{2}} (see image).

The number of days in the shortest month of the Gregorian calendar, February in common years. All twelve months of the Gregorian calendar have at least 28 days, regardless of the year. The Gregorian calendar follows a 28-year cycle for the most part, since there are seven days in a week and leap year generally occurs every four years; usually, a calendar from any year is the same as that from 28 years earlier (e.g., 1992 and 2020 or 1994 and 2022). However, that rule holds only when there have been exactly seven leap days in a 28-year interval; years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are common years. Indeed, 1900 (as well as 2100, 2200, etc.) does not use the same calendar as 1872 (2072, 2172, etc., respectively) for the simple reason that 1900 is a common year. In 28 years, any day-of-the-week and date combination occurs exactly four times. February 29 will fall on each day of the week once. In Jewish tradition there is a 28-year solar cycle in which the sun returns to its place in Creation every 28 solar years.

Thus, the number 28 has special significance in the culture of religious sects such as the Kadiri and the Mevlevi dervishes. The 28-beat metric pattern often used in the music compositions accompanying the main part of the Mevlevi sema ritual is called the "Devri kebir", meaning the "Big Circle" and is a reference to above astronomical facts about the year and the Saturn year.
