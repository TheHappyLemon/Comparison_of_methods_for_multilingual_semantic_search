Saue Manor (German: Friedrichshof) traces its origins to at least the 17th century. The current building was erected when the estate was owned by Friedrich Hermann von Fersen. The architect was very probably Johann Schultz, who was also the architect behind the baroque extension of Toompea Castle, Tallinn. The manor house complex is one of the finest examples of baroque manor house architecture in Estonia. The exterior of the main house is characterised by a ground storey with rustications and a pilastered main floor. Wings (a stable-coach house and a granary) are linked to the main building via arched walls. The remains of a baroque park surrounds the manor, with noteworthy details such as sculptures of Heracles and Hera, and baroque sculptured reliefs. The interior is noteworthy for its very rich display of stucco decorations of high quality in late baroque-early neoclassicist style. Stucco decorations adorn all the main rooms of the manor. Additionally, there are fine baroque cocklestoves in the manor. Ingemar Teever (born 1983), football player Valdade rahvastik. 1. III 1934 rahvaloenduse andmed. Vihk I.
