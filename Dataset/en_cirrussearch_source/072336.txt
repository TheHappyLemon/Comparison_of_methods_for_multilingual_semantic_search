Harpalyke /hɑːrˈpæləkiː/, also known as Jupiter XXII, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000 J 5. In August 2003, the moon was named after Harpalyke, the incestuous daughter of Clymenus, who in some accounts was also a lover of Zeus (Jupiter). Harpalyke belongs to the Ananke group, believed to be the remnants of a break-up of a captured heliocentric asteroid. It is about 4 kilometres in diameter and appears grey (color index R-V=0.43), similar to C-type asteroids. The satellite orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 21,064,000 km in 634.19 days, at an inclination of 147° to the ecliptic (147° to Jupiter's equator) with an eccentricity of 0.2441.
