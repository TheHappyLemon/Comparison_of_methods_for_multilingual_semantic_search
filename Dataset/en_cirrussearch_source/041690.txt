Ali Maâloul (Arabic: عَلِيّ مَعْلُول; born 1 January 1990) is a Tunisian professional footballer who plays as a left-back for Egyptian Premier League club Al Ahly and the Tunisia national team. Maâloul started his career with hometown club CS Sfaxien and became their captain from the 2014–15 season. In the 2015–16 season, he became the top scorer in the league with 14 goals in 20 matches, a record for a defender since none has scored more than nine goals in a season.
