Linus Ullmark (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈliːnus ˈulmɑːrk]; born 31 July 1993) is a Swedish professional ice hockey goaltender for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected by the Buffalo Sabres in the sixth round, 163rd overall, of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. With the Bruins during the 2022–23 season, Ullmark led the NHL in wins, goals against average, and save percentage, scored an empty net goal, and won both the William M. Jennings Trophy and Vezina Trophy, the former being shared with his teammate Jeremy Swayman. On 27 May 2014, Ullmark was signed by the Buffalo Sabres to a three-year, entry-level contract. He was returned on loan to Modo Hockey of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) for the 2014–15 season. In his first season in North America, Ullmark attended the Sabres' training camp. After recovery from an early injury, he was assigned to begin the 2015–16 season with the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League (AHL). Ullmark played in three games before being recalled to the Sabres on 23 October 2015. He made his NHL debut the following day, making 24 saves in a 4–3 defeat to the New Jersey Devils. His first victory came in his second start, a 3–1 win over the Philadelphia Flyers. Ullmark would spend majority of the subsequent season with the Americans, amassing a record of 26–27–2. He appeared in one game for the Sabres, falling 4–2 to the Tampa Bay Lightning. On 13 June 2017, the Sabres re-signed Ullmark to a two-year, $1.5 million contract with an annual average of $750,000. Ullmark joined the Sabres full-time during the 2018–19 season. In his season debut on 13 October, he recorded his first career NHL shutout, stopping all 36 shots faced in a 3–0 win over the Arizona Coyotes. On 22 December, Ullmark stopped all 40 shots faced to shut out the Anaheim Ducks 3–0. Overall, he recorded a 15–14–5 record in 37 games while backing up Carter Hutton. On 3 August 2019, the Sabres re-signed Ullmark to a one-year, $1.325 million contract. On 25 October 2020, Ullmark signed a one-year, $2.6 million contract with the Sabres. On 28 July 2021, Ullmark left the Sabres as a free agent and signed a four-year, $20 million contract to be the starting goaltender with the Boston Bruins. Ullmark played his first regular season game for the Bruins on 22 October 2021, a 4–1 win against the Sabres. The 2022–23 season was a historic one for the Bruins, and for Ullmark, who formed the best goaltending tandem in the league with Jeremy Swayman. Ullmark and Swayman's post-victory "goalie hug" embrace became a widely-covered team ritual. Ullmark was named one of three Boston Bruins representatives to the 2023 NHL All–Star Weekend, joining head coach Jim Montgomery and teammate David Pastrňák. Ullmark notched his 100th career win on 19 January, saving 25 of 26 shots against the New York Islanders. On 25 February, he became the thirteenth NHL goaltender to score a goal, and the first since Pekka Rinne in 2020, as he shot the puck directly into the Vancouver Canucks' empty net with less than one minute remaining in the Bruins' 3–1 win. The Bruins finished the regular season with new records in both wins (65) and points (135), winning the Presidents' Trophy. Ullmark and Swayman together received the William M. Jennings Trophy as the goaltending tandem to allow the fewest goals. Their 177 goals against across 82 games was 36 fewer than the second-place Carolina Hurricanes. Ullmark's personal record was 40–6–1 and, he led the NHL in GAA (1.89) and save percentage (.938). He was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender. The Bruins entered the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs as the favourites for the championship. However, they were ousted in the first round by the Florida Panthers, squandering a 3–1 series lead in the process. Much recrimination ensued about Montgomery's coaching decisions, in particular the choice to depart from the team's regular season goalie rotation in favour of playing Ullmark exclusively despite him dealing with an injury. Ullmark was ultimately pulled after Game 6, after he had allowed seven goals in the game. Ullmark defended Montgomery, saying "something that everybody does when things aren't going the way they want to is they're trying to find a scapegoat." Ullmark is a fan of esports, and of Dota 2 in particular. On 18 March 2019, he appeared on a Dota 2 podcast where he discussed the differences between playing Dota and ice hockey, as well as comparisons between the professional scenes of competitive gaming and traditional sports.
