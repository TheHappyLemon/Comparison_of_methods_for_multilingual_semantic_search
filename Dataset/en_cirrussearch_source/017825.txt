It has about 9,900 inhabitants. It is known as a winter sports resort. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone. Villages of Hlinné, Jiříkovice, Maršovice, Olešná, Petrovice, Pohledec, Rokytno, Slavkovice and Studnice are administrative parts of Nové Město na Moravě. The name of the town literally means "New Town in Moravia". Nové Město na Moravě is located about 9 kilometres (6 mi) east of Žďár nad Sázavou and 53 km (33 mi) northwest of Brno. It lies in the Křižanov Highlands, in the highest parts of the whole Bohemian-Moravian Highlands. Most of the municipal territory is located in the Žďárské vrchy Protected Landscape Area. The highest peak in the territory is Kopeček at 822 m (2,697 ft) above sea level. The first written mention of Nové Město na Moravě is from 1267 under the name Bočkov. It was founded during the colonization by royal burgrave Boček of Obřany after the nearby Cistercian monastery in Žďár nad Sázavou was established in 1252, not later than in 1255. The name Nové Město was used for the first time in a deed of King Wenceslaus II from 1293 and it was first referred to as a market town. In 1312, Nové Město was inherited by lords of Lipá. Probably in the late 14th century, they had built a fortress here. In 1496, it was acquired by William II of Pernštejn. During the rule of the Pernštejn family (especially under Vratislav II of Pernštejn in 1561–1582), the town experienced an economic boom. The Renaissance town hall was built and the fortress was rebuilt into a Renaissance castle. The Pernštejn family owned Nové Město until 1588. The next owners were Vilém Dubský, who reconstructed the castle, Archbishop Franz von Dietrichstein, and the Kratzer family, who took care of the economic prosperity of the estate and supported glass making and ironworks in the estate. At the end of the 19th century, skiing developed, thanks to which the town became a centre of winter sports. The railway was built in 1905. The largest employer based in the town is the local hospital. There are only small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. Despite its mountainous location, the town has a long tradition of manufacturing. Among the significant employers are Sporten, producer of ski equipment, and Medin, producer of medical instruments. Other production includes wireless communication modems by Racom. Nové Město na Moravě is a hub of many local roads, crossed by the I/19 road. The town also lies on a local railway line from Tišnov to Žďár nad Sázavou. The town is a prominent Czech winter sports resort. The Vysočina Aréna hosted the 2013 Biathlon World Championships and since the 2011–12 season, the Biathlon World Cup event has been held here more or less regularly. It also hosted events of the Tour de Ski in 2007–08 and 2008–09. Mountain bike races are also being organised in Nové Město na Moravě, hosting races at the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup level as well as the cross-country event of the 2016 UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships. The local football club SFK Vrchovina Nové Město na Moravě plays in the Moravian-Silesian Football League, the third tier of the Czech football system. In the middle of the historic centre is the Vratislavovo Square, named after Vratislav of Pernštejn, where most of the landmarks of the town are located. The elongated square is lined with Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical houses. In the middle of the square is the Church of Saint Cunigunde, the oldest monument in the town.
