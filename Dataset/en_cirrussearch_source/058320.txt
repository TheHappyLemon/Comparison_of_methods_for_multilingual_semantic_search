Sevan Football Club (Armenian: Սևան Ֆորտբոլային Ակումբ), formerly Junior Sevan Football Club, was a football club based in Sevan, Armenia. It was the only football club that represented the Gegharkunik Province of Armenia. Sevan Football Club was founded in 2018 as Junior Sevan Football Club, in the town of Sevan. In its first year of foundation, Junior Sevan applied and took part in the Armenian First League. Even though it won the 2018–19 league season, the club was not granted a license for promotion to the Premier League for not having met the required standards. On 25th of June, 2019, the club announced that the name was changed to Sevan FC. After playing three seasons in the lower Armenian league, they were finally able to get promoted to the premier league by winning the 2020-21 Armenian First League. On 1 December 2021, the Football Federation of Armenia Disciplinary Committee voted in favor to remove Sevan from the Armenian Premier League after they failed to turn up for two games in a row, against Alashkert and BKMA Yerevan. As a result, all of Sevan's results were excluded from the championship table. As of 4 April 2022 Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.
