The 2018 silver medalist, Patrick Roest, qualified for the Olympics as well, but did not skate this distance. The bronze medalist, Kim Min-seok, qualified as well. Nuis was also the world record holder at the start of the Olympics. Thomas Krol is the 2021 World Single Distances champion at the 1500 m distance, with Nuis and Roest being the silver and bronze medalist, respectively. Joey Mantia was leading the 2021–22 ISU Speed Skating World Cup at the 1500 m distance with four races completed before the Olympics, followed by Ning Zhongyan and Connor Howe. Mantia also skated the season best time, 1:41.15 in Salt Lake City on 4 December 2021. The early leader was Ruslan Zakharov in pair 3, overtaken by Marcel Bosker in pair 4.
