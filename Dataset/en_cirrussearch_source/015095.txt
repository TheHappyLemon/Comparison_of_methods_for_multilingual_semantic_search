Romāns Vainšteins (born 3 March 1973, in Talsi) is a former professional road bicycle racer from Latvia. He won the road race at the 2000 World Cycling Championship in Plouay, France. At the end of the 268.8 km (167.0 mi) race, he won the sprint for the line ahead of Zbigniew Spruch and defending champion Óscar Freire. Following his world title, Vainšteins moved to the Domo–Farm Frites–Latexco team under Patrick Lefevere. Even with some impressive results, such as third place in the 2001 Paris–Roubaix, he was unable to follow up on the success of his world championship. He left the team after the 2002 season and raced with Vini Caldirola and Lampre for two more years before retiring. 1995 1st Circuit Franco-Belge 1996 3rd Memorial Van Coningsloo 1998 1st GP Industria & Artigianato di Larciano 1st Grand Prix Aarhus 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 1999 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st Overall Settimana internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 1st Paris–Brussels 1st Grand Prix of Aargau Canton 1st Stage 6 Giro d'Italia Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Stages 1 & 6 1st Gran Premio di Chiasso 2nd Giro del Lago Maggiore 3rd HEW Cyclassics 3rd Coppa Bernocchi 4th Trofeo Melinda 5th Gent–Wevelgem 2000 1st Road race, UCI Road World Championships 1st Coppa Bernocchi 2nd Overall Rheinland-Pfalz Rundfahrt 1st Stages 1 & 2 2nd Overall Three Days of De Panne 2nd Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli 3rd Tour of Flanders 3rd Clásica de San Sebastián 3rd Classic Haribo 4th Amstel Gold Race 4th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 5th Omloop Het Volk 5th Grand Prix of Aargau Canton 6th Overall Ronde van Nederland 9th Milan–San Remo 10th Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Stage 8 10th HEW Cyclassics 10th Züri–Metzgete 2001 1st Stage 3 Volta a Catalunya 1st Stage 6 Tirreno–Adriatico 2nd HEW Cyclassics 3rd Overall UCI Road World Cup 3rd Milan–San Remo 3rd Paris–Roubaix 2002 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships 5th Paris–Tours 2003 1st Stage 4 Giro Della Provincia Di Lucca 2004 5th Grand Prix de Fourmies 7th Milan–San Remo Serisier, Pierre (16 October 2000).
