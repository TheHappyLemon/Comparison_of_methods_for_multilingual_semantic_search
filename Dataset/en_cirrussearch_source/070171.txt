EIRSAT-1 (Educational Irish Research Satellite-1) is a European Space Agency-sponsored 2U CubeSat developed and built by University College Dublin (UCD) in Dublin, Ireland. On 1 December 2023, EIRSAT-1 launched on a Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. Upon reaching orbit, it became Ireland's first satellite. In March 2017, UCD students and professors proposed the satellite to the European Space Agency (ESA) Fly Your Satellite! 2 (FYS 2) educational program for universities. In May 2017, UCD was one of six university teams selected to participate in the ESA FYS2 program. The mission passed its Preliminary Design Review (PDR) with both institutions involved, and following the Critical Design Review (CDR) in 2018, the mission has been developed and implemented by UCD with the support of the ESA Education Office. Lorraine Hanlon, EIRSAT-1 Endorsing Professor, introduced the project during a panel after the Irish premiere of the film "16 Levers de Soleil" on 31 January 2019. The satellite cost €1,500,000 and is funded jointly by the ESA, the Irish Research Council, and Science Foundation Ireland. The mission of EIRSAT-1 is to advance education in space science and engineering across the whole island of Ireland through collaboration between student teams, higher education institutions and high-tech companies. The objectives of EIRSAT-1 are to: develop the know-how of the Irish higher education sector in space science and engineering, by supporting student teams to build, test and operate the satellite; address skills shortages in the space sector by fostering collaboration between student teams and industry through the launch of three payloads that will demonstrate innovative Irish technology; inspire the next generation of students towards the study of STEM subjects by launching the very first Irish satellite. EIRSAT-1 will carry three Irish developed experiments, or payloads. The first payload element (called the ‘Gamma-ray Module’ or ‘GMOD’) is a miniaturised sensor for use in the detection of gamma-rays from both cosmic and atmospheric phenomena. The sensor is called a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) and has been developed by SensL Ltd. in County Cork (currently part of ON Semiconductor). The SiPM has the potential to revolutionise in-situ and remote sensing of gamma-rays in space by removing the need for conventional photomultiplier tubes that are typically very bulky, fragile and require high voltages to operate. The second payload element (called the ‘ENBIO Module’ or ‘EMOD’) will provide in-orbit demonstration of novel protective oxide surface treatments made by ENBIO Ltd. (SolarWhite and SolarBlack). These surface treatments have been developed for use on the ESA Solar Orbiter mission, and EIRSAT-1 will provide the opportunity for these coatings to be thermally tested. The temperature of the coatings will be measured throughout the mission. The third payload is a novel, software-based attitude control system developed by the Dynamics and Control Group in the UCD School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering. A spacecraft's “attitude” is its orientation in space. In this case it will use the Earth's magnetic field to turn itself in any desired direction. The UCD control technique is called “Wave-Based Control” (WBC). EIRSAT-1 will use a standard control system initially. At some time into the mission, in response to an instruction from Earth, the on-board computer will start using WBC to control the satellite's attitude, thereby evaluating its performance and, it is hoped, qualifying WBC for space flight. Subject to successful reviews, the spacecraft was initially scheduled to be launched in 2023 on a Vega-C rocket as part of the Small Satellites Mission Service #5 rideshare mission. However after various delays the CubeSat was remanifested on the maiden flight of the Ariane 6 rocket. This was later changed to a rideshare payload of the South Korean 425 Project SAR satellite launch, which took place at 18:19 UTC on 1 December 2023 on a SpaceX's Falcon 9 Block 5 launch vehicle. The payload was launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit. SpaceX launches Irish, South Korean satellites and lands its 250th rocket Space.com, 2023-12-01.
