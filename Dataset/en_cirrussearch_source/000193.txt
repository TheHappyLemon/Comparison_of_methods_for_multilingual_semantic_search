The CheyTac Intervention also known as the CheyTac M200, is an American bolt-action sniper rifle manufactured by CheyTac USA, which can also be classified as an anti-materiel rifle. It is fed by a seven-round detachable single-stack magazine (an optional five-round magazine is also available). It is specifically chambered in either .408 Chey Tac or .375 Chey Tac ammunition. CheyTac Inc. states that the system is capable of delivering sub-MOA accuracy at ranges of up to 2,500 yd (2,286 m). It is based on the EDM Arms Windrunner. The CheyTac system consists of three major components: .408/.375 CheyTac ammunition CheyTac "XTreme Long Distance™" Rifle CheyTac Advanced Ballistic Computer The CheyTac M200 Intervention is a manually operated, rotating bolt sniper rifle. It features a Picatinny rail on the top of its receiver for mounting various optical sights. The M200 Intervention is chambered in either the .408 CheyTac or .375 CheyTac cartridge. CheyTac specially developed the .408 CheyTac/.375 CheyTac cartridge for long-range use. The cartridge is optimized for accuracy by a balance of the rotational and linear drag, which reduces yaw and precession, and keeps the tip of the projectile pointed along the trajectory. The M200 Intervention is fed through a detachable 7 round box magazine, an optional 5 round box magazine is also available. Alternatively, cartridges can be loaded individually directly into the chamber. The M200 Intervention uses a free floating heavy-fluted barrel, which can be quickly removed for replacement or storage and transportation, and the shroud at the rear serves as a mount for an integral folding bipod and a carrying handle. The M200 Intervention features the McArthur PGRS-1 muzzle brake, which can be used to reduce recoil. The muzzle brake is also removable and can be replaced by an OPSINC suppressor. The M200 Intervention has a collapsible and retractable buttstock that is adjustable for length of pull and for easy storage and transportation. The buttstock also contains an integral rear monopod, which is hinged, and can be folded up when not in use. There are two different day optical sights available for the M200 Intervention. The standard optical sight is the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 variable magnification telescopic sight with a 56 mm objective. The alternative optical sight is the US Optics SN-9. The night vision system is the AN/PVS-14 GEN III Pinnacle monocular, which attaches to the day optic using the Monoloc device. An AN/PEQ-2 infrared laser provides additional lighting in low-light conditions. The device is attached to a titanium strut. The M200 Intervention comes with a portable advanced ballistic computer, laser rangefinder binoculars and meteorological and environmental sensor package. All these components, together with the sniper rifle, are part of the CheyTac Long Range Sniper System (LRSS) and are linked to the ballistic computer. It provides all necessary data and calculations for accurate long range firing. Advanced Ballistic Computer – The CheyTac Advanced Ballistic Computer (ABC) System software package uses tabulated bullet flight data derived from high speed Doppler radar test sessions, and mathematical models to predict ballistic trajectory. It runs on Windows Mobile 2003 and receives input from the Kestrel handheld weather station and Vector IV laser rangefinder binoculars. However, much like other ballistic prediction software, when rounds are used for which no Doppler Radar-established bullet flight data is known, the ABC System relies solely on mathematical ballistic models. Printed data tables are available for manual use. Meteorological and environmental sensor package – The KESTREL 4000 (or, 4500 NV) meteorological and environmental sensor package measures the wind speed, air temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, wind chill, and dew point. The KESTREL 4500 NV model is compatible with night vision devices. Laser rangefinder – The Vector IV mil spec laser rangefinder measures distances up to 6,000 m (6,561.7 yd), and houses a digital compass and class 1 eye safe filters. CheyTac states that "the CheyTac LRRS is a solid anti-personnel system to 2,000 yd (1,829 m)." The primary intent of the .408 is as an extreme range anti-personnel system. Groups of 7 to 9 in (18 to 23 cm) at 1,000 yd (914 m), 10 in (25 cm) at 1,500 yd (1,372 m) and 15 in (38 cm) at 2,000 yd (1,829 m) have been consistently obtained. Groups of 19 in (48 cm) at 2,100 yd (1,920 m) and 29 in (74 cm) at 2,400 yd (2,200 m) have also been obtained. All groups that are up to 3,000 yd (2,743 m) are less than 1 minute of angle for vertical dispersion. The CheyTac Intervention comes in several variants: M200 (29 in (737 mm) barrel length) M200 Carbine (Now out of production) M200 CIV (Civilian Variant) M200 RK[citation needed] M310 (Single shot and repeater sub-variants all with 29 in (737 mm) barrel length) M310 R (Repeater)[citation needed] M325 (Single shot, repeater and tactical sub-variants all with 28 in (711 mm) barrel length) The main capability differences between the different variants are governed by barrel length which determines the obtainable muzzle velocity. Higher muzzle velocity extends the effective range of a rifle, everything else being equal. The M200 and the M200 Carbine are limited to official customers like military forces and come with a detachable box magazine and a telescopic stock, whilst the other variants have a glass-fiber fixed McMillan A5 stock and are available for the general public. The CheyTac M300 Intervention (Carbon Fiber) is a modern rendition of the M200 Intervention. CheyTac utilized lightweight materials such as aluminum and carbon fiber to create a lightweight and portable sniper rifle. The M300 Intervention (Carbon Fiber) can be chambered in either .408 CheyTac or .375 CheyTac cartridge and uses a 7-round detachable box magazine. It has an effective range of 2,500 yd (2,286 m), and a weight of 21 lb (9.5 kg). It features all of the standard features of the M200 Intervention and also features a full-length Picatinny rails at 3, 6, 9 and 12 o’clock positions for mounting various accessories, such as accuracy enhancements, a 29 in (740 mm) fluted barrel (custom lengths are also available), a barrel twist rate of 1:13.25" twist for the .408 CheyTac cartridge and 1:11.25" twist for .375 CheyTac cartridge, a detachable muzzle brake, a fully adjustable folding buttstock that has an adjustable cheek weld, a recoil pad and an optional monopod, an adjustable pistol grip, an adjustable match trigger and flush cups for weapon sling mounting. The CheyTac M300 Intervention (Composite) is a civilian/sporting variant of the M300 Intervention (Carbon Fiber). The M300 Intervention (Composite) can be chambered in either .408 CheyTac or .375 CheyTac cartridge and uses a 7-round detachable box magazine. It has an effective range of 2,500 yd (2,286 m), and a weight of 19 lb (8.6 kg). It features a Picatinny rail on the top of its receiver for mounting various optics/scopes and on the bottom portion of the front end of the handguard for optional bipod mounting, a 29 in (740 mm) fluted barrel (custom lengths are also available), a barrel twist rate of 1:13.25" twist for the .408 CheyTac cartridge and 1:11.25" twist for .375 CheyTac cartridge, a detachable muzzle brake, an adjustable buttstock that has an adjustable cheek weld, V-Block and an optional monopod, an adjustable pistol grip, an adjustable match trigger and flush cups for weapon sling mounting.  Czech Republic: Used by 601st Special Forces Group  Poland: Used by GROM operatives.  Turkey: Used by Maroon Berets operatives.  United Kingdom: Used by the SAS.[better source needed] Accuracy International AX50 "CheyTac USA LLC - Company Profile and News".

This is done by shooting 100 shots, no less than 2 minutes between each shot, correcting for conditions on each shot at 90% of the gun's supersonic range. You count the number of shots within an x MOA diameter. 80% of those shots in an x MOA arc within 90% of supersonic capability gives a REAL MOA value capability for a military grade long range rifle. If 80% of those shots fall within 0.9 MOA, then that is the gun's capability. If humans are shooting the guns, then you should use at least 5 shooters and average the values. Of course, a gun's individual capability should be tested at 200 yd (183 m) to determine if the gun can hold a real group or not. We did this with the .408 in 2001 and 2002. Gives honest numbers, but costs a lot. (statement by Mr. Dean Michaelis, former co-owner and test shooter of CheyTac LLC) "Statistical notes on rifle group patterns by Robert E. Wheeler" (PDF).
