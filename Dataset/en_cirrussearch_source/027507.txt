Wimzie's House is a half-hour Canadian preschool television program produced in Montreal which ran as La Maison de Ouimzie on Télévision de Radio-Canada in the morning and Radio-Québec in late afternoons starting September 4, 1995, and in English on CBC Television starting October 21, 1996 and in the United States on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) from September 1, 1997 to August 31, 2001. Reruns of the show aired in the United States on the Cookie Jar Toons block on This TV, in syndication as part of the Cookie Jar Kids Network block, and on Light TV from December 22, 2016 to September 30, 2019. The series was produced by Cinar (later Cookie Jar Entertainment, now part of WildBrain), with the PBS telecasts presented by Maryland Public Television from 1997 to 2001. The show's puppetry is in the style of Sesame Street, which led to some legal troubles with The Jim Henson Company in 2000 (even though they had some collaboration for some certain children's television shows e.g., Hi Opie!, Dog City, Fraggle Rock, The Hoobs, etc., as well as the same with its production partner, Sesame Workshop, best known for Sesame Park, the Canadian adaptation of Sesame Street). There were two FMV PC games based on the series. Treehouse TV also aired this show in reruns from 1999 to December 2005. Wimzie is a little girl monster who lives with her parents (Rousso & Graziella), grandma (Yaya), and baby brother (Bo). The basic plot was that Wimzie's friends would always come over for the day and they would play together. This usually resulted in a problem and two songs that would eventually lead to the moral of the episode. The cast never expanded beyond the eight main characters. There were some friends and neighbors mentioned, but they never made a real physical appearance. (Voices listed here are for the Canadian English-language version.) Wimzie (performed by Brigitte Brideau and voiced by Sonja Ball) is the protagonist of the series, who is a dragon/bird hybrid with a unique appearance, yellow-orange skin, purple hair tied in pigtails decorated in baby blue bows and red wing-like antlers on the top of her head. She is 5 years old and also introduces each episode in the beginning of the series. In the musical numbers, she performs a few of her solo songs which are titled "When There's a Job to Do", "Turtles", "Be Exactly Who You Are", "Something in My Head" and "I Love You". She has a baby brother named Bo. Rousso (performed by Michel P. Ranger and voiced by Tyrone Benskin) is Wimzie's father. He is a calm tailless dragon with orange skin and blonde hair. He works as a firefighter. When not on the job, Rousso likes to relax. He's a little slow but very kind-hearted. It has been revealed that he has a sister named Alice who is Wimzie's aunt. Graziella (performed by Michel Ledoux, assisted by Helen Evans, voiced by Jennifer Seguin) is Wimzie's mother. She is a bird or platypus like monster (as she has arms—like a platypus—instead of wings) with pink featherless skin and blonde hair in a beehive hairdo. When not on the job, Graziella will spend time with children, often giving them advice. She works as a pilot and is often away from home for extended periods. She has the same voices as Gertie's Mom from The Little Lulu Show, Mrs. Millicent Crosswire (Muffy's Mom) from Arthur, Doris from Caillou and Madeline Gotto in Mona the Vampire. (as both characters are voiced by the same actress) and has a brother named Mario, Wimzie's uncle, who forgot to send Wimzie a binga-boinga on her 5th birthday. Bo (performed by Lucie Beauvais and voiced by Liz MacRae) is Wimzie's baby brother. Being still a baby, he often gets most of Yaya's attention and the others keep tabs on him as well. Unlike Wimzie, he is a full tail-less dragon and not a hybrid like his big sister. He is still learning to talk, so he mostly communicates in gibberish. He is around the age of 12–18 months. Yaya (performed by Johanne Rodrigue, assisted by Grant Mason, voiced by Jane Woods) is Wimzie's maternal grandmother and Graziella's mother. (Like Graziella, she is also a bird or platypus like monster.) She runs a daycare in Wimzie's house for Wimzie and her friends while their parents are working. She has lavender featherless skin and her hair is a stack of orange, blonde and purple. Like Jonas and Loulou, she wears glasses. She occasionally talks to the children (whenever they have a problem) and gives them advice when they need it. Despite her old age, she is full of energy, often being more than a match for a houseful of children, daughter and son-in-law. She also silences everyone during an argument by making a foghorn blowing noise and sound and nobody knows how she does it. She has a bedroom that is only seen in the intro. She has the same voice as Little Lulu Moppet from The Little Lulu Show. Jonas (performed by Andre Meunier, assisted by Jim Kroupa, voiced by Thor Bishopric) is a goblin who is 5 years old and loves science. He collects dirt and has a surprisingly large collection. His skin is green with purple hair and he wears eyeglasses and a propeller cap. Often in his explanations, he would include his catch phrase "It's very scientific." Lou Lou is his little sister. Wimzie possibly has a crush on him. He has the same voice as Jordi from The Secret World of Santa Claus. Loulou (performed by Sylvie Comtois and voiced by Holly Gauthier-Frankel) is Jonas's sister (and a goblin like Jonas). She wants to be like the bigger kids. Yet isn't quite ready to make the jump. She is capable of understanding Bo's baby-jabber. Her complexion is yellow-green and she has the same voice as Sagwa from Sagwa the Chinese Siamese Cat. She wears eyeglasses and has purple hair like her brother, tied in a high ponytail decorated in a bow. Her solo songs are titled "When I'm Scared", "I wanna be Big Right Now", "Left Out" and "What's so good about being big?". Horace (performed by Richard Lalancette and voiced by Bruce Dinsmore) is a troll. He is not as smart as the other kids, but is always asking questions and learning things. He is the strongest of all the children, but angers easily and can sometimes be rough. He gets along best with Bo and his big sister Wimzie. He has the same voice as Binky from Arthur, and Tubby Tompkins from The Little Lulu Show. His skin is light blue and his hair is orange and very straight. He also has a cousin named Morris who looks a lot like him and they are both voiced by the same actor. A running gag throughout the show shows always saying, "Uh/um...question." and then another character would usually respond by saying, "Yes Horace?". The Cookie Crisis (September 4, 1995) Boo!

CINAR and its licensees Eden LLC and Carson-Dellosa Publishing Company denied and continue to deny any wrongdoing or liability for infringement. A confidential settlement allowed CINAR to continue broadcasting the series, selling show merchandise, and a "mechanism for preserving the distinctive look of Jim Henson's Muppets in CINAR's future productions." Ronald A. Weinberg, CINAR President and Co-CEO: We are delighted that it's been settled and that the agreement leaves an open door between the two companies. It's also good news that WIMZIE'S HOUSE will continue to enjoy such a broad audience on PBS in the U.S. and on other channels in over 100 countries around the world. Furthermore, it means that the licensing initiative we launched last year will continue to flourish with both established and new licensee partners.
