The Alosidae, or the shads, are a family of clupeiform fishes. The family currently comprises four genera worldwide, and about 34 species. The shads are pelagic (open water) schooling fish, of which many are anadromous or even landlocked. Several species are of commercial importance, e.g. in the genus Alosa (river herrings), Brevoortia (menhadens), and Sardina. The Alosidae were previously included in the herring family Clupeidae.
