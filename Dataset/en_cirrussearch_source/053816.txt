Auguste Serrurier (25 March 1857 in Denain — 21 March 1921 in Denain) was a French competitor in the sport of archery. Serrurier competed in two events, taking second place in both the Sur la Perche à la Herse and the Sur la Perche à la Pyramide competitions. He is now considered by the International Olympic Committee to have won two silver medals[1]. No scores are known from those competitions, though it is known that Serrurier tied with Emile Druart for second in the à la Herse event, and both are silver medallists.
