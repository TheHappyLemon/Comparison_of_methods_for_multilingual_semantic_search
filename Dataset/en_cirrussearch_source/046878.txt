Sporting Clube Farense, simply known as Farense, is a Portuguese professional football club based in Faro in the district of the same name and the region of Algarve. Founded in 1910, the club will play the 2023–24 season in the Primeira Liga after promotion from the Liga Portugal 2. Founded on 1 April 1910, it became the branch number 2 of Sporting Clube de Portugal (Sporting CP). In its entire history, the club has won nine major trophies: the AF Algarve Championship five times, the Segunda Divisão twice, and the Terceira Divisão and AF Algarve First and Second Divisions once each. Aside from its major trophies, the club as of 2013, has played 23 seasons in the Primeira Liga of which their highest league table classification came in the 1994–95 season where they managed a fifth-place finish. On the back of that best-ever finish, Farense qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time, losing in the first round to Olympique Lyonnais by a single goal in each game. The club also reached the final of the Taça de Portugal in 1990 where they lost to Estrela da Amadora. Among the mainstays of their 1990s teams were the Moroccan attacking duo of Hajry Redouane and Hassan Nader. The 2001–02 season saw the club relegated to the second tier of Portuguese football. In 2006, the club was in the sixth tier, the second district league of the Algarve Football Association, but won two consecutive promotions as champions. In 2012–13 they were promoted to the Segunda Liga. In 2019–20, after the season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the club were promoted back to the top flight after 18 years, under manager Sérgio Vieira. One year later, they were relegated on the final matchday after a 4–0 loss at C.D. Santa Clara. On 3 February 2023, Farense sacked manager Vasco Faísca before a match against Estrela da Amadora, who had cut their advantage in second place to one point. His replacement José Mota led the club back to the Primeira Liga. The Leões de Faro played at the Estádio de São Luís for 94 years from 1910. The club moved stadium in 2004 to the newly constructed Estádio Algarve which was built for the purpose of hosting matches at UEFA Euro 2004. The Faro side moved back to the Estádio de São Luís in 2013 after it gained promotion to the Segunda Liga. As a result of their promotion, the Estádio de São Luís underwent major renovations to improve its facilities. The club has rivalries with fellow Algarve clubs S.C. Olhanense and Portimonense S.C.
