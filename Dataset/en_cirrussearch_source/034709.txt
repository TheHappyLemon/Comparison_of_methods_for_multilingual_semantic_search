Dobele State Gymnasium ((Latvian: Dobeles Valsts ģimnāzija)) is a gymnasium (a pre-university high school) in Dobele, Latvia, founded in 1922. The official language of the school is Latvian, and students can also study English, Russian, and German. Students in grades 10 - 12 concentrate on either Mathematics and Science, Humanities, or Business and Commerce. The Dobele city council, supported by Ministry of Education, decided to open a gymnasium (academically rigorous high school) in Dobele on January 7, 1921. Dobele city gymnasium was established one year later, on March 15, 1922. The first class began with 17 students—10 girls and 7 boys. The school became a cultural sanctuary known throughout the county. On September 26, 2003, Dobele city gymnasium was granted a status change from the Dobele city gymnasium to the Dobele State gymnasium by the President of Latvia Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga. In autumn of 2001, the Latvian Academy of Business and Management and an economics educational organization implemented a commerce program for Dobele students. The school participates in the AFS inter-cultural exchange program and DVG students have studied abroad in many countries around the world, including Denmark, the US, and Scotland. DVG has also received exchange students from Australia, Germany, Austria, Thailand, Brazil, and France. In 2006-2007, the school began a project to highlight teacher's educational process. The project was initiated by teacher L. Čebaņenko, who matriculated two 10th grade classes in a single year. Initially the project was supported by the EU, but after two years it was transferred to the Dobele city council. In the same year, the school was one of 50 schools in Latvia to receive approval for a science program with an emphasis on student research and lab work. DVG students have earned awards in educational competitions at the district, county, national, and international level. DVG has passed down many traditions through the years. These include Knowledge Day, Sports Day, Adaptation Day, Teachers' Day, a Christmas concert, a St. Valentine's ball party, a Spring concert, Environment Day, and School Council sports tournaments including basketball, volleyball, and ice hockey.
