Bree Olson (born October 7, 1986), is an American actress, model, and former pornographic actress. She performed in over 460 pornographic films from 2006 to 2011. Since leaving the adult film industry, she has become critical of the industry for its business practices, and the stigma attached to being a former porn actress. Olson was born in Houston, Texas. Olson's mother and stepfather moved with her to Fort Wayne, Indiana, when she was two years old. Olson entered the pornographic film industry in November 2006, and initially worked for a variety of companies such as Digital Playground, Elegant Angel, and Red Light District Video. She was a contract performer with Adam & Eve from 2007 to 2010. Olson was named Penthouse Pet of the Month for March 2008. In 2010, she was named by Maxim as one of the 12 top female stars in porn.[failed verification] She appeared on the cover of the May 2011 issue of Penthouse, on the cover of the August 2011 Playboy magazine. She retired from shooting pornography in 2011 at the age of 25. Olson appeared on the E! Network reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians in 2007, in which she served as a nanny to daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner when they were children. Olson later told Cosmopolitan that although the show portrayed matriarch Kris Jenner as having hired her from a "reputable agency", she had actually been booked by her agent, relating that during casting, the producers "wanted a super-sexy vixen. Instead they got a cute little girl with blonde hair, like the girl next door. I just looked too wholesome, even in a bikini. I showed up with a baby blue and pink gingham two-piece. I mean...And so they had to spin it, I think, because they wanted me to be super trashy. I think that they thought because of my background that that's just something that comes naturally, but it doesn't to me." Olsen stated that she was cast in order engage in antics such as rummaging through Kris' belongings and sunbathing by the pool while topless, in order to provoke a reaction from family members such as patriarch Bruce Jenner, who was initially uncomfortable with her presence, but became more amenable when the two of them got to know one another. After the producers left the house, Olson was left to babysit them in earnest, spending time with them and getting to know them. Olson subsequently appeared in the independent comedy film Purgatory Comics (2009), co-starred in the horror film The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence) (2015) and appeared in Penn Jillette and Adam Rifkin's Director's Cut (2016).[failed verification] In 2015, she played Divatox in the short, web film Power/Rangers. She has also done a series of videos for Will Ferrell and Adam McKay's website Funny or Die. In February 2011, Olson moved in with actor Charlie Sheen as one of the girlfriends, whom he nicknamed his "goddesses". Her relationship with Sheen ended in April 2011. She later married her wife Kayla, but they divorced in 2021. Olson identifies as a lesbian. In 2016, she described her post-porn social life in The Daily Dot: "Porn didn't hurt me. The way society treats me for having done it does". This article was later followed by her March 25 appearance in the YouTube documentary series Real Women, Real Stories, in which she repeated these statements, adding that she believes society in general perceives former porn stars in a highly negative manner, specifically as morally akin to pedophiles. She is critical of the pornography industry (but not of the profession itself): "We are the only entertainment industry that doesn't offer talent royalties after they are gone." 2007 NightMoves Award – Best New Starlet (Editor's Choice) 2008 AVN Award – Best New Starlet 2008 AVN Award – Best Anal Sex Scene (Video) – Big Wet Asses 10 (with Brandon Iron) 2008 XBIZ Award – New Starlet of the Year 2008 Adam Film World Guide Award – Starlet of the Year 2008 XRCO Award – New Starlet 2008 XRCO Award – Cream Dream 2008 F.A.M.E.
