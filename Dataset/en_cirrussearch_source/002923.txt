Steven Stamkos (born February 7, 1990) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward and captain of the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL). Stamkos was selected first overall in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft by the Lightning. He is a two-time Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy winner as the NHL's leading goal-scorer (2010 and 2012), is a two-time NHL second team All-Star (2011, 2012), and has been named to seven NHL All-Star Games. Nicknamed "Stammer", he has scored the most goals and the most points of any player born in the 1990s decade. Stamkos captained the Lightning to back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 2020 and 2021 as well as appearances in the Stanley Cup Finals in 2015 and 2022. Stamkos is of Macedonian and Scottish descent. He grew up in Unionville, Ontario, and played for the Markham Waxers in the Eastern AAA Hockey League of the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA). During one of his seasons with the North York Canadiens, he was teammates with NHLer P. K. Subban. Stamkos won eight OMHA titles in a row in minor hockey and led his Waxers club to the OHL Cup title in March 2006.[citation needed] He played in the 2003 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Markham Waxers. Stamkos attended Central Park Public School and St. Brother André Catholic High School in Markham, Ontario.[citation needed] After being drafted by the OHL's Sarnia Sting, he attended Northern Collegiate Institute and Vocational School in Sarnia.[citation needed] Following a season with the minor Waxers in which he scored 197 points over 66 games, Stamkos was selected first overall in the 2006 OHL Draft by the Sarnia Sting. Stamkos played with other notable current and former NHLers in his minor and junior hockey career, including Logan Couture, John Tavares, Michael Del Zotto, Cameron Gaunce, Cody Hodgson, and P. K. Subban during his minor hockey career in the Greater Toronto Area.[citation needed] Joining the Sting in 2006–07, he recorded 92 points (42 goals and 50 assists) over 63 games as a junior rookie. He was named to the OHL Second All-Rookie Team, ranking behind Sam Gagner at the center position. Stamkos also won the Bobby Smith Trophy as the OHL's scholastic player of the year for his academic efforts off the ice. The following season, Stamkos improved to 58 goals and 105 points over 61 games. He was named to the OHL second All-Star team, but was later selected to the CHL first All-Star team, which encompasses all three national major junior leagues. Playing in his NHL draft-eligible season in 2007–08, Stamkos was top-ranked throughout the campaign by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau and International Scouting Services. He also won the CHL's Top Draft Prospect Award. As the 2008 NHL Entry Draft approached, Stamkos was largely seen as the best available center. His primary competition for the top overall pick was top prospect defencemen Drew Doughty and Zach Bogosian, as well as Russian winger Nikita Filatov. The Tampa Bay Lightning, by virtue of their previous season in which they won an NHL-worst 31 games, owned the first pick. As expected, Stamkos was selected first overall by Tampa Bay. On July 29, 2008, he signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Lightning in which he could earn as much as $8.55 million in performance bonuses. Leading up to the start of the 2008–09 season, the Lightning centered their promotional efforts around Stamkos, including a website with the slogan "Seen Stamkos?" Stamkos played in his first NHL game on October 4, 2008, in Prague, Czech Republic, at the start of the 2008–09 season. The Lightning fell to the New York Rangers 2–1 and were eventually swept in Prague. He recorded his first point – a secondary assist – in his eighth game, on a goal scored by Vincent Lecavalier which was against his hometown Toronto Maple Leafs. Following the game, Stamkos commented that his hometown support was "louder than when the Leafs scored". He scored his first goal the next game against Ryan Miller of the Buffalo Sabres. After 54 games, Stamkos recorded the first NHL hat-trick of his career, on February 17, 2009. The Lightning held a 3–1 lead midway through the second period on the strength of Stamkos' natural hat-trick, but were still beaten by the visiting Chicago Blackhawks, 5–3. The three goals enabled Stamkos to become the first rookie in Lightning history to score three goals in a game. He also became the second-youngest player in NHL history to record a natural hat-trick; current record-holder Bobby Carpenter was 18 when he scored three on February 25, 1982. Though Stamkos was heavily criticized for his lack of production during the first half of the season, in which he was limited to less than ten minutes of ice time some games (largely due to a dispute amongst then-head coach Barry Melrose and upper management, mainly co-owner Len Barrie on how to approach the development of Stamkos in the NHL), he finished the season with 19 points in his final 20 games. In his rookie season, Stamkos totaled 23 goals, 23 assists and 46 points, as well as a −13 plus-minus rating in 79 games. Prior to the 2009–10 season, Stamkos spent the summer training extensively with newly retired NHL player Gary Roberts, working on adding strength and endurance. Roberts got to know Stamkos in the 2008–09 season, his last in the NHL. He oversaw Stamkos' off-season workouts north of Toronto in Roberts' in-house gym, which is a quick drive from Stamkos' family home in Unionville. Stamkos spoke highly regarding the workouts: "It helped me a lot," Stamkos said. "I learned a lot about what I needed to improve on. There are certain aspects of my game that have improved because of that, and I'll be there again this summer working hard. It definitely gave me that extra jump for this season." In his second year with the Lightning, Stamkos began to find his range as an NHL sharpshooter and had a breakout season. Playing the bulk of the season on a line with Martin St. Louis and Steve Downie, Stamkos started the 2009–10 campaign with 10 goals in his first 11 games. Through the months of January and February, Stamkos had an 18-game point streak. By the time he turned 20, he was in the top five in the NHL in scoring, challenging the likes of generational talents Alexander Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby. On April 10, 2010, Stamkos reached the 50-goal mark for the season when he scored two goals against Tampa Bay's inner-state rival, the Florida Panthers. He ended the season with 51 goals, tied for most in the NHL with Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins; the two shared the Rocket Richard Trophy as the NHL's goal-scoring leaders; he tied Crosby in the final minute of the last game of the season with an empty-net goal. Stamkos became the third-youngest player to score 50 goals in a season, after Wayne Gretzky and Jimmy Carson. His number of goals (51) was five more than his total points amount in the previous season (46). Additionally, Stamkos' 44 assists gave him 95 points for the season, good for fifth place in the NHL behind Henrik Sedin, Alexander Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby and Nicklas Bäckström. However, Tampa Bay finished the year with 34 wins and 80 points, 8 points out of a playoff spot. After the season, the team's poor record prompted team owner Jeffrey Vinik to terminate Brian Lawton and Rick Tocchet's contracts as general manager and head coach, respectively. Following a high-scoring start to the 2010–11 season in which he scored 19 goals in his first 19 games, Stamkos began to attract media attention for challenging the elite "50 goals in 50 games" standard. Wayne Gretzky, who scored 50 goals in a record 39 games in 1981–82, told reporters he thought Stamkos was surrounded by enough talent in Tampa Bay to achieve the feat. Gretzky also followed up by saying "he's got tremendous speed and such a quick release. He understands the game and goes into the holes and gets into the right areas." On December 20, 2010, Stamkos scored his 26th goal of the season and the 100th of his career, leading the Lightning past the Carolina Hurricanes 5–1. Stamkos had one of three Lightning goals late in the second period that put Tampa Bay ahead 5–1. The centre's milestone goal came in his 194th NHL game. In January 2011, Stamkos was named by the NHL to play in the NHL All-Star Game. Stamkos was drafted second overall by Team Lidstrom, joining teammate Martin St. Louis on the squad. However, as the season progressed it became apparent Stamkos would not achieve the 50-in-50 mark. By the 52nd game, he had recorded an NHL-leading 38 goals. Stamkos' latter portion of the season was markedly less successful; he recorded just 7 more goals in the last 30 games. Finishing the 2010–11 season with 45 goals, he ranked second in NHL scoring, only behind Corey Perry of the Anaheim Ducks. He also recorded 46 assists for a new career high in assists and 91 points and played in all 82 games. His 91 points placed him fifth in the NHL for the second consecutive year. Stamkos was named a finalist for the Ted Lindsay Award alongside Corey Perry and Daniel Sedin, which was eventually won by Daniel Sedin. As the Lightning ranked fifth in the Eastern Conference, Stamkos made his Stanley Cup playoff debut in on April 13, 2011, against the Pittsburgh Penguins. On April 23, 2011, he scored his first two career playoff goals, as well an assist, in an 8–2 victory over the Penguins in game five. The Lightning advanced to the second round and swept the top seeded Washington Capitals and eventually the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Bruins. During the deciding Game 7, Stamkos took a slapshot from Bruins defenceman Johnny Boychuk to the face; the impact broke his nose and bloodied his face, forcing him to momentarily leave the game, though he eventually returned wearing a full-caged mask. The Lightning went on to lose the game 1–0 and the series 4–3 after Bruins forward Nathan Horton scored the loan goal in the game to lose the series 4–3, eliminating them from the playoffs, one win short from the Stanley Cup Finals. Stamkos scored below his regular season pace with 13 points (6 goals, 7 assists) over all 18 games, ranking fifth in team-scoring. During the 2011 off-season on July 1, 2011, Stamkos became a restricted free agent. Eighteen days later, he re-signed with Tampa Bay on a five-year, $37.5 million contract. Stamkos was also named alternate captain by the Lightning on September 23, 2011, two weeks before the start of the 2011–12 season. Lightning head coach Guy Boucher quoted Stamkos’ role by saying, “Leaders aren't born; they are made, and you need courage. He has to be a leader and we know it. He wants it. The 2011 playoffs showed that he was ready and he's earned it." On March 13, 2012, Stamkos scored his 50th goal of the season in a 6–1 win over the Boston Bruins. In so doing, he became the sixth player in NHL history to record more than one 50-goal season before his 23rd birthday. He then scored his 53rd goal on March 26 against the Philadelphia Flyers, breaking Vincent Lecavalier's team record for goals in a season, set in 2006–07. Five days later, Stamkos set an NHL record by scoring his fifth overtime goal of the regular season, beating Winnipeg Jets goaltender Ondřej Pavelec from the left circle, Stamkos' "trademark" shot during his first three seasons prior to 2011–12 similar to Washington Capitals captain Alexander Ovechkin. On April 7, 2012, the final day of the season, Stamkos recorded his 60th goal in a 4–3 overtime win against the Winnipeg Jets, becoming the 20th player in NHL history to achieve the feat and the first since Alexander Ovechkin did so in 2007–08. Adding to his 60 goals, Stamkos recorded 37 assists for 97 points and played in all 82 games for the third consecutive season, his 97 points ranked second in the NHL as the runner up for the Art Ross Trophy, 12 behind Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins, who (along with New York Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist) were named the NHL's three finalists for the Hart Memorial Trophy which was eventually awarded to Malkin. Stamkos was also a finalist for the Ted Lindsay Award for the second straight season (which also went to Malkin) and his 60 goals led to him being awarded his second Rocket Richard Trophy. Despite Stamkos' individual success, the Lightning struggled as a team, finishing the season 8 points out of a spot for the 2012 playoffs and at tenth overall in the East. During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Stamkos trained with a handful of other NHL players at Gary Roberts' training academy in Ontario. The lockout also gave Stamkos an opportunity to do things in his hometown of Toronto he normally would not get to do. That included playing in his father's pick-up hockey league every Thursday night, when he and former Lightning forward Steve Downie would mix it up with a group that varied as much in age (22–65) as ability. On playing in his father's pick-up league, Stamkos said, "It was a blast, those guys loved it they don't get a chance to play with NHL guys very often." He added, "It was a lot of fun and something I'll cherish forever." On March 1, 2013, nearly two months after play resumed for the shortened 2012–13 season, Stamkos was named the NHL's First Star of the Month for February. He joined Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby and Chicago goaltender Ray Emery, who ranked as the Second and Third Stars, respectively. Stamkos had a season-high six-game goal streak and six multi-point outings, and recorded at least 1 point in 11 of 14 games last month. He ended February on an eight-game point streak (seven goals and seven assists). On March 18, 2013, Stamkos scored his 200th career goal to give the Lightning the victory over the Philadelphia Flyers. Stamkos finished the season playing in all 48 games with 29 goals, ranking him second in the NHL behind Alexander Ovechkin's NHL-leading 32. He also had 28 assists, which gave him a total of 57 points for the runner up for the Art Ross Trophy for the second straight season behind teammate Martin St. Louis. On November 11, 2013, Stamkos suffered a broken tibia in a game against the Boston Bruins at TD Garden. He was backchecking on a play late in the second period when he was tied up with Boston defenceman Dougie Hamilton. His left skate appeared to hit the post first before his right leg sliding into it around the shin area. He tried to get up twice before going down to the ice in pain, grabbing his leg just above the ankle with the training staff along with teammates Martin St. Louis, Alex Killorn, Victor Hedman, Sami Salo and Ryan Malone (who were on the ice with Stamkos when he slid into the net) rushing to his side. After a brief delay, a stretcher was brought out by the trainers and he was taken off the ice to a loud applause from the audience and the rest of his teammates and the Lightning coaches looking on. He was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital. Stamkos entered the day tied for the NHL's lead in scoring with Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby. On November 12, 2013, Stamkos underwent successful surgery in Boston to stabilize a fracture in his right tibia, and he began rehabilitation immediately. On November 25, 2013, Stamkos made a press appearance where he was seen walking without the use of crutches or a walking boot. He updated the media on his miraculous progress and was hopeful that he could return to the Lightning before commencement of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which he was widely considered to play in for Canada. Ultimately, he was unable to recover in time to participate in the Olympics. However, he was cleared to play for the Lightning on March 5, 2014, the same day former teammate Martin St. Louis was traded to the New York Rangers – and returned March 6, 2014, in a game against the Buffalo Sabres, which the team lost 3–1. Stamkos was named the new captain of the Lightning before the game, replacing the departed St. Louis. Lightning head coach Jon Cooper stated that Stamkos was "destined to be our leader" and his leadership puts the Lightning "one step closer to achieving our ultimate goal in winning a Stanley Cup." On March 24, 2014, Stamkos played in his 400th career NHL game, scoring a power play goal to tie the game at three in an eventual 4–3 shootout loss to the Ottawa Senators. He finished the injury-shortened 2013–14 season playing in 37 games with 25 goals, 15 assists and 40 points. On November 11, 2014, Stamkos recorded his 200th career NHL assist on a goal scored by Nikita Kucherov in a Lightning 3–2 shootout loss to the Chicago Blackhawks at United Center. On December 9, 2014, Stamkos reached another career milestone when he scored his 250th NHL goal. The goal came in a Tampa Bay 5–3 loss to the Washington Capitals against Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby, his 17th of the season. Stamkos finished the 2014–15 season playing in all 82 games and recording 43 goals, 29 assists and 72 points. His 43 goals were once again second overall in the league only behind Washington Capitals captain Alexander Ovechkin who had 53 goals. On May 24, 2015, during Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals of the 2015 playoffs against the Presidents' Trophy-winning New York Rangers, Stamkos scored a goal in a 2–0 Lightning victory over the Rangers on goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, tying him with the Lightning playoff record for goals in consecutive games (4). After the Lightning defeated the Rangers in seven games, Stamkos and the Lightning would move on to the Stanley Cup Finals where they were defeated in six games by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks. On October 12, 2015, Stamkos recorded his 500th career NHL point off a power-play goal against Boston Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask. The Lightning would go on to win the game 6–3. With his 500th career point, Stamkos became the third player in Lightning history to record over 500 points. He joined both Martin St. Louis (953) and Vincent Lecavalier (874) as the only players to do so. On October 23, 2015, Stamkos played in his 500th career NHL game in a 4–3 overtime Lightning victory over the Winnipeg Jets. On November 1, 2015, Stamkos moved into second place for the most power-play goals in Lightning history with 97. Stamkos moved from a tie with former teammate Martin St. Louis, who had 96 power-play goals in his time with the Lightning On January 6, 2016, Stamkos was selected to his fourth All-Star Game, joining teammate Ben Bishop. On February 20, 2016, Stamkos scored his 300th career NHL goal, which came in a 4–2 Lightning win over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Stamkos became the third Lightning player in franchise history to record 300 goals, joining Lecavalier (383) and St. Louis (365). During a post-game interview, Stamkos said of his feat, "[F]irst of all, it means you've been around for a while and secondly, I've been fortunate to play with a lot of good players. I've been able to be put in positions to score goals and obviously it was special coming in a big win for our team." On February 26, 2016, Stamkos played in his 553 game in Lightning history, which came in a 4–0 win over the New Jersey Devils. With the game, Stamkos surpassed Brad Richards (552) for fourth all-time in games played for the Lightning. On February 28, 2016, Stamkos recorded his 245 career assist as a member of the Lightning in a 4–1 over the Boston Bruins on a goal by Ryan Callahan. The assist moved Stamkos past Václav Prospal (244) to become fourth all-time in assists with the Lightning. On April 2, 2016, the Lightning announced Stamkos was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, the same injury that sidelined teammate Andrei Vasilevskiy at the start of the 2015–16 season; it is a condition that is rare among hockey players. Stamkos said he first felt some discomfort in his arm after the game against the Montreal Canadiens on March 31, 2016. He was scheduled for surgery on the following Monday with Dr. Karl Illig, who performed Vasilevskiy's surgery. Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman said there would be no long-term impact on Stamkos' health or his career. In addition, Yzerman indicated Stamkos recovery time would be between one and three months, but the club would have a better idea in a couple of weeks where he falls within that time frame. Yzerman also said the team's desire is for Stamkos to remain with the organization, which came after a question of whether Stamkos had played his last game in a Lightning uniform. On April 4, 2016, Stamkos had successful surgery at Tampa General Hospital. Stamkos' surgeon said they plan on evaluating him in approximately two weeks and that should clear up his prognosis. On May 26, 2016, Stamkos dressed for Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins, despite still being on blood thinners following surgery. He registered five shot attempts during the game, but the Lightning lost the game 2–1 for a 4-3 defeat in the series and were eliminated from the playoffs, 1 win short from back to back Stanley Cup Finals. On June 29, 2016, two days before Stamkos was set to become an unrestricted free agent, the Lightning signed him to an eight-year, $68 million contract extension with an annual average value of $8.5 million. Stamkos played in 77 games with the Lightning the previous season, scoring 36 goals, 28 assists and 64 points, ranking first in goals, third in assists and second in points for the team. General manager Steve Yzerman said of the signing, "[W]e are very appreciative of the effort and commitment that Steven and his representatives have exhibited in getting a deal done." He continued, "We are excited to have him as a cornerstone part of the team for the next eight years as we continue in the franchise's ultimate goal of winning another Stanley Cup." On November 15, 2016, 17 games into the 2016–17 season, Stamkos fell and left the game against the Detroit Red Wings at Joe Louis Arena, which turned out to be a torn lateral meniscus in his right knee. Steve Yzerman said there was no timetable for his return and that Stamkos would be out "indefinitely". On November 17, 2016, Stamkos headed to Vail, Colorado, to undergo arthroscopic knee surgery to repair a lateral meniscus tear The procedure he underwent was estimated to have a four-month recovery window, which would keep Stamkos out of the lineup until at least mid-March. This could translate into Stamkos missing at least 50 games. Later in the day, the Lightning announced Stamkos underwent surgery that day. As predicted, Stamkos was expected to miss approximately four months. On February 20, 2017, Yzerman provided an update on Stamkos' rehabilitation progress. Yzerman said that Stamkos had begun light skating, and is progressing well. Yzerman further stated that the timeline was still four to six months for his recovery. Stamkos would be approaching the four-month recovery window in mid-March. If Stamkos needs the full six months, he would be out for the remainder of the season. On March 29, 2017, Lightning head coach, Jon Cooper, said that after the team's upcoming game against the Detroit Red Wings Stamkos would be considered day-to-day. Stamkos said that he was not going to put any dates on his return, however, he did say that he was very pleased and excited with how his knee was feeling. Stamkos did not return to the lineup for the Lightning that season and the Lightning missed the 2017 playoffs by just 1 point in the standings. On October 6, 2017, Stamkos played in his first game since injuring his knee the prior season in November 2016. Stamkos recorded 2 assists in his return on goals by Nikita Kucherov and Vladislav Namestnikov respectively, which resulted in a 5–3 Lightning win over the visiting Florida Panthers. On October 12, 2017, Stamkos scored his 112th power play goal, which tied him with Vincent Lecavalier for the most power play goals in franchise history. On October 21, 2017, Stamkos scored his 113 power play goal, against Antti Niemi of the Pittsburgh Penguins in a 7–1 Lightning win at the Amalie Arena. The goal moved Stamkos past Lecavalier for most power play goals in franchise history. During that game, Stamkos also recorded his 600th career NHL point with an assist on a goal by Mikhail Sergachev. On October 26, Stamkos recorded a point in his 11th consecutive game to start the season. In so doing, Stamkos tied Martin St. Louis for the longest season-opening point streak in Lightning history. Stamkos' streak ended the following game. On November 2, 2017, Stamkos skated in his 600th career NHL game against the New York Rangers. The following day, Stamkos was fined $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct after spraying his water bottle at a referee during the previous night's game. On November 17, 2017, Stamkos scored four points in a 6–1 Lightning win over the visiting Dallas Stars. This was Stamkos' fourth four-point game, which tied Stamkos with Martin St. Louis and Vincent Lecavalier for the most four-point games in Lightning history. On January 3, 2018, Stamkos was voted by fans to be the Atlantic Division captain at the 2018 National Hockey League All-Star Game, which was held at the Lightning's home arena, Amalie Arena. This was Stamkos' fifth NHL All-Star Game appearance, which moved him past Vincent Lecavalier for second most NHL All-Star Game appearances by a Lightning player. On January 25, 2018, Stamkos recorded his 300th career NHL assist on a goal by Vladislav Namestnikov. The milestone came in a 5–1 Lightning victory over the Philadelphia Flyers away at Wells Fargo Center. On February 8, 2018, Stamkos recorded his 20th goal of the season, which came in a 5–2 win over the visiting Vancouver Canucks. This was Stamkos' ninth 20-goal season in franchise history, which tied him with Martin St. Louis for second-most such seasons in franchise history. On March 3, 2018, Stamkos set a new career high with a five-point game in a 7–6 Lightning shootout win over the visiting Philadelphia Flyers. Stamkos became the seventh Lightning player in franchise history to score five points in one game. The five-point game also gave Stamkos the most career regular season games scoring at least four points in franchise history, with 11. On March 21, 2018, Stamkos was fined $5,000 for a dangerous trip against Toronto Maple Leafs' defenceman Morgan Rielly, which occurred the previous night at Amalie Arena. On March 30, 2018, Stamkos appeared in his 663rd career NHL game, which moved him past Pavel Kubina for third-most games played in Lightning history. He ended the 2017–18 season playing in 78 games with 27 goals, 59 assists and 86 points recorded. His 59 assists was a new career high. On May 17, 2018 during game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Stamkos recorded his 11th career NHL playoff power-play goal in a 4–2 Lightning win over the Washington Capitals at Capital One Arena against Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby. The goal moved Stamkos past St. Louis for most playoff power-play goals in franchise history. The Lightning would eventually go on to lose the series in seven games, coming one win short from the Stanley Cup Finals. On October 18, 2018, Stamkos recorded his 50th career game-winning goal in a 3–1 Lightning victory over the visiting Detroit Red Wings. In so doing, Stamkos became the third player in franchise history to record at least 50 game-winning goals, joining Vincent Lecavalier (60) and Martin St. Louis (64). On December 10, 2018, Stamkos scored a power play goal on New York Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist to record his 700th career NHL point. He became the third player in franchise history to reach 700 career points. Stamkos was also the first player from the 2008 NHL Entry Draft to record 700 career points. That same night, Stamkos also recorded his ninth career NHL hat-trick, in so doing also surpassing Martin St. Louis (8) for most hat-tricks in Lightning history. Stamkos' record breaking night helped the Lightning beat the visiting New York Rangers 6–3. On December 20, 2018, Stamkos played in his 700th career NHL game. He scored in the second period of that game, which moved him past Martin St. Louis for second-most goals in franchise history with 366. The goal came in a 5–4 shootout road win against the Calgary Flames at the Scotiabank Saddledome. For December 2018, Stamkos set the Lightning record for most goals in a single calendar month with 14. On January 2, 2019, Stamkos was named to the 2019 NHL All-Star Game, his sixth All-Star selection, tying him with Martin St. Louis for the most in Lightning history. On March 18, 2019, Stamkos scored the 384th goal of his career against the Arizona Coyotes to break the Lighting team record previously held by Vincent Lecavalier for most regular season goals. Lecavalier said after the game "All the adversity, scoring all over the ice - and still managing to set the record in a relatively small number of games is remarkable and further establishes Stammer as one of the top goal-scorers in the game. It's an honor to call him a friend and a teammate." On March 25, 2019, Stamkos recorded his fifth 40-goal season and his fourth 90-point season. Stamkos tied St. Louis for the most 90-point seasons in Lightning history. On April 4, 2019, Stamkos recorded a goal against Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender Frederik Andersen and an assist on a goal by Alex Killorn giving him 97 points on the year to match his highest point total in a single season. The goal also established a new franchise record for most consecutive road games with a goal (7). In the season finale on April 6, 2019, Stamkos recorded a short-handed goal against Boston Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask to extend his road goal record to 8-games and also set a new career high in points with his 98th point. Stamkos finished the 2018–19 season recording 45 goals, 53 assists and a career high 98 points and played in all 82 games to help the Lightning win their first Presidents' Trophy as the regular season champions. His 45 goals lead his team in goals and 53 assists and 98 points for second on his team. His 45 goals also was good enough for fourth in the NHL overall only behind Toronto Maple Leafs forward John Tavares who completed with 47 goals, Edmonton Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl who ended with 50 goals and Washington Capitals forward and captain Alexander Ovechkin who recorded a league leading 51 goals. On November 16, 2019, Stamkos recorded his 400th career NHL goal on goaltender Connor Hellebuyck in a 4–3 loss to the Winnipeg Jets at Amalie Arena. Stamkos became the first player in Lightning history to score 400 goals with the franchise. On December 7, 2019, Stamkos recorded his 150th and 151st NHL power-play goal in a 7–1 Lightning win over the visiting San Jose Sharks at Amalie Arena. In doing so, Stamkos became the fourth player in NHL history that played primarily as a center to record 150+ career power-play goals before the age of 30. On December 28, 2019, Stamkos recorded his 800th career NHL point by scoring a goal on Carey Price of the Montreal Canadiens. Stamkos became the third player in Lightning history to record 800 points with the franchise. On January 9, 2020, Stamkos recorded his 400th career NHL assist on a Nikita Kucherov goal against the Arizona Coyotes, becoming the third player in Lightning history to reach the milestone. On January 24, 2020, Stamkos was named to the NHL's 2010s All-Decade Second Team. In that decade Stamkos recorded 731 points over 672 games ands the second most goals (363) only behind the 437 scored by Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals. On February 4, 2020, Stamkos recorded his 61st game-winning goal of his career against Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury. The goal moved him past Vincent Lecavalier for second most game-winning goals in Lightning history. On February 17, 2020, Stamkos skated in his 800th career NHL game against the Colorado Avalanche. Stamkos joined St. Louis and Lecavalier as the only players in franchise history to play in 800 career games. On March 2, 2020, Stamkos had surgery to repair a core muscle. Stamkos recovery was projected at six to eight weeks from the procedure, which caused him to miss the remainder of the regular season. Up to that point in the 2019–20 season, he had played in 57 games and recorded 29 goals and 37 assists adding up to 66 points. The last 12 games of the regular season would eventually get canceled a week later and the playoffs would get postponed to the summer due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 23, 2020, Stamkos returned to the Lightning lineup in the third game of the Stanley Cup Finals where he scored on his first shot of the game on Dallas Stars goaltender Anton Khudobin. Stamkos' goal was the second time in NHL history that a player skating in their first game of the playoffs in the Stanley Cup Finals scored a goal, the previous being Billy Taylor Sr. in 1940. Stamkos logged just 2:47 of ice time during the game which was his only game of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Lightning would go on to win the Stanley Cup against the Stars, marking Stamkos' first championship. They repeated as Stanley Cup champions in 2021 with Stamkos playing every playoff game this time playing all 23 games and recording 8 goals, 10 assists and 18 points. On December 16, 2021, Stamkos recorded his 900th point in a game against the Ottawa Senators with an assist on a goal scored by Victor Hedman. On March 16, 2022, Stamkos played his 900th NHL game against the Seattle Kraken which saw the Lightning win 4–1 and Stamkos record three assists. On April 26, 2022 in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets which saw the Lightning win 4–1, Stamkos recorded his 100th point of the season on a second period goal. His 39th goal of the season on Elvis Merzlikins would make this be the first time he recorded 100 points in a season. In the 2021–22 season finale against the New York Islanders on April 29, 2022, Stamkos recorded his 10th career hat-trick to bump his goal scoring total to 40, 41 and 42 in the season, which saw the Lightning win 6–4. This would mark the sixth time in his career where he recorded 40 or more goals. Stamkos finished the 2021–22 season recording 42 goals, 64 assists and 106 points in 81 games played. His 42 goals led the team for goal scoring and the 64 assists (second on team for the season behind the 65 Victor Hedman recorded) and 106 points recorded would be new career highs. His 106 points also led the team in points as well. Stamkos and the Lightning would eventually go to a third consecutive appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals (fourth altogether under his captaincy) which would see the Lightning lose in 6 games to the Colorado Avalanche. The 2022–23 season would be full of milestones for Stamkos. On November 15, 2022, Stamkos recorded his 500th assist against the Dallas Stars on an OT goal scored by Alex Killorn. On December 1, 2022, Stamkos recorded his 1,000th point, assisting on a Nick Paul goal in a 4–1 win against the Philadelphia Flyers. He became the 95th player, the 14th first overall pick, and the first player in Lightning history to record 1,000 NHL points. On January 18, 2023, in a 5–2 win over the Vancouver Canucks, Stamkos became the first player in Lightning history to record 500 career goals, the third active player at the time and the 47th player ever to achieve the feat. He capped off the night with his 11th career hat-trick, becoming the eighth player in NHL history to do so. He said it was "a humbling experience when you have a moment like that." On April 6, Stamkos played his 1,000th NHL game against the New York Islanders, becoming the second player from the Lightning to play all their games with the team, after Vincent Lecavalier. Stamkos ended the 2022–23 season with 34 goals, 50 assists and 84 points having played in 81 games. Stamkos was named the winner of the Mark Messier Leadership Award by former NHL player Mark Messier for contributions both on and off the ice. After being awarded the trophy, Stamkos went on to say "When you you have someone with the caliber of leader that Mark Messier has and what he's to our game, it's pretty special to have him hand select the winner. I am very proud of everything we have been able to accomplish in Tampa". On December 14, 2023, Stamkos recorded his first career four-goal game and 12th career hat-trick in a 7–4 win over the Edmonton Oilers. On January 25, 2024, Stamkos recorded his 1,100th point in a 6–3 Lightning win against the Arizona Coyotes with an assist on a goal scored by Nikita Kucherov, becoming the first player in Lightning history and 66th player in NHL history to reach the mark. Despite rumours floating around that he would be traded at the deadline in 2024 with the 2023–24 season being the final year of his contract signed in 2016, Lightning's general manager Julien BriseBois stated that there were no intentions to trade Stamkos. Stamkos' goal scoring ability and his ability to shoot the puck at a high velocity has been well documented, to the point where he has been compared to Alexander Ovechkin throughout his career, mainly with his left circle slapshot with that spot being known as the "office" for both. In October 2014, Lightning head coach Jon Cooper characterized Stamkos and Ovechkin's goal scoring reputations and rivalry as one that creates a "tension-building" atmosphere. In February 2019, former NHL coach Scotty Bowman described Stamkos as a player who "Doesn't need a lot of chances to score and has always been a sniper". While Stamkos has been known for being a prolific scorer, he has been shown to be an efficient playmaker and doesn't shy away from getting physical with opponents in forechecking or backchecking scenarios. In March 2013, Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby quoted Stamkos as a player who will "make you pay every time he gets a chance". Stamkos has also been widely praised by his superiors for his leadership abilities and his ability to lead by example on and off the ice. In June 2015, during the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks, Lightning teammate Valtteri Filppula described Stamkos as "an example for everybody that works hard". Former player Jeremy Roenick also expressed admiration for Stamkos' leadership abilities in August 2016 by saying "Every time I’ve talked to him, I’m so impressed. I am impressed with his leadership, his professionalism. I’m obviously impressed with his talent and what he can do.” During the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals in June 2022 against the Colorado Avalanche, Lightning teammate Patrick Maroon labeled Stamkos as the "heartbeat" of the Lightning. On June 30, 2017, Stamkos married his long-time girlfriend Sandra Porzio. The ceremony was held in Toronto and was attended by several of his current and former teammates. He and Sandra have two sons. On October 26, 2017, the Sarnia Sting announced it was retiring Stamkos' number 91. This was done in a ceremony on January 12, 2018. Stamkos was the first player to have his jersey retired in the 23-year history of the Sting. Stamkos played for Canada in the 2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he helped the team win a gold medal. After his rookie season with the Lightning, Stamkos was named to Canada's senior roster for the 2009 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. Stamkos continued to impress at the 2009 IIHF World Championships, scoring on his first career shift and meshing with fellow Lightning forward Martin St. Louis for seven goals, 11 points and a +9 plus-minus rating en route to a 2–1 loss to Russia in the finals. He was also selected as a reserve by Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics and scored seven goals in Canada's fifth-place finish at the 2013 World Championships. Stamkos was expected to be a major contributor for Canada in Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympics and was named to the roster, but his injuries sustained prior to the NHL Olympic break, including a broken tibia sustained in November 2013, prevented him from participating. The NHL prohibited its players to take part in the 2018 and 2022 Winter Olympics, which prevented him from participating in those games as well. On March 2, 2016, Hockey Canada named Stamkos to its roster for the 2016 World Cup of Hockey in Toronto. Stamkos won the tournament with Team Canada after a 2–1 win over Team Europe in Game 2 of the best-of-three series. He recorded a goal as well as an assist in the tournament, with a plus-minus rating of +3. Following his selection into the NHL, Stamkos signed a number of sponsorships, including an athlete's agreement with Nike. He was featured in a web-only Nike commercial called Forget Everything, which was released to coincide with his first game in his hometown of Unionville on October 28, 2008. He has also endorsed Tissot watches. On June 22, 2011, Stamkos was named the cover athlete for the EA Sports' NHL 12 video game. In late 2013, he played the leading role in a web commercial for Coca-Cola Zero named "Shawn Warford's Moment Zero." Most recently, Stamkos signed a multi-year sponsorship with Sport Chek, Canada's largest sports retailer.
