Servant of the People (Ukrainian: Слуга народу, romanized: Sluha narodu, Russian: Слуга народа, romanized: Sluga naroda), sometimes also known as Servant of the Nation, is a Ukrainian political satire comedy television series created and produced by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who stars as Vasily Petrovych Goloborodko, a high-school history teacher in his thirties who is unexpectedly elected President of Ukraine after a viral video filmed by one of his students shows him making a profane rant against government corruption in his country. The series ran for three seasons from 2015 to 2019, and a film adaptation was released in 2016. The series was produced by Kvartal 95, which was founded by Zelenskyy. It would become much more involved in Ukraine's actual politics; in 2018, a political party named after the television series was registered, and Zelenskyy was elected president of Ukraine in 2019. After being filmed by a student engaged in a profane rant about corruption in Ukraine and the student uploading the footage to YouTube, Vasily Petrovych Goloborodko (Volodymyr Zelenskyy), an absent-minded high-school history teacher who lives with his parents, turns into an Internet sensation overnight. Goloborodko's students launch a crowdfunding campaign for registering his candidacy in Ukraine's presidential race unbeknownst to him, eventually propelling their flabbergasted teacher to political victory as the new president of Ukraine. While in office, Vasily is confused at his newfound responsibilities, but gradually eases into his presidential duties and decides to weed out corruption by the oligarchy in his government.

The studio also posted all episodes for free on YouTube. The first season of the show was added to Netflix in select countries in 2017. Sometime in 2021 Netflix lost licensing rights. In March 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, Netflix re-licensed the first season, and in May 2022 added the second and third seasons for 33+ countries. The Netflix release combines the first two episodes into one in both season one and two, resulting in 23 episodes instead of 24 for both seasons. Belarusian TV channel Belarus-1 started broadcasting the show in evening prime time on 11 November 2019. The Russian channel TNT aired the pilot episode of the show's first series on 11 December 2019, claiming it did so as "a marketing move to raise awareness of the platform". TNT cut a scene from the episode in which president-elect Goloborodko asked if Russian President Vladimir Putin wore a Hublot watch, a joke referring to a well-known anti-Putin chant in Ukraine. In the United States, HITN presents the series in a Spanish language version. Jewish Life Television carries the series in its original Russian and Ukrainian languages, with English subtitles. A film adaptation of the series, Servant of the People 2, was released in 2016. The second season used footage from the film to expand on its plot and was released in 2017, bringing the film into the series' main continuity. The third season was released in 2019. Zelenskyy would later mirror his character's rise to political power in being elected President of Ukraine in 2019. After his victory was announced, Zelenskyy walked onto the stage at his campaign headquarters with the show's theme playing. In the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and Zelenskyy's wartime leadership, the show's popularity received a notable boost. Broadcasting rights have been requested by various foreign companies. On March 16, Netflix announced that season 1 of the series would be available to US streamers again due to popular demand. On May 16, Netflix added seasons 2 and 3. During 2022, Zelenskyy won widespread admiration as a resistance figure against Russia and Putin, leading to the series becoming more popular in turn. Foreign broadcasting companies have sought to air Servant of the People on their own channels.  Albania: Tring TV (14 March 2022 -), TV Klan (19 April 2022 – )  Australia: Special Broadcasting Service (28 February 2022 - 28 February 2023)  Belarus: Belarus-1 (11 November 2019 – )  Brazil: HBO Max  Bulgaria: NOVA (18 April 2022 – )  Canada: Vision TV (5 April 2022 - )  Estonia: TV3 (5 April 2022 - ), TV3+ (1 April 2022 – )[better source needed]  Finland: Yle  France: ARTE (November 2021 on ARTE.tv, 8 April 2022 on ARTE), 6play from M6 (March 2022)  Georgia: Not announced yet  Germany: ARTE  Greece: ANT1 (7 March 2022 – 12 April 2022) (Cancelled after Season 1 due to low ratings; low ratings existed since premiere)  Hungary: RTL (20 March 2022 – 19 November 2022)  Italy: La7 (4 April 2022 - )  Kosovo: Kohavision (31 March 2022 – ) Latin America: Netflix and HBO Max  Latvia: TV3 (28 March 2022 – 6 May 2022)  Lithuania: TV3 (21 March 2022 – ), TV6 (April 2022 – ) Middle East: MBC  Moldova: Jurnal TV  North Macedonia: Kanal 5  Portugal: Netflix  Romania: Pro TV  Russia: TNT (only the pilot episode), Kinopoisk  Serbia: Nova S (21 September 2019 – )[citation needed]  Slovakia: Markíza (28 March 2022), Dajto (2 April 2022 – )  Slovenia: Voyo (17 April 2022 – )  Spain: Telecinco (14 April 2022 – )  Sweden: SVT  Tunisia: Hannibal TV  Turkey: Not announced yet  Ukraine: 1+1  United Kingdom: Channel 4 (6 March 2022 – )  United States: HITN - Spanish-language (April 2022), JLTV (19 September 2022 – )  Vietnam: K+ (22 February 2022 – ), SCTN (04 September 2023 – ) In some countries: Netflix An American remake was ordered by Hulu, with British writer Simon Farnaby involved in its development, though the show was scrapped when Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States.
