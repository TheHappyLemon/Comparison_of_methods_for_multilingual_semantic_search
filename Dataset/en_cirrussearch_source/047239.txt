Tallinn Synagogue, (Estonian: Tallinna s√ºnagoog), also known as Beit Bella Synagogue, is located in Estonia's capital city. The privately funded synagogue in central Tallinn was inaugurated on May 16, 2007. The building is an ultramodern, airy structure, which can seat 180 people with additional seating for up to 230 people for concerts and other public events. It received global attention as it was the first synagogue to open in Estonia since World War II. The original synagogue, built in 1883, was not rebuilt after being destroyed in March 1944 during a Soviet air bombing raid on Tallinn, which at the time was occupied by Nazi Germany - the city then became the only post-war European capital without a synagogue. The Tartu Synagogue, located in Tartu, a university city in southeastern Estonia and the second largest city in Estonia, was also destroyed during World War II.
