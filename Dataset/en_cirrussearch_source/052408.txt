Liuzhou (/ljuːˈdʒoʊ/; Chinese: 柳州, IPA Pronunciation:[ljòʊ.ʈʂóʊ]) is a prefecture-level city in north-central Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China. The prefecture's population was 4,157,934 as of 2020 census, including 2,519,051 in the built-up area made of five urban districts. Its total area is 18,594 km2 (7,179 sq mi) and 3,559.4 km2 (1,374.3 sq mi) for the built-up area. Liuzhou is located on the banks of the winding Liu River, approximately 255 km (158 mi) from Nanning, the regional capital.

Swimming in the river is a tradition of the city. The river is normally green, but sometimes in summer, floods from the mountain areas upstream bring sediment which colors the water yellow. In early 2012, a cadmium spill upstream caused serious pollution worries. The river can be deep. Normally, the depth is 60–70 metres (200–230 ft) but can as deep as 90 metres (300 ft) before it floods over the wall. In 2000 a bus, with 78 passengers, fell over the side of a bridge, and into 27 metres (89 ft) of water.

Born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou because, in the past, the city was known for its coffins, made from firwood, camphor wood, and sandalwood, which are said to preserve the body after death. Guangzhou's "Cantonese" cuisine is famous worldwide, and Hangzhou is known for its prosperity and the beauty of its location. Suzhou is reputed to have the most beautiful people in China, so the line is sometimes given as "Marry in Suzhou...". Today many tourists buy miniature coffins, about 3 to 30 cm (1.2 to 11.8 in) long, as souvenirs or good luck charms. The coffins are usually inscribed 升官发财 (shēng guān fā cái) which means 'get promotion and get rich". The second and fourth characters are homophones of 棺材 (guāncái) meaning 'coffin'. Some miniature coffins are used as caskets to hold the ashes of ancestors. Liuzhou was the home of Li Ning (born 1963), gymnast and entrepreneur who lit the Olympic torch in Beijing in 2008.
