The 1982–83 season of the European Cup football club tournament was won for the first time by Hamburg, who beat Juventus 1–0 in the final at Athens' Olympic Stadium. It was the first time since 1976 that the trophy was not won by an English club. Aston Villa, the defending champions, were eliminated by Juventus in the quarter-finals. Villa's 3–1 victory over Beşiktaş J.K. was played behind closed doors due to trouble from the Villa crowd against Anderlecht in the previous season’s semi-final in Brussels. Liverpool, the other English side in the tournament, were defeated by Polish champions Widzew Lodz, also in the quarter-finals. 25 August 1982 Stadionul 23 August, Bucharest Attendance: 31,200 Referee: Arsen Hoxha (Albania) 1 September 1982 Ullevaal Stadion, Oslo Attendance: 3,440 Referee: Osmo Orakangas (Finland) Dinamo București won 4–3 on aggregate 15 September 1982 Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion, East Berlin Attendance: 22,000 Referee: Jan Keizer (Netherlands) 15 September 1982 Olympic Stadium, Athens Attendance: 71,000 Referee: Paolo Casarin (Italy) 15 September 1982 Stadiumi Kombëtar Qemal Stafa, Tirana Attendance: 19,000 Referee: Evangelos Giannakoudakis (Greece) 15 September 1982 20:00 Hardturm, Zürich Attendance: 11,600 Referee: Marcel Bacou (France) 15 September 1982 Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb Attendance: 20,000 Referee: Alek Jarguz (Poland) 15 September 1982 Stade du Ray, Nice Attendance: 12,147 Referee: Victoriano Sánchez Arminio (Spain) 15 September 1982 Celtic Park, Glasgow Attendance: 56,299 Referee: Erik Fredriksson (Sweden) 15 September 1982 Laugardalsvöllur, Reykjavík Attendance: 983 Referee: Oliver Donnelly (Northern Ireland) 15 September 1982 Empire Stadium, Gżira Attendance: 3,497 Referee: Alf Grey (England) 15 September 1982 Stade Josy Barthel, Luxembourg City Attendance: 1,300 Referee: Egbert Mulder (Netherlands) 15 September 1982 Makario Stadium, Nikosia Attendance: 12,000 Referee: Ivan Yosifov (Bulgaria) 14 September 1982 Oriel Park, Dundalk Attendance: 16,100 Referee: Henning Lund-Sørensen (Denmark) 15 September 1982 Villa Park, Birmingham Attendance: 150 Referee: Rolf Nyhus (Norway) 15 September 1982 Stadionul 23 August, Bucharest Attendance: 39,000 Referee: Károly Palotai (Hungary) 15 September 1982 Sclessin, Liège Attendance: 11,000 Referee: Torben Månsson (Denmark) 15 September 1982 Idrætsparken, Copenhagen Attendance: 30,289 Referee: George Smith (Scotland) 29 September 1982 Volksparkstadion, Hamburg Attendance: 35,000 Referee: Keith Hackett (England) Hamburg won 3–1 on aggregate 29 September 1982 Värendsvallen, Växjö Attendance: 6,399 Referee: Aleksander Suchanek (Poland) Olympiacos won 2–1 on aggregate 29 September 1982 Windsor Park, Belfast Attendance: 4,900 Referee: Roger Schoeters (Belgium) 2–2 on aggregate;
