"Perfect Day" is the fifth and final single released from Cascada's second album Perfect Day. "Perfect Day" was released in the United States as a CD Maxi Single on 3 March 2009 and on 17 February 2009 on iTunes. It was also released as a download in certain European countries on 13 February 2010, almost a year after the United States release. After the release of Cascada's 2008 Summer hit "Because the Night", it was rumored "Perfect Day" would be the next single released, but no confirmation was made. Natalie Horler had performed the song at Clubland Live 2008, but did not mention that the song would be released as a single. Again, on the Perfect Day Tour, Horler did not mention anything about "Perfect Day" being the next single, and did not perform any songs from the up-coming untitled album. Fans suggested it was just a rumor, as the next album was soon to be released, but the song was released as the third North American single following "What Hurts The Most" & "Faded".
