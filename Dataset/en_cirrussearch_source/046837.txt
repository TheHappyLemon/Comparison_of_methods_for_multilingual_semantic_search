The 2019 E3 BinckBank Classic is a road cycling one-day race, scheduled to be held on 29 March 2019 in Belgium. It is the 62nd edition of E3 Harelbeke and the eleventh event of the 2019 UCI World Tour. The event was rebranded "E3 BinckBank Classic" due to a sponsorship agreement with Dutch online discount broker BinckBank. However, the race perpetuates its ties with Harelbeke, which continues to host the start and finish. The total distance is 203.9 kilometres (126.7Â mi), featuring 15 categorized climbs in the Flemish Ardennes and five flat sectors of cobbled roads. Dutch rider Niki Terpstra won the previous edition in 2018. "UCI announces 2019 road calendar". Cycling News. Archived from the original on 28 March 2020. Retrieved 28 October 2018.
