The Debenham Islands are a group of islands and rocks lying between Millerand Island and the west coast of Graham Land. The Debenham Islands were discovered and named by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) (1934–37) under John Riddoch Rymill; the BGLE base was on Barry Island, in the center of the group, during part of this time. They were named for Frank Debenham, who served as a member of the BGLE Advisory Committee. The Argentinian San Martín Base is located on Barry Island.
