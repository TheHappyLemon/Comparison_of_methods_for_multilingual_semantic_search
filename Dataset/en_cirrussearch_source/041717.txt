Kendall Jamaal Waston Manley (born 1 January 1988) is a Costa Rican professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Liga FPD club Saprissa and the Costa Rica national team. Waston made his professional debut for Saprissa in 2006 and played on loan for Carmelita in the Primera División de Costa Rica before moving abroad for a six-month loan spell with Club Nacional de Football in the Primera División Uruguaya from February 2008. In March 2010, Waston signed a three-month loan deal with Bayamón of the Puerto Rico Soccer League to help the club qualify for the CONCACAF Champions League.

On 25 October 2014, Waston scored the only goal in the Whitecaps' final game of the regular season, heading in a corner kick from Pedro Morales, sending the Whitecaps to the playoffs for the second time in their four years since joining MLS. The impact that Waston had on the Whitecaps' season after joining the club earned him a nomination for MLS Player of the Month for October. Waston played his 100th MLS game for the Whitecaps on 26 May 2018, against San Jose. He signed a new contract before the 2018 season, becoming a designated player under league rules.

Vancouver received $450,000 of General Allocation Money, $300,000 of Targeted Allocation Money and an international roster spot. Waston captained the team for the majority of the 2019 MLS season.[citation needed] He was released by Cincinnati at the end of their 2020 season.
