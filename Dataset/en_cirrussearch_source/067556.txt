Anna's Archive is a search engine for shadow libraries. It was founded by the Pirate Library Mirror, a team of anonymous archivists, in direct response to law enforcement efforts to close down Z-Library in 2022. It describes itself as a project that aims to "catalog all the books in existence" and to "track humanity's progress toward making all these books easily available in digital form".[dubious – discuss] Anna's Archive mirrors Library Genesis, Open Library, Sci-Hub and Z-Library. Anna's Archive says that it does not host copyrighted materials and that it only indexes metadata that is already publicly available. As of April 1, 2024[update], Anna's Archive includes 30,702,128 books and 99,901,919 papers. In October 2023, Anna's Archive was reported to have "scraped" (downloaded the entirety of) WorldCat, the world's largest book metadata database. Anna's Archive says that the scrape "marks a major milestone in mapping out all the books in the world" and that it allows them to "work on making a to-do list of all the books that still need to be preserved". In response to the scrape, Anna's Archive was sued in February 2024 by OCLC, one of the maintainers of WorldCat. OCLC says that the scrape was the result of cyberattacks on its servers and that Anna's Archive allows public download of scraped data. In January 2024, Anna's Archive was blocked in Italy due to a copyright complaint by the Italian Publishers Association. On March 23, 2024, the Dutch pirate site blocklist has been reported to now include Anna's Archive and Library Genesis, based on a request by BREIN, a local anti-piracy group. #ICanHazPDF Library Genesis Z-Library Van der Sar, Ernesto (November 19, 2022).
