Dusetos (pronunciation) is a city in Zarasai district municipality, northeastern Lithuania, 30 km (19 mi) west of Zarasai, near Lake Sartai. According to the 1923 census, 704 Jews were living in the town. As a result of out-migration in the 1920s and 1930s, the number of Jews in the town decreased to around 500 by 1939. On August 26, 1941, Jews of Dusetos, together with the Jews of Zarasai were murdered in a mass execution perpetrated by forces of Einsatzkommando 3, assisted by the Lithuanian police.
