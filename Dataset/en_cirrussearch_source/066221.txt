The film is based on the series Oggy and the Cockroaches, a silent slapstick comedy series similar to that of Hanna-Barbera's Tom and Jerry. This is the last film Olivier Jean-Marie made before his death on May 13, 2021. The film revolves around the eponymous characters' adventures throughout four timelines, composed of self-contained stories in a chronological order. These stories also feature Jack, Bob and Olivia. The basis of the movie also became the theme of the fifth season of Oggy and the Cockroaches, which also took place in a variety of countries, like Ancient Egypt and China, within three, separately self-contained episodes. Within opening text vaguely stating an "extremely long time ago", a blue amoeba forms in the sea of a mysterious, unevolved planet. This amoeba is revealed to be Oggy, whose appearance gets made fun of by three other amoeba â€“ Joey, Dee Dee and Marky. Distraught, Oggy chases after the pesky trio. These amoebae then slowly evolve into cats and three cockroaches, respectively, to which Oggy ends up having to chase after them on a desert island. Oggy Magnon In 120 Kya, the cats evolved into neanderthals, and live in villages . Oggy and Jack have to obtain fire for the tribe's chief, after Oggy accidentally snuffs out the fire trying to catch the cockroaches. However, it is revealed Oggy dislikes the idea, due to a bad childhood memory. They however, are made to comply. Oggy and Jack hike to the volcano, with the cockroaches causing problems for them. After scaling the volcano, Oggy descends into the volcano, and finds that the inside is lush. Oggy passes out, and is then captured by a group of hyenas. The hyenas take Oggy to their leader Bob, who decides to eat him. But, Oggy is saved by Olivia, who nurses him. Oggy bonds with Olivia, while Jack descends and meets her. The cockroaches lead Bob and his group to the trio, and Jack and Olivia are captured. Oggy makes a torch and saves the two, and trio are able to escape Bob. Upon arriving at the village, give to fire to the chief and the day is saved. In the medieval story "Prince Oggy II", Oggy and Jack work together to try and succeed at quests from Oggy's father, a noble figure and king, who also defeated the detested cockroach king. The two also discover forest-dwelling Olivia, who was to be assigned a princess, but later is kidnapped and held captive in a castle by the cockroaches. In "The Incredible Jack Holmes & Oggy Watson", based on the story Sherlock Holmes, Dee Dee and Marky steal Olivia's key to Big Ben. She thus asks the detective Jack Holmes for help, with Oggy Watson helping out on their adventure as much as he can. With London's year coming to an end, hijinx ensues. In "Oggy-Wan Kenoggy", parodying Star Wars and the film Star Wars: A New Hope, Oggy-Wan Kenoggy (with the help of Jack) traverses through space itself to hijack a ship. Tasked to stop Bob Vader from trying to destroy the world, he readies himself with his lightsaber. However, Bob has another idea; he sends out his troops, the three cockroaches. It doesn't go as they might expect. After the fourth timeline ends with a large explosion, Bob cries in frustration at the sight of his now-destroyed ship and the eponymous characters end up falling into a vast ocean. They evolve from small amoebas to a cat and a trio of cockroaches, once more. However, an offscreen incident Oggy yowls from sends the cockroaches into laughter.
