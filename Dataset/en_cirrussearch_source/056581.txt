Omolon (Russian: Омолон) is a rural locality (a selo) in Bilibinsky District of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia. It is situated in the far southwest of the district near the border with Magadan Oblast. Population: 873 (2010 Census); Municipally, Omolon is subordinated to Bilibinsky Municipal District and is incorporated as Omolon Rural Settlement. Omolon was the headquarters for the sovkhoz (state farm) Omolon until 1992 Prior to 1992, the Sovkhoz had 15 separate herds of reindeer under its control. From 1992 onwards, the Sovkhoz structure was dismantled bit by bit in line with the wider course of Russian privatisation. Previously, the Sovkhoz had been in control of all of the major community services, such as power, education, health and other functions, which were now administered individually at rural settlement or district administrative level. Four of the 15 brigades split from the former Sovkhoz and formed their own private enterprise and those remaining formed a limited liability company called TOO "Omolon"'. This privatisation was not a success. Where previously the Sovkhoz had controlled the settlement's economy and its associated facilities, by 1998 there were nine separate entities involved in the same work and the number of reindeer held by the brigades had fallen from nearly 34,000 to just over 9,000. The village, previously called Oloy, Unyagan, and Shcherbakovo before the current name was settled upon in 1960, is the most isolated populated place in Bilibinsky District. Omolon is situated on the right bank of the Omolon River, with the Ush-Urekchen rising to the north. The village is 670 kilometers (420 mi) from Bilibino and 780 kilometers (480 mi) from Anadyr. The main occupation of the inhabitants is reindeer herding. The population as of the beginning of January 2012 was 855, mainly Evens, a reduction on the official 2010 census record of 873, of whom 453 were male and 420 female. This represents a fall of around 200 from a 2006 estimate of 1,050 of which around 800 were indigenous peoples. As of January 2012, the ethnic make up of the village was as following: Source: Note: "Other" includes Russians and Ukrainians amongst others. Based on a 2006 estimate, the population was 1,050 of which around 800 are indigenous peoples, mainly Evens and Chukchi, up from 936 people as recorded by an environmental impact report prepared in 2005 for the Kupol Gold Project. The head of the rural settlement is Viktoriya Valbertovna Sirova. Omolon is not connected by road to any other inhabited locality. The only means of access to the village is along the Omolon River, which is navigable when not frozen, or by air. There are plans to build a road, to be known as the Anadyr Highway, from the Kolyma Highway near Magadan to Omolon and further to Anadyr and Bilibino. Omolon Airport "Shcherbakhovo" with ICAO code UHMN is located at the edge of the village. There is however a network of streets within the village including: Улица Авиаторов (Ulitsa Aviatorov, lit.
