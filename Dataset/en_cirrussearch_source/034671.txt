Mia Malkova (born July 1, 1992) is an American pornographic actress and media personality. She has won several awards, including the 2014 AVN Award for the Best New Starlet and the 2017 XBIZ Award for the Best Actress. Malkova has also acted in an Indian pornographic short monologue documentary and an Indian erotic thriller film, both directed by Ram Gopal Varma. By 2022, she had mostly retired from pornography in favor of video game livestreaming on Twitch. Malkova has been described as one of the most popular pornographic actresses in the world. Before entering the adult industry, Malkova worked in the food-service industry, getting her first job at McDonald's when she turned 16, and then working at Sizzler until the weekend she shot her first scene. Malkova was 'Twistys Treat of the Month' in December 2012 and the 2013 'Twistys Treat of the Year'. She was a contract performer for its parent company, Aylo, during that time. When that contract lapsed in 2014, she signed a contract with another company, Hard X, to exclusively perform scenes with men while being allowed to perform scenes without men with other companies. Malkova was October 2016's Penthouse Pet of the Month. Malkova is the focus of Ram Gopal Varma's 2018 documentary film God, Sex and Truth about the strength of women's sexuality and beauty. In an interview, she stated that the only reason she got into porn is because she loves sex and the porn world is the best and safest place to explore it in all its forms. In December 2019, she and Hearthstone streamer Trump released a duet singing "A Whole New World" together. In April 2020, Malkova and 11 other adult/former adult actresses appeared in the music video for the G-Eazy song "Still Be Friends". In October 2020, Malkova appeared in the music video for the Ninja Sex Party song "Wondering Tonight". The same year, she again worked with Ram Gopal Varma to play the lead role in the Indian erotic thriller Climax. The movie, which was released through an over-the-top media service, was commercially successful despite receiving negative reviews from both critics and the audience. In January 2022, she co-hosted the 39th AVN Awards along with fellow pornographic performer Mighty Emelia. During the early 2020's, Malkova started gaining attention as a Twitch streamer and as an OnlyFans content creator. She mostly retired from the porn industry to focus on Twitch streaming. Malkova standing with her buttocks to the camera was the most popular Twitch clip in May 2021. As of March 2022, Malkova has more than 634,000 followers on Twitch. Malkova's hometown is Palm Springs, California. Her brother, Justin Hunt, is also a pornographic actor. She has stated that she is an atheist. Killington, Buzz (May 3, 2013).
