Sobótka (pronounced So-boo-tka [sɔˈbutka], German: Zobten am Berge) is a town in Wrocław County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It is the seat of the administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Sobótka. Sobótka is located about 30 km (19 mi) southwest of Wrocław on the northern slope of Mount Ślęża, part of the Central Sudetes mountain range. As of 2019[update], the town has a population of 6,981. The area had been settled since prehistoric times, as evidenced by numerous archaeological artefacts, and in the 2nd century BC Mount Ślęża was a religious site of the Celtic Boii tribe, marking a northern outpost of their settlement area. In 1128, the Polish voivode Piotr Włostowic established an Augustinian monastery on Mount Ślęża which was later moved to Wrocław, while the area remained a property of the Augustinian order. The settlement was first mentioned in an 1148 bull issued by Pope Eugene III as Sabath, the name most likely referring to a weekly Saturday (Latin: sabbatum, Polish: sobota) market. The market rights were confirmed by the Silesian duke Bolesław I the Tall in 1193. His son Duke Henry I the Bearded granted Sobótka town privileges based on the Magdeburg Law in 1221. The location of the city is on the ancient Amber Road and its first role was trade. After the Polish King Casimir III the Great renounced his rights to Silesia in 1348, Sobótka, as part of the Duchy of Świdnica, eventually passed to the Bohemian crown in 1392. King Wenceslaus confirmed Sobótka's town privileges in 1399. The town was again purchased by the Augustinians in 1494. As part of the Habsburg monarchy the town was devastated by the Thirty Years' War. With most of Silesia it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742. King Frederick William III finally secularized the Augustinian territory in 1810. From 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II the town became part of Poland, in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. On December 31, 1959, the village of Strzeblów was included within the town limits.
