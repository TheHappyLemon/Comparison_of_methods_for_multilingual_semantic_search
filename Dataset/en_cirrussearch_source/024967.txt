The federal districts (Russian: федера́льные округа́, romanized: federalnyye okruga) are groupings of the federal subjects of Russia. Federal districts are not mentioned in the nation's constitution, and do not have competences of their own and do not manage regional affairs. They exist solely to monitor consistency between the federal and regional bodies of law, and ensuring governmental control over the civil service, judiciary, and federal agencies, operating in the regions.

The federal districts of Russia were established by President Vladimir Putin in 2000 to facilitate the federal government's task of controlling the then 89 federal subjects across the country. On 19 January 2010, the new North Caucasian Federal District split from the Southern Federal District. In March 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, the Crimean Federal District was established.

On 28 July 2016 the Crimean Federal District was abolished and merged into the Southern Federal District in order to improve governance. In November 2018, Buryatia and Zabaykalsky Krai were removed from the Siberian Federal District and added to the Far Eastern Federal District in accordance with a decree issued by Putin. The Administrative Centre of the Far Eastern Federal District relocated from Khabarovsk to Vladivostok in December 2018.
