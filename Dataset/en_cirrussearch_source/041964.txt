Tiesj Benoot (born 11 March 1994) is a Belgian cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Visma–Lease a Bike. Benoot turned professional with the Belgian UCI World Tour team Lotto–Soudal in 2015, after riding for the Lotto–Belisol U23 outfit in 2013 and 2014, and riding some races as a stagiaire in autumn 2014. Benoot made an instant impact in the professional ranks by placing fifth in his first Tour of Flanders. Later in the season he showed his abilities in stage races, finishing second overall behind Greg Van Avermaet at the 2015 Tour of Belgium. He also claimed three top-10 finishes in stages of the Critérium du Dauphiné. Benoot showed climbing ability at the 2017 Critérium du Dauphiné, where he finished 12th overall. In June 2017, he was named in the startlist for the 2017 Tour de France. Benoot finished 20th overall in his first Grand Tour. Benoot won his first professional race in March 2018, soloing to victory in the UCI World Tour's Strade Bianche in torrential rain after attacking from a chasing group to catch leaders Romain Bardet (AG2R La Mondiale) and Wout van Aert (Vérandas Willems–Crelan) before dropping them in the final sector of dirt roads. Benoot soloed to victory by 39 seconds ahead of Bardet. In August 2018, he was named in the startlist for the 2018 Vuelta a España. In August 2019, Benoot signed an initial two-year deal with Team Sunweb starting from 2020. He finished second overall at the 2020 Paris–Nice, winning a stage and the points classification. Following the COVID-19 pandemic-enforced suspension of racing, Benoot took top-ten finishes at Liège–Bastogne–Liège (eighth) and the Tour of Flanders (tenth). He also extended his contract with the team until the end of the 2022 season in August 2020. Benoot took no wins in 2021, with a best result of fifth overall at Paris–Nice. In December 2021, Benoot was released from his Team DSM contract a year early, and subsequently signed a two-year deal with Team Jumbo–Visma starting from 2022. He made his first start with the team at February's Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, and recorded his first top-ten finish with ninth at the E3 Saxo Bank Classic the following month. He finished second at Dwars door Vlaanderen, having attacked the lead group in the final two kilometres, before being out-sprinted by Mathieu van der Poel at the finish in Waregem. With team leader Wout van Aert sidelined due to COVID-19, Benoot shared team leadership of Team Jumbo–Visma for the following weekend's Tour of Flanders, with Christophe Laporte; Laporte finished ninth while Benoot was thirteenth. The following weekend, Benoot finished third in the Amstel Gold Race, having attacked from the main group in the final kilometre of the race. Team Jumbo-Visma had a historic performance in the 2022 Tour de France. Benoot played a key role supporting the team leaders, especially as injuries and abandons took their toll throughout the race. He survived the race and crossed the finish line in triumph with his surviving teammates. Outside of cycling, Benoot studied economics at Ghent University. Benoot's uncommon first name derives from American singer/songwriter Tish Hinojosa, due to his parents' affinity with both the music and the first name of the artist. 2011 7th Overall Tour du Valromey 2012 2nd Overall Junior Oberösterreichrundfahrt 1st Points classification 1st Stage 2 3rd Time trial, National Junior Road Championships 3rd Overall Trophée Centre Morbihan 5th Bernaudeau Junior 6th Overall GP Général Patton 8th Overall Liège–La Gleize 8th Overall Keizer der Juniores 1st Stage 1 2013 1st Tour de Moselle 2nd Overall Vuelta a Palencia 1st Stage 4 4th Overall Circuit des Ardennes 1st Points classification 1st Young rider classification 8th Grand Prix des Marbriers 8th Liège–Bastogne–Liège Espoirs 10th Overall Vuelta a la Comunidad de Madrid Under-23 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 2 2014 2nd Overall Le Triptyque des Monts et Châteaux 1st Points classification 3rd Overall Ronde de l'Isard 1st Young rider classification 3rd Ronde van Vlaanderen Beloften 4th Road race, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 4th Grote Prijs Stad Zottegem 5th Liège–Bastogne–Liège Espoirs 5th Flèche Ardennaise 6th Road race, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 8th Binche–Chimay–Binche 10th Overall Danmark Rundt 2015 2nd Overall Tour of Belgium 3rd Handzame Classic 4th Le Samyn 4th Paris–Tours 5th Tour of Flanders 5th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal 6th Overall World Ports Classic 6th Ronde van Zeeland Seaports 6th Dwars door Vlaanderen 6th Druivenkoers Overijse 8th Overall Eneco Tour 8th Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 2016 1st Young rider classification, Volta ao Algarve 3rd Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 3rd Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 4th Trofeo Pollenca–Port de Andratx 5th Overall Tour de Pologne 6th Grand Prix de Wallonie 7th E3 Harelbeke 7th Brussels Cycling Classic 8th Strade Bianche 9th Heistse Pijl 2017 3rd Brabantse Pijl 3rd Trofeo Pollenca–Port de Andratx 4th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 4th Grand Prix de Wallonie 7th Overall Tour of Belgium 7th Dwars door Vlaanderen 8th Overall Volta ao Algarve 1st Young rider classification 8th Strade Bianche 8th Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 8th Vuelta a Murcia 9th Clásica de San Sebastián 2018 (1 pro win) 1st Strade Bianche 3rd Brabantse Pijl 4th Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Young rider classification 5th E3 Harelbeke 5th Tour de l'Eurométropole 6th Overall Vuelta a San Juan 6th Paris–Tours 7th Dwars door Vlaanderen 8th Tour of Flanders 2019 (1) 1st Stage 1 Danmark Rundt 2nd Bretagne Classic 4th Overall Tour de Suisse 4th Milano–Torino 5th Strade Bianche 5th Dwars door Vlaanderen 6th Tre Valli Varesine 9th Overall Tour of Britain 9th Tour of Flanders 10th Overall Vuelta a San Juan Combativity award Stage 9 Tour de France 2020 (1) 2nd Overall Paris–Nice 1st Points classification 1st Stage 6 8th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 10th Tour of Flanders 2021 5th Overall Paris–Nice 7th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 8th Overall Benelux Tour 9th Grand Prix de Wallonie 10th Antwerp Port Epic 2022 2nd Dwars door Vlaanderen 3rd Amstel Gold Race 3rd Clásica de San Sebastián 9th E3 Saxo Bank Classic 2023 (1) 1st Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 3rd Strade Bianche 4th Road race, National Road Championships 6th Coppa Bernocchi 7th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 7th La Flèche Wallonne 7th Bretagne Classic 9th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 10th Clásica de San Sebastián 2024 4th Dwars door Vlaanderen "Team Jumbo-Visma | Tiesj Benoot".
