The 2018 Dwars door Vlaanderen was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 28 March 2018 in Belgium. It was the 73rd edition of Dwars door Vlaanderen and the twelfth event of the 2018 UCI World Tour. It was won for the second year in a row by Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Floors) – becoming the first rider to win the race in consecutive years. He finished two seconds ahead of Team Sunweb's Mike Teunissen and Sep Vanmarcke, riding for the EF Education First–Drapac p/b Cannondale team, completed the podium. As the race was only added to the UCI World Tour calendar in 2017, all UCI WorldTeams were invited to the race, but not obligated to compete in the race. As such, seventeen of the eighteen WorldTeams – with the exception of Groupama–FDJ – competed in the race, up one on 2017. Eight UCI Professional Continental teams competed, completing the 25-team peloton.
