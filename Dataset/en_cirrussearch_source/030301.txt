Villages of Čechyně, Královopolské Vážany, Kroužek, Rousínovec, Slavíkovice and Vítovice are administrative parts of Rousínov. Rousínov is located about 15 kilometres (9 mi) east of Brno. It lies mostly in the Vyškov Gate, the southern part of the municipal territory lies in the Litenčice Hills. The Rakovec Stream flows through the town. The first written mention of Rousínov is from 1222. In 1321, it was last referred to as a village. It belonged to the Špilberk estate. It became an important crossroads of trade routes from Vienna and from Olomouc. Rousínov was a royal town until 1559, when Ferdinand I sold the Špilberk estate. The Jewish community existed here from the second half of the 15th century until 1919. The business activities of the Jews after the Thirty Years' War brought economic prosperity to the town. Until 1945, the village of Čechyně belonged to the German-speaking enclave called Vyškov Language Island. The area was colonized by German settlers in the second half of the 13th century. The coexistence of Czechs and Germans was mostly peaceful, which changed only after 1935, when many Germans tended to Nazism. In 1945, the German population was expelled. The D1 motorway goes around the town. Rousínov lies on the railway line from Brno to Vyškov.
