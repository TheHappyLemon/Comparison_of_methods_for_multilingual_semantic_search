Despite this, Tetiiv continued to exist as a shtetl and held a 95% Jewish population in 1897. In August 1919, Cossacks from the White Army ransacked the city, killing dozens of Jews. This was followed by a larger pogrom in March 1920, in which anti-Bolshevik insurgents went door to door destroying Jewish houses and killing civilians on sight, culminating in an arson attack on the synagogue while it housed 2,000 worshipers inside, followed by the gunning down of any survivors who tried to escape. An estimated 3,000-4,000 Jews died due to the Tetiyev pogroms and the remaining Jewish population completely fled the city, only returning a decade later. A significant diaspora from Tetiyev immigrated to Cleveland, Ohio, where they established the Oheb Zedek-Cedar Sinai Synagogue. The city was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941-1944. Until 18 July 2020, Tetiiv was the administrative center of Tetiiv Raion. The raion was abolished that day as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kyiv Oblast to seven. The area of Tetiiva Raion was merged into Bila Tserkva Raion. Since May 17, 2018,[citation needed] Tetiiv has been a member of the European Union's Mayors for Economic Growth Initiative.
