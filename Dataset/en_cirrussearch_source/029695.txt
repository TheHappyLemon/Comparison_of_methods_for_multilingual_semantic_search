A mimosa cocktail consists of champagne (or other sparkling wine) and chilled citrus juice, usually orange juice. It is often served in a tall champagne flute at festive occasions such as brunch, weddings, or as part of business or first class service on some passenger railways and airlines. The mixing ratio varies. The cocktail is named after the yellow-flowered mimosa plant, Acacia dealbata. The origin of the cocktail is unclear, and was originally called a "champagne orange". Some credit the Paris Ritz's bartender and cocktail writer Frank Meier for making the mimosa cocktail; however, Meier's 1934 book on mixing drinks, which has a special symbol for his inventions, does not use it for the mimosa. The mimosa can be considered as a variant of the cocktail Buck's Fizz, or vice-versa; Buck's Fizz appears to date from 1921. The International Bartenders Association simply says the mimosa is "Also known as Buck’s Fizz". The mimosa became popular in the United States in the 1960s. A news article published in the Sydney Morning Herald wrote about Queen Elizabeth II drinking a mimosa, introduced to her by Earl Mountbatten of Burma after his visit to the south of France. Buck's Fizz is essentially the same cocktail, said to have been invented in 1921 in London. Some sources draw a distinction, saying the Buck's Fizz specifically uses twice as much champagne as orange juice while the mimosa should use equal proportions, that a Buck's Fizz should be served without ice and a mimosa should include ice, or that a Buck's Fizz should be served in a flute or coupe and a mimosa should be served in an ordinary wine glass. However, some sources give instructions for making mimosas that clearly do not fit these characterizations. Other ingredients are sometimes added, such as Grand Marnier or orange bitters. The poinsettia is cranberry juice with champagne (sometimes with vodka and/or Cointreau). The lemosa is lemonade with champagne, with a small amount of blueberry syrup. The Vermosa is apple cider with champagne, notably served in Vermont, United States. Apple cider with champagne and brandy is called an apple crisp. The flirtini is made with pineapple juice, champagne and vodka. The megmosa is a similar type of cocktail, composed of equal parts champagne and grapefruit juice. The sherbet mimosa consists of champagne and a scoop of sherbet, instead of orange juice. The lychee rose mimosa consists of champagne with lychee and rosewater. The Hawaiian mimosa consists of rum, champagne, pineapple juice, orange juice, and cherry juice. "National Mimosa Day" is an unofficial holiday observed on May 16 in the US.
