Jessy Kimbangi (French pronunciation: [dʒɛsi kimbɑ̃ɡi]), better known by his stage name Jessy Matador, is a French singer. Matador began his career as a dancer in 2001. He later joined the group Dany Engobo’s band Les Cœurs Brisés (The Broken Hearts) with whom he toured the United States, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Kingdom, Italy and Canada. In 2005, he decided to create his own group called "La Sélésao" composed of members Dr. Love, Linho and Benkoff. The same members also formed the first edition of the group Magic System. In late 2007, they signed with Oyas Records before signing with Wagram Records in spring 2008. They released their début single "Décalé Gwada" in June 2008, becoming one of the hits of that summer. On 24 November 2008 the group released the album Afrikan New Style, a musical hybrid of African and Caribbean influences with more urban sounds. The style includes influences of zouk, dancehall, reggae, hip hop, Coupé-Décalé, ndombolo and kuduro. In December 2008, they released their second single "Mini Kawoulé". On 19 February 2010, it was announced by France Télévisions that Matador would represent France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010, to be held on 29 May 2010 in Oslo, Norway with the song "Allez Ola Olé". Jessy Matador placed 12th in the final, which was one of France's better results in the 2000s. Notes 1 Digital Download Hondal, Victor (19 February 2010).
