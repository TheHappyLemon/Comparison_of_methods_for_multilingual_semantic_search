StudioCanal S.A.S. (formerly known as Le Studio Canal+, Canal Plus, Canal+ Distribution, Canal+ D.A., and Canal+ Production, and also known as StudioCanal International) is a French film production and distribution company that owns the third-largest film library in the world. The company is a unit of the Canal+ Group, owned by Vivendi. The company was founded in 1988 by Pierre Lescure as a spin-off of the Canal+ pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and European productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies, such as Carolco Pictures. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include Terminator 2: Judgment Day, JFK, Basic Instinct, Cliffhanger, Under Siege, Free Willy, and the original Stargate movie. In those days, it was known as either Le Studio Canal+ or simply Canal+. Other films the company financed include U-571, Bully, and Bridget Jones's Diary. StudioCanal also funded the last third of David Lynch's film Mulholland Drive. StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as Brotherhood of the Wolf (which became the sixth-highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the United States) and Intimate Strangers. The biggest box office hits for StudioCanal have been Terminator 2: Judgment Day which grossed US$519 million, Basic Instinct which grossed US$352 million and The Tourist which grossed US$278 million worldwide. StudioCanal's original plan was to build up a pan-European distribution network. They made their first known acquisition into a foreign market in 1997 when they bought a 20% minority stake in Germany's Tobis Film; they would later increase the stake to 60% in February 2000, renaming the company Tobis StudioCanal. In July 2001, StudioCanal acquired a 45% stake in the Sogepaq division of Spain's Sogecable (Vivendi Universal owned 21% of Sogecable at the time) for $36.2 million, also giving the company a 73% controlling stake in its Spanish subsidiary StudioCanal España and a minority stake in the joint venture Warner Sogefilms. In October 2002, StudioCanal and BAC Majestic parted ways; the terms of the deal included the sale of Mars Distribution to StudioCanal, giving StudioCanal a film distribution arm in their homeland of France; the joint venture BAC Distribution, majority owned by StudioCanal, would shut down and revert to BAC Majestic (which at the time was suffering from financial issues). However, staff departures and its parent Vivendi Universal's debt forced StudioCanal to gradually sell off their interests in these companies: Tobis StudioCanal was subject to a management buyout by CEO Kilian Rebentrost and shareholder Pathé in December 2002 and renamed back to Tobis Film, although the two companies maintained their business relations. Sogepaq was sold back to Sogecable in July 2003 for £48 million ($54.2 million). Mars Films split from StudioCanal in 2007 to become independent; StudioCanal would later buy a 30% stake in the company in September 2015 and begin controlling its library in August 2021. StudioCanal re-entered the international market by acquiring British distributor Optimum Releasing in May 2006 as their first expansion into the United Kingdom. A year later, Optimum Home Entertainment and Lionsgate UK acquired Elevation Sales, a home entertainment sales and distribution company. In 2008, their third expansion into the international market took place with StudioCanal's acquisition of German distributor Kinowelt, who had distributed their films up to that point. Kinowelt also owned the DVD label Arthaus. Both Optimum and Kinowelt have since been merged into StudioCanal. StudioCanal's acquisition of Australian distributor Hoyts Distribution took place in 2012 and was StudioCanal's fourth expansion. In June 2016, StudioCanal acquired the intellectual rights to the Paddington Bear brand, along with the Copyrights Group, the franchise's merchandise licensing agent. StudioCanal then announced that it would be producing three more Paddington films, including a show on the Nick Jr. Channel in 2020. StudioCanal acquired film libraries from studios that either became defunct or had merged with it over the years; as a result, the company's library is one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 titles. StudioCanal owns the libraries of the following companies: Carolco Pictures The Vista Organization Seven Arts (joint venture with New Line Cinema) Paravision International Parafrance Films De Laurentiis Entertainment Group Embassy Pictures Lumiere Pictures and Television (currently owned as a result of parent company Canal+ Group's acquisition of cinema operator UGC who acquired those companies, via Weintraub Entertainment Group) EMI Films British Lion Films Individual Pictures The 1947–1955 London Films library (pre-1947 titles owned by ITV Studios) Anglo-Amalgamated Anglo-Amalgamated Film Distributors Associated British Picture Corporation ABC Weekend TV Associated British Productions British International Pictures Ealing Studios Associated Talking Pictures and Associated British Film Distributors Pathé News Welwyn Studios Almi Pictures/Television catalog Romulus Films Hammer Film Productions (distribution rights) Alexander Salkind/Pueblo Film Licensing (the non-Superman films not owned by Warner Bros.) Quad Cinema Regency Enterprises (TV rights only, France) Spyglass Entertainment (TV rights only, France, Benelux, Sweden and Poland) American Zoetrope (distribution rights) Miramax (most international home video releases; 2011–2020) (rights now held by Paramount Home Entertainment) Studio Ghibli (United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland only; ended in December 2022) (rights now held by Elysian Film Group starting with Earwig and the Witch; The Boy and the Heron is co-owned by Elysian, Bleecker Street and Anonymous Content) StudioCanal currently owns the rights to over 30 television series, mostly produced by TANDEM Productions and Red Production Company, including The Avengers, Rambo: The Force of Freedom, Paranoid, Public Eye, Crazyhead, Take Two, Wanted Dead or Alive, The Adventures of Paddington (2019), and international rights to The Big Valley. Outside France, the British Isles, Australia, New Zealand and Germany, StudioCanal does not have a formal distribution unit per se, instead relying on other distribution studios and home video distributors to handle their titles. In North America for example, The Criterion Collection, Rialto Pictures, Lionsgate Home Entertainment, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (for the Embassy catalog), Universal Pictures (for co-productions), Shout! Factory and Kino Lorber distribute StudioCanal's back catalogue on DVD and Blu-ray Disc (in addition, Anchor Bay Entertainment and Image Entertainment previously owned several of their titles). Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has handled distribution of StudioCanal/Hoyts Distribution films in Australia and New Zealand on DVD and Blu-ray since early 2013. From the 1990s to early 2000s, Warner Home Video formerly handled distribution of select StudioCanal titles through the Canal+ Image label in the United Kingdom on VHS and DVD until 2006 when StudioCanal opened its own distribution unit in the UK, with titles distributed through Optimum Releasing (via Universal Pictures Home Entertainment from 2006 to 2007 and Elevation Sales since 2007). StudioCanal had the European home video distribution rights to 550 titles from the Miramax library from 2011 to 2020, when ViacomCBS bought a minority stake in Miramax. On October 13, 2021, StudioCanal announced that its global distribution deal with Universal would expire in January 2022. Later that year, they started distributing their home media releases through Plaion Pictures in Germany. In early 2024, they started distributing their home media releases in France through ESC Distribution.
