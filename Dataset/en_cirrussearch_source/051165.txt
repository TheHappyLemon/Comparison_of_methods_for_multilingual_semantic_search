Kristīne Ulberga (born 1979) is a Latvian novelist and a winner of the Latvian Literature Annual Award (2013). Kristīne Ulberga was born in Riga in 1979. She obtained a degree in theology from the University of Latvia. Ulberga began her writing career with a young adult novel Es grāmatas nelasu (I Don't Read Books) in 2008. It was written in response to her partner's son who did not like to read in order to encourage him to do so. The debut work received the Jānis Baltvilks Prize. Two more novels in this series appeared that same year: Es grāmatas nelasu 2 and Virtuālais eņģelis (The Virtual Angel). These books were adopted into the Latvian school curriculum, and optioned for film rights. Published in 2011, Ulberga's Zaļā vārna (The Green Crow) was her first book for adults. It received the Raimonds Gerkens Prize, and the Latvian Literature Annual Award for best prose work.
