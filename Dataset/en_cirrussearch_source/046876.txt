O branco escorreu-te, Das feições, Onde moras, E onde mostras o que és! e Entre os maiores Te sentes piqueno, Mas és na Beira Rico em tradições, Agarra que te vem De seres leão, Já tem feito tremer Os aldeões! Pelos anos contados, És velhinho, Mas continuas sempre A ser um jovenzinho; D`esperança Traçaram teu carinho, Força e coragem O que te moem, O ar que te embriaga Puro e leve, Te inspira e te dá fecundidade? Que seja lema teu, Por toda a vila A grandeza, leite Gresso, A humidade A. ^A Despite finishing in a relegation position, the club was not relegated due to União de Leiria of the Primeira Liga being relegated to the non-professional tiers of Portugal due to there financial difficulties suffered during the 2011–12 Primeira Liga season.
