Trans-Continental Hustle is the fifth album by folk punk band Gogol Bordello, released on April 27, 2010. Produced by Rick Rubin, Trans-Continental Hustle primarily draws inspiration from frontman Eugene Hütz's life in Brazil, where he had been living since 2008. This album is Gogol Bordello's major record label debut. The collaboration with Rubin was initiated after guitarist Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine saw Gogol Bordello perform in Los Angeles and recommended that Rubin look into the band. "Immigraniada (We Comin' Rougher)", the fifth track on the album, has received heavy airplay on Sirius XM Radio's Faction Channel 41 as well as other genre stations. At least two of Faction's shows have played the single, including The Jason Ellis Show and Faction with Christian James Hand.[citation needed] The Band Eugene Hütz - vocals, acoustic guitar, percussion Sergey Ryabtsev - violin, backing vocals Yuri Lemeshev - accordion, backing vocals Oren Kaplan - guitar, backing vocals Thomas Gobena - bass, backing vocals Pamela Jintana Racine - percussion, backing vocals, dance Elizabeth Sun - percussion, backing vocals, dance Pedro Erazo - percussion, MC Oliver Charles - drums "Trans-Continental Hustle by Gogol Bordello".
