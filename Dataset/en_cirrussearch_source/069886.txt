Taguig (Tagalog: [taˈɡiɡ] ), officially the City of Taguig (Filipino: Lungsod ng Taguig), is the fourth-most populous city in the Philippines with a population of 1.2 million people. The city is located alongside the northwestern shores of Laguna de Bay in Metro Manila, Philippines. Taguig is known for Bonifacio Global City, one of the leading financial centers of the Philippines. Originally a fishing village during the Spanish and American colonial periods, it experienced rapid growth when former military reservations were converted by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) into financial centers and mixed-use planned communities. Taguig became a highly urbanized city with the passage of Republic Act No. 8487 in 2004, which was ratified by a plebiscite. The city covers about 54.04 square kilometers (20.86 sq mi). It is located in the southeastern portion of Metro Manila and bordered by Pasig and Pateros to the north, Makati and Mandaluyong to the northwest, Pasay and Parañaque to the west, Taytay, Rizal to the northeast and Muntinlupa to the south. The original farmer-fishermen of the area, about 800 in number, were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence, they were referred to as "mga taga-giik" (Tagalog for "rice thresher") and the settlement as "pook ng mga taga-giik" (lit. transl. place of the rice threshers). Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador Ruy López de Villalobos who crossed the Pasig River to reach the city's present site in 1571, found "taga-giik" difficult to pronounce. "Tagui-ig" was later shortened to its current form "Taguig". It is also spelled as "Tagig" or "Tagui". Before the Spaniards came, Taguig was a stablished Tagalog settlement with Moro and Chinese present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China's Ming dynasty. Taguig was one of the earliest known territories of the Provincia de Tondo, that became the Provincia de Maynila to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the Legazpi expedition in 1571. Between the years 1573 and 1587, Taguig was an encomienda under Captain Cervantes y Vergara with 3,200 inhabitants paying 1,879 and 1/2 tax. On September 04, 1584, Melchor De Ribera of the Augustian Order became the 1st non-resident Vicar of Taguig. Taguig was established as a separate "pueblo" (town) on April 4, 1587, "Tomamos de nuevo la casa de Tagui", when the Augustinian Order reaccepted the vote of the convent of Taguig during a meeting of the Augustinian Chapter in Intramuros according to Friar Gaspar de San Agustin. This is after the local Chinese community burned the old church made out of sawali in 1586. Juan Basi, a nephew of Lakan Dula and son-in-law of the Sultan of Brunei, was the Lakan of Taguig from 1587 to 1588 who participated in the Tondo Conspiracy of 1587, an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. According to records, Taguig had nine barrios then, namely: Bagumbayan, Bambang, Hagonoy (Hagunoy), Palingon (Palingong), Santa Ana, Tipas, Tuktukan (Toctocan), Ususan, and Wawa (Uaua). Santa Ana was then the municipal center (poblacion) of Taguig. There was an attempt to transfers Tipas from Taguig to Pasig because the residents of that barrio dislike the Cura or Parish Priest stationed at Taguig during that time. They raised it to the Gobernadorcillo (Leader and Judge) at that time, he said for the issue to be resolve the bells from Taguig and Pasig will be ring simultaneously. Which of these bells should be heard in Tipas will be town where it belongs to. The Bells of Taguig prevailed, that's why Tipas remained to be within the Jurisdiction of Taguig. Records also shows that Tipas had several attempts petitioning to become an independent town but was denied during the Spanish and American governments. During that time, Taguig was accessible via the Pasig River, which was connected to two large bodies of water, Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and "sawali" from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. When the Katipunan was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo on August 6, 1898. Santiago Bonifacio, the father of revolutionary Andres Bonifacio, hailed from Ligid Tipas. Barrio Tipas, specifically the Napindan Lighthouse in Barrio Napindan became a meeting place and staging point of some revolutionary attacks against Spanish forces by the Katipunan. In the 1880 up to 1919, flood water submerged almost all the lower portion of Taguig from Napindan to Bagumbayan during the months of August up to October. The Hacenderos of Maysapan and Taguig proposed to transfer the Town center and church to a higher place now part of Fort Bonifacio. The Parish Priest also supported the move and ordered to ready a parcel of land to be ready to build a new church to house the convent. However, since the local population of Taguig, during that time, are farmers and fishermen, the decision to move the town center and church was not that popular to them. They don't want move out away from their farmland and to the river leading them to the bay. The remnant of the church are still visible until the 1970's. The place was called "Bahay Pari" (Priest House). During the American occupation, Taguig natives fought against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1899, Filipino forces including Taguig "revolutionarios" dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of Pateros and Fort Bonifacio. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly. The defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General Wesley Merritt as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act No. 137 on June 11, 1901. On October 12, 1903, Taguig, Muntinlupa and Pateros were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government. The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was segregated from it and made part of Biñan, La Laguna when Act. No. 1008 was enacted on November 25, 1903. However, it was returned to Taguig on March 22, 1905, with the promulgation Act No. 1308. Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig by January 1, 1909 and Muntinlupa was granted an independent municipality status on December 17, 1917. It was also during the American Colonial Period that the United States government acquired a 25.78 km2 (9.95 sq mi) property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort William McKinley, named after the 25th president of the U.S. who was responsible for the American colonization of the Philippines. When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the Japanese Imperial Army. They occupied the military camp until the end of World War II in 1945. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, the US relinquished to the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, Fort William McKinley was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed Fort Bonifacio after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio. When President Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law in 1972, Taguig, which contained Fort Bonifacio, became the host of two detention centers full of political prisoners - the Maximum Security Unit (where Senators Jose W. Diokno and Benigno Aquino Jr. were detained) and the Ipil Reception Center (sometimes called the Ipil Detention Center). A third facility, the Youth Rehabilitation Center (YRC), was still treated as part of Fort Bonifacio but was later turned into the Makati City Jail. These detention centers became infamous for the numerous human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship, including warrantless detention and torture. Ipil was the largest prison facility for political prisoners during martial law. Among the prisoners held there were some of the country's leading academics, creative writers, journalists, and historians including Butch Dalisay, Ricky Lee, Bienvenido Lumbera, Jo Ann Maglipon, Ninotchka Rosca, Zeus Salazar, and William Henry Scott. After Fort Bonifacio was privatized, the area in which Ipil was located became the area near S&R Membership Shopping - BGC and MC Home Depot, near 32nd Street and 8th Avenue in Bonifacio Global City. In 1974, the name of Taguig's political subdivisions was changed from "barrios" to "barangays" following the nationwide implementation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) under Presidential Decree No. 557. The IRP increased Taguig's administrative divisions to 18 barangays, namely: Bagong Tanyag, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada Tipas, Hagonoy, Ibayo Tipas, Ligid Tipas, Lower Bicutan, Maharlika, Napindan, Palingon Tipas, Signal Village, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Upper Bicutan, Ususan, Wawa, and Western Bicutan. On November 7, 1975, Taguig seceded from the province of Rizal to become part of the newly formed the National Capital Region through Presidential Decree No. 824. In 1986, President Ferdinand Marcos issued Proclamation No. 2475, which transferred control of the Fort Bonifacio area to Makati and reserved the area for military personnel and their dependents. The Municipality of Taguig then contested the presidential proclamation, which resulted in a territorial dispute with Makati. In 1998, a law was enacted, pushing for the cityhood of Taguig. The resulting plebiscite on April 25, 1998 showed that the citizens were against the cityhood. A recent petition to the Supreme Court sought a recount of the plebiscite and on February 19, 2004, the Supreme Court ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the majority of residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city, with 21,105 'yes' and 19,460 'no'. Subsequently, Taguig became a city on December 8, 2004. In 2008, the Taguig City Council created ten new barangays – Central Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, North Signal Village, South Signal Village, South Daanghari, North Daanghari, Pinagsama, San Miguel, and Tanyag – by virtue of City Ordinance Nos. 24–27, 57–61, 67–69, and 78, Series of 2008, carving them out from the initial 18 barangays. After a successful plebiscite in December 2008, the creation was approve, thus the number of barangays in the city was increased from 10 to 28. In 2011, during 424th foundation day, Mayor Lani Cayetano took pride in calling the city a “ProbinSyudad” (a portmanteau of Tagalog words of Spanish origin probinsya and syudad) because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city and of a province, what with its more than 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of pagtutulungan (transl. cooperation) is still very much alive. In March 2020, the city recorded its first case of COVID-19, a lawyer who works at Bonifacio Global City and has a history abroad of travelling to Japan. The city’s response was widely regarded as successful, as it attained one of the lowest active cases per 100,000 population. It is also one of the local government units with the lowest case fatality rates in the country. Furthermore, the city focused on helping businesses when the economy reopens. The decades-long territorial dispute with Makati was ruled with finality in favor of Taguig in April 2023. The jurisdiction over ten Embo barangays were transferred from Makati to Taguig later that year. The city gained an increase in territory and in population. However, ownership issues regarding public facilities such as schools, health centers, parks, etc. still persists. Taguig is located on the northwestern shores of Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines. The Pasig River and its tributary, the Taguig River, run through the northern half of the city, while the Napindan River, another tributary of Pasig, forms the natural border between Taguig in Pasig. A relatively small area of the city called Ibayo Napindan is located north of the river, adjoining the disputed territories between Pasig, Taguig, and Taytay in Rizal Province. According to the cadastral map of Taguig, the boundary and jurisdiction limit of Taguig is the Rio del Pueblo now called Tapayan River, a tributary of the Pasig River from Barangay Pinagbuhatan, Pasig to Barangay Santa Ana, Taytay, Rizal. The city has an area of 54.048 square kilometers (20.868 sq mi), now including the Embo barangays previously from Makati. Taguig is politically subdivided into 38 barangays. These barangays were group into two congressional districts, with each district being represented by a congressman in the House of Representatives. The ten Embo barangays are the latest addition to its jurisdiction after the city won against its territorial dispute with Makati, increasing the city's territory and population. Those barangays, however, still remain with Makati's 2nd congressional district. Taguig–Pateros's Lone Congressional District (District I) (2020 population: 484,906) covers the eastern half of the city, including the entirety of the Municipality of Pateros. The district covers an area of 20.61 square kilometers (7.96 sq mi) and includes the barangays of Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada, Hagonoy, Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Lower Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Napindan, Palingon, San Miguel, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Ususan and Wawa. Taguig's Lone Congressional District (District II) (2020 population: 467,043) covers the western portion of the city, excluding the ten Embo barangays. It covers an area of 24.6 square kilometers (9.5 sq mi). Taguig, Makati and Pateros have fought over the jurisdiction of Fort Bonifacio and nearby places. In 2003, the Pasig Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled that Fort Bonifacio and Pinagsama belong to Taguig. In 2011, it also ruled that the Embo barangays (i.e., Cembo, South Cembo, East Rembo, West Rembo, Comembo, Pembo, Rizal, Pitogo, Post Proper Northside, and Post Proper Southside) are part of Taguig since they were formerly part of the military reservation. Pateros also claims such barangays, parts of Taguig and Fort Bonifacio, but the municipality's petition were dismissed by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeals stopped Taguig from exercising jurisdiction in the said areas in 2013. In 2017, the Court of Appeals upheld its final decision that Fort Bonifacio belongs to Taguig; it was later upheld by the Supreme Court in 2022. The Supreme Court junked the motion for reconsideration that was filed by the Makati city government to override the court's earlier decision, siding with Taguig a year later. Taguig is also involved in a dispute with Pasig and Taytay, Rizal over a large area which covers Ibayo Napindan in Napindan, barangay Pinagbuhatan in Pasig, and Lupang Arenda area in Taytay.[citation needed] Under the Köppen climate classification system, Manila has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen Am), closely bordering on a tropical savanna climate (Köppen Aw). The climate of Taguig is characterized by two types of season: dry season from November to April, and wet season from May to October. Rainfall is less evenly distributed. Together with the rest of the Philippines, Taguig lies entirely within the tropics. According to the 2020 census, the population of the Taguig was 886,722, making it the seventh most populous city in the Philippines, and the fourth most populous city in Luzon. Following the Makati–Taguig territorial dispute, the city gained ten additional barangays from Makati, thus increasing its population to 1,223,595 as of the 2020 census, making it the fifth most populous city in the Philippines, surpassing Zamboanga City and Cebu City. Taguig has an average household size of five (5), while 43.3% of its population are married. Majority of the city's residents are Roman Catholics. All Roman Catholic churches in the city are under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pasig, with the exception of the five parishes of the Embo barangays, which are under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila due to having been previously under the civil jurisdiction of Makati. Catholicism in the military and police areas of the city is under the jurisdiction of the Military Ordinariate of the Philippines. The headquarters of Victory, an Evangelical Christian church, is located in Bonifacio Global City. The city is notable for being the birthplace of Felix Manalo, the founder of Iglesia ni Cristo.
