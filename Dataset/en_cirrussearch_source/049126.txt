The Korolistskali (Georgian: ყოროლისწყალი, alternative name Karolitskhali) is a river by the East coast of the Black Sea, near Batumi, Georgia. Between 1907 and 1915, during the period of Tsarist Russia, pioneering Russian photographer Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky took a self-portrait on the Korolistskali River - it is one of the earliest colour photographs ever taken.
