A rescuer in a fire department is very different between western and eastern cultures. North American departments have their rescuers mix within normal fire fighters. They share the same equipment and pointed[clarification needed] as the leader during a rescue mission. Rescuers have classroom and field training with senior rescue members. Only time when a groups of rescuers are in teams are during water rescue, air rescue, mountain rescue, or a major disaster. Asian departments form special units of rescuers. These rescuers have their own equipment, apparatuses, or even their own fire stations. They would have served as a firefighter before they have training to be a rescuer.
