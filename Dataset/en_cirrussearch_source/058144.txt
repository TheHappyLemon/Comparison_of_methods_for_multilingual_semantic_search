On 4 February 2017, Wijndal made his first-team debut for AZ, starting in a 4–2 home loss to PSV Eindhoven in the Eredivisie due to injuries to regular starter Ridgeciano Haps and backup Thomas Ouwejan. The end of the 2016–17 season saw AZ end on sixth place and thereby qualifying for domestic play-offs for participation in the third qualifying round of the Europa League the following season. They eventually missed out on European football, losing to FC Utrecht on penalties after two legs.

During the 2017–18 season, Wijndal featured in the first-team side more regularly, making seven league appearances. For the newly promoted reserves, he made 16 appearances and scoring two goals. At the end of the season he signed a new five-year deal with AZ on 22 June 2018. After struggling to break into the first team during the 2018–19 season, he began playing as a regular starter during the 2019–20 season. On 25 July 2019, Wijndal also made his debut in the Europa League in a 0–0 home draw against Swedish club BK Häcken. He scored his first professional goal on 7 March 2020 in a 4–0 league win over ADO Den Haag. Ahead of the 2021–22 season, Wijndal was made captain of AZ following the departure of Teun Koopmeiners. On 12 July 2022, he joined Eredivisie club Ajax from AZ on a five-year deal for €10 million. He made his debut on 30 July, starting in the Johan Cruyff Shield against PSV. Wijndal made two assists and was replaced by Calvin Bassey in the 62nd minute. Ajax went on to lose by 5–3. On 5 September 2023, Ajax sent Wijndal on a season-long loan to Belgian Pro League reigning champions Royal Antwerp. Born in the Netherlands to a Dutch father and Surinamese mother, Wijndal is eligible for both Suriname and Netherlands. He has represented the Netherlands at every age group from under-15 to under-21 level. Between 2015 and 2016, he made 12 appearances for the Netherlands under-17 team, and participated in the 2016 UEFA European Under-17 Championship in Azerbaijan where he made five appearances. The Dutch team made the semi-finals, where they stranded against Portugal. Wijndal was a regular starter for the Netherlands under-19 team between 2016 and 2018, making 16 appearances for the team.
