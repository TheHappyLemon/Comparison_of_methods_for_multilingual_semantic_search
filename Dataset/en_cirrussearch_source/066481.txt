The Cambodia national association football team represents Cambodia in association football, and is administered by the Football Federation of Cambodia (FFC). Following its failure to qualify for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, Cambodia participated in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification first round where it beat Pakistan 4–1 on aggregate over two legs to reach the second round being drawn with Hong Kong, Bahrain, Iraq and Iran. On 5 September 2019 in the first fixture, Cambodia obtained a 1–1 draw at home to Hong Kong, 5 days later, it lost against Bahrain 1–0. In August 2020, Félix Dalmás left their post after completing their contract while on 7 April 2021, fellow countrymen, Ryu Hirose was unveiled as the new head coach of the Cambodia taking the team whenever manager Keisuke Honda is unavailable. Hirose task is to guide Cambodia for the remaining matches of the second round qualifiers of the FIFA 2022 World Cup qualification. Cambodia went on to undergo 2 defeats to Iran, their worst ever defeat, 14–0 on 10 October 2019 and then 10–0 on 11 June 2021 seeing Cambodia picking up a solitary point in its group. Honda and Hirose would left the national team following 2022 AFF Championship exit. Dalmás would be re-appointed again as the head coach. On the first round of 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification, Cambodia were drawn against Pakistan again like in the previous qualification. However Cambodia failed to qualify to the second round this time, as they were defeated 1–0 on aggregate. In 2024, FIFA invited Cambodia to the 2024 FIFA Series tournament where they faced Equatorial Guinea and Guyana respectively. From 2010 to 2022, the home kit was a blue and black shirt with black shorts and blue socks; while the original away kit was all white with a series of horizontal red stripes on the shirt. FBT sponsored this version of the kit. On May 27, 2022, the team announced its new kit collection. The Khmer sportswear company, Varaman established in February 2022 sponsored them with designs by HCD football agency Clan United. The designs are based upon the flag of Cambodia, with the blue and red tones from the flag featured along with a pattern made from pixelated images of Angkor Wat. The 2022 home shirt uses a 3 toned blue digital camouflage design. The away shirt is all white fabric, with a zoomed in section of the pattern decorated in faint blue and red tones whilst being separated by patterns and shapes. To match each set, the goalkeeper kits are red and blue for home and away respectively. The repeated element is "slightly off-coloured" from the base fabric. The training kits are blue, red, and white with a graffiti styled pattern on each.
