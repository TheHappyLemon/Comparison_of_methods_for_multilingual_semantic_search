EuroBasket 2013 was the 38th edition of the EuroBasket championship that was organized by FIBA Europe. It took place from 4 September until 22 September 2013 in Slovenia. The number of participating teams was 24. France defeated Lithuania in the final to win their first title. Tony Parker was named the tournament's MVP. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy and Slovenia brought forward a potential candidature for the FIBA EuroBasket. Countries which were interested in submitting a formal candidature had to do so by 31 August 2010. On 5 September 2010, it was announced that only two countries, Slovenia and Italy had submitted formal bids. On 15 October 2010, Italy announced its withdrawal from the run. The Basketball Federation of Slovenia (BFS) thus remained the only candidate organizer. The decision on the candidacy was officially reported after FIBA Europe's meeting in Munich, Germany on 5 December 2010. In March 2011, the BFS appointed the economist Aleš Križnar as the director of the event. In the first stage, every team had to play against every other team of their group (round-robin). This meant five matches per team. From every group, the three best teams advanced to the second stage and the three worst teams were eliminated. In the second stage, two new groups were formed. The three best teams from groups A and B were united to form group E and the three best teams from groups C and D were united to form group F. In these two new groups of the second stage only matches by teams that had not yet played each other have to be played. As for the matches that had already happened in the first stage, their results also counted in the second stage. Therefore, every team played three matches and there are 12 teams in the second stage. Out of the second stage, the four best teams from each of the two groups advanced to the quarterfinals (8 teams in total) whereas the two worst teams will be eliminated from the championship (four teams in total). The fee that Slovenia had to pay to FIBA Europe amounted to 6 million euros. According to the agreement, half of the money was paid by the Slovenian state. The official mascot was Lipko, whose name came from combining the Slovenian word for linden tree and the diminutive "ko". The word lipa is of Slavic origin. Lipko is spelt the same in every language and in every market where he is present. Slovenia already beat record attendance of 155,336 after preliminary round for almost 20,000 more people from previous FIBA Eurobasket. The average attendance per game was 2,588 visitors. On 24 March 2011, it was officially announced that the preliminary round would be played in Novo Mesto, Jesenice, Koper and Ptuj. Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, will host the final round at the Arena Stožice. On 18 June 2012, it was announced that the city council of Ptuj cancelled their bid for the tournament. Novo Mesto cancelled their bid on 2 July 2012. On 28 August 2012, it was confirmed that the preliminary round would be played in Celje and Ljubljana (Tivoli Hall) instead of Ptuj and Novo Mesto, which cancelled their bids.
