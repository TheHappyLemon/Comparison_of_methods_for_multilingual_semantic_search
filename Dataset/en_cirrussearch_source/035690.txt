Brendon Boyd Urie (born April 12, 1987) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician who is best known as the former lead vocalist and frontman of Panic! at the Disco, the only constant member throughout the band's 19-year run. Many of his songs have achieved commercial success, reaching high spots on Billboard charts and millions of sales. On January 24, 2023, Urie announced that he would be discontinuing Panic! at the Disco, since he and his wife are having a child. He currently plays drums in a band led by Mike Viola. Urie was born in St. George, Utah, and his family moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, when he was two years old. He is the fifth and youngest child born to Boyd and Grace Urie. He is of about one quarter Polynesian descent from Hawaii, through his mother's side. He was raised in an LDS family but renounced his faith around 17 due to displeasure with the church and not believing in its ideology. Urie attended Palo Verde High School in Las Vegas, where he met future Panic! bassist Brent Wilson in his guitar class. Wilson asked Urie to try out for a band he was in, since they needed a replacement guitarist. Urie described himself as a "spaz in high school," and explained that one student would always bully him. He worked at Tropical Smoothie Cafe in order to pay his band's rent for their practice space. At the cafe, Urie often sang for customers. Urie graduated high school in 2005. "I would sing anything I was listening to at the time, but I was down to take requests. I remember singing some Scorpions songs. Some W.A.S.P. 80s anthems are usually good for tips. It was a huge range of stuff. Some people liked it, and some people didn't. I had to respect other people's wishes, but I had a couple people come in who would ask me to sing for a tip. That's always fun." – Brendon Urie recalls his experience working at Tropical Smoothie Cafe (March 22, 2011) Urie met Brent Wilson while taking guitar classes offered at their high school, and Wilson asked Urie to try out as lead guitarist for Panic! at the Disco, as they were looking for a replacement at the time. Originally, Ryan Ross was their lead singer. When Urie filled in for Ross during a band rehearsal, they were impressed with Urie's vocal abilities and he was chosen as their lead singer. He officially joined the band in 2004. Since then, Panic! at the Disco has released seven studio albums with Urie as lead vocalist. A Fever You Can't Sweat Out was released in 2005 with the hit lead single "I Write Sins Not Tragedies" propelling it to 1.8 million sales. For their second album, Pretty. Odd. (2008), Urie also took lyrical responsibility and wrote two of the tracks on the record by himself: "I Have Friends in Holy Spaces" and "Folkin' Around". He also wrote "New Perspective" for the soundtrack to the motion picture Jennifer's Body. On March 22, 2011, the band released their third album Vices & Virtues following the departure of Ross and Walker. On October 8, 2013, the fourth album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die! was released. It debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. On July 21, 2014, Urie won "Best Vocalist" at the Alternative Press Music Awards. In 2015, founding drummer Spencer Smith left the band and bassist Dallon Weekes departed from the official lineup, being downgraded to a touring member, leaving Urie as the only member of the official lineup. On January 15, 2016, Panic! at the Disco released their fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor, eventually earning the band its best sales week and first number one album. On March 21, 2018, the band released two new songs "Say Amen (Saturday Night)" and "(Fuck A) Silver Lining". At the same time, the band also announced a tour, and a new album called Pray for the Wicked. On June 6, 2022, Panic! at the Disco announced their seventh studio album Viva Las Vengeance and released the title single along with announcing a tour. On January 24, 2023, Urie announced that he would be discontinuing Panic! at the Disco in order to focus on his family following the conclusion of the Viva Las Vengeance Tour. Urie provided guest vocals alongside Patrick Stump on The Cab's song "One Of THOSE Nights" from their debut album, Whisper War. Urie has also been involved with several songs and other projects by former labelmates Fall Out Boy. He provided vocals on the songs "What a Catch, Donnie" and "20 Dollar Nose Bleed" from Fall Out Boy's 2008 album, Folie à Deux. Urie also sang back vocals on the track "7 Minutes In Heaven" off of Fall Out Boy's From Under The Cork Tree. In 2008, Urie became involved with a song for the Coca-Cola Company, called "Open Happiness". Urie sings the chorus of the song, which also features labelmate Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy, labelmate Travis McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, Cee-Lo Green, and Janelle Monáe. The song was written and produced by Butch Walker, co-written by Cee-Lo Green and remixed by Polow Da Don. Urie was also featured as an elated news reporter in the music video for the song, which was released on July 16, 2009. Urie appeared in the music videos "A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More Touch Me," "What A Catch, Donnie" and "Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet" by Fall Out Boy. Urie appears in the Gym Class Heroes video for the song "Clothes Off!!" alongside former Panic! at the Disco band members Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith and Jon Walker. The members are seen dancing in animal costumes, Urie being in a dog suit. Urie also appears in "One of THOSE Nights" by The Cab, which also features Ryan Ross, Jon Walker, Pete Wentz, Patrick Stump and Spencer Smith. In 2010 Urie and bandmate Spencer Smith appeared in Butch Walker's music video "Pretty Melody", appearing as ninjas. Urie and Smith also appeared in Butch Walker's Panic! at Butch Walker's, a parody in which Urie discovers Walker is a psychotic homicidal cannibal. In 2011, Urie co-wrote a song with Rivers Cuomo of the band Weezer. Rivers has said that "If Panic! wants it, they have first dibs, but if not, it could work for Weezer." In December 2013, Urie sang "Big Shot" in front of Billy Joel, President Obama, and an audience, when Billy Joel received the Kennedy Center Honors. On March 24, 2014, Brendon Urie was featured on Travie McCoy's single "Keep On Keeping On" off his upcoming album Rough Waters. Urie featured on the entirety of the song "Love in the Middle of a Firefight" for Dillon Francis's album Money Sucks, Friends Rule. Francis called it his favorite track on the album. Urie also was featured on the Lil Dicky track "Molly" on his debut studio album Professional Rapper. In 2016, Urie was featured on the song "It Remembers" by the band Every Time I Die, from their album Low Teens. On April 11, 2017, Urie announced that he would star in Cyndi Lauper's Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, Kinky Boots, in which he played one of the lead roles, Charlie Price. He played the role from May 26, 2017, to August 6, 2017. In 2015, Urie wrote the song "Not A Simple Sponge" for the SpongeBob SquarePants musical. The musical made its debut in Chicago in the summer of 2016 and returned to the Palace Theater on Broadway in the winter of 2017. Nickelodeon released a video in the spring of 2016 that includes details about the artists that they worked with to bring the score to life. For his contributions, Urie was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Original Score. On April 26, 2019, Urie collaborated with singer Taylor Swift and Joel Little on "Me!" which is the lead single of her seventh studio album, Lover. The song obtained commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it also charted in many other countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In 2022, Urie joined the band of friend and Viva Las Vengeance collaborator Mike Viola alongside Jake Sinclair, making the act a three-piece. Viola and Urie wrote the song "Diamonds in New York" about Adam Schlesinger, performing it on April 19, 2022. Over the summer, the band recorded together, in February 2023, the band performed in Hamburg, Germany, and on April 23, 2023, their album Paul McCarthy was released. Urie performed drums and percussion on every track of the project and is pictured in the album's cover artwork. Urie served as inspiration for the song "I Think I Thought Forever Proof." Urie appears in the music videos for Viola's songs "Scientist Alexis" and "Water Makes Me Sick", playing the drums. The band is slated to tour from September through October. Urie has cited Frank Sinatra, Queen, David Bowie, and Tom DeLonge as his biggest influences. He also cited Taylor Swift as his influence as a songwriter. Urie was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age and has since been prescribed medication for the condition. He says that he likes to be open about his mental health to his fans. In a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, Urie stated that he has synesthesia. Urie met his wife Sarah Orzechowski at one of his shows, albeit while she was in a relationship. Eight months later, Hayley Williams from Paramore brought Sarah to another of Urie's shows and reintroduced them, and they began dating in 2009. The song "Sarah Smiles" from the album Vices & Virtues was inspired by Orzechowski. After announcing their engagement in September 2011, the two married on April 27, 2013. In 2013, Urie said that he had "experimented" with men but stated, "I guess if I had to classify myself, I'd say I'm straight." In July 2018, Urie described himself as pansexual and stated, "I'm married to a woman and I'm very much in love with her but I'm not opposed to a man because to me, I like a person. If a person is great, then a person is great." Urie has been recognized for his vocal & charitable support of the LGBT community. Urie joined Twitch on September 30, 2015 and regularly livestreamed thereafter. As of January 2023, his streams had accrued more than 4 million views. In February 2017, Urie moved from Los Angeles to an undisclosed location, stating that "visits and constant harassment" from fans at his house led him to feel unsafe. In August 2022, Urie got a tattoo depicting deceased Queen singer Freddie Mercury. He also has a tattoo depicting Frank Sinatra. On January 24, 2023, Urie revealed that he and his wife were expecting a child, and that he would be discontinuing Panic! at the Disco to focus on his family. Their child was born in February 2023. Urie has been recognized for various philanthropic efforts, including his own Highest Hopes Foundation. He has campaigned and donated to several organizations and causes, including Planned Parenthood, the Human Rights Campaign, SisterSong and Everytown for Gun Safety, and several youth group organizations. In June 2018, Urie pledged $1 million in partnership with GLSEN to create gay–straight alliance clubs in high schools across the United States. In November 2019, he raised over $134,000 during a 24-hour charity Twitch stream. In early 2020, Urie funded the construction of a recording studio for the Henderson Boys & Girls Club. In 2020, Urie was accused by two anonymous Twitter users of having inappropriately touched, groped, or otherwise sexually harassed them when they were underage between the years 2009 and 2011. Later that summer, the Twitter hashtag #BrendonUrieSpeakUp trended as a result of those accusations and Panic! at the Disco's security manager Zack Hall being accused of sexual misconduct and physical abuse. Urie was also criticized on Twitter for past remarks that have been perceived as racist or transphobic, including a joke about rape—which, made during a live performance over 10 years ago, initially received positive reception. After several months, Urie appeared on a livestream to announce that Hall was no long working with the band, though he received criticism for stating he would remain close friends with him. Urie apologized and announced that all of his crew members will receive anti-harassment training. Urie stated "I can’t tell you how sorry I am to those that have been hurt and to those who have had to wait while I took the time I needed to listen and just learn" while also denouncing the allegations against himself as "entirely untrue". Urie has received criticism for lip-syncing the N-word to a rap song and for stating "I wish I was born Black, so I could wear the clothes I wear without getting made fun of." Urie has received criticism for a comment about Caitlyn Jenner and for his casual use of the word "tranny", which he has since apologized for. "Roses" did not enter the NZ Top 40 Singles Chart, but peaked at number 10 on the NZ Hot Singles Chart. "Roses" did not enter the Swedish Singellista Chart, but peaked at number five on the Swedish Heatseeker Chart. Beaumont, Mark (January 13, 2016).
