The 2023–24 UEFA Champions League is the 69th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 32nd season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. The final will be played at the Wembley Stadium in London, England. The winners of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League will automatically qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League league phase and earn the right to play against the winners of the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League in the 2024 UEFA Super Cup. They will also qualify for the final of the brand-new 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the expanded 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. This edition is the final season with the current format of 32 teams participating in the group stage, after UEFA had announced that a new expanded format would be introduced for the following edition. Manchester City are the defending champions, having won their first title in the previous edition. A total of 78 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations are set to participate in the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein, which does not organise a domestic league and Russia). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: Associations 1–4 each have four teams qualify. Associations 5–6 each have three teams qualify. Associations 7–15 (except Russia) each have two teams qualify. Associations 16–55 (except Liechtenstein) each have one team qualify. The winners of the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League and 2022–23 UEFA Europa League are each given an additional entry if they do not qualify for the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league. For the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, the associations are allocated places according to their 2022 UEFA association coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 2017–18 to 2021–22. The team allocation reflects Russia's ongoing suspension from UEFA competitions. Apart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations may have additional teams (a maximum of 5 per association) participating in the Champions League, as noted below: (UEL) – Additional berth for UEFA Europa League title holders The following is the default access list for the 2023–24 season.

In the knockout phase, teams play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows: In the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight group runners-up were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association could not be drawn against each other. In the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association can be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals are held together before the quarter-finals are played, the identity of the quarter-final winners is not known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw is also held to determine which semi-final winner is designated as the "home" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it is played at a neutral venue). The draw for the round of 16 was held on 18 December 2023, 12:00 CET. The first legs were played on 13, 14, 20 and 21 February, and the second legs were played on 5, 6, 12 and 13 March 2024.
