Trip at Knight is the fourth studio album by American rapper and singer Trippie Redd. It was released on August 20, 2021, through 1400 Entertainment and 10k Projects. The album features guest appearances from SoFaygo, Drake, Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti, Ski Mask the Slump God, Polo G, Lil Durk, Babyface Ray, Sada Baby, and Icewear Vezzo; alongside late rappers Juice Wrld and XXXTentacion. Trippie Redd embarked on a tour in support for the album just days after its release. It is a spin-off to his debut studio album Life's a Trip (2018). Trippie Redd released the lead single for the album, "Miss the Rage", a collaboration with American rapper Playboi Carti, on May 7, 2021. This was followed by the second single "Holy Smokes", featuring American rapper Lil Uzi Vert on July 16, 2021. "Captain Crunch" featuring Sada Baby, Babyface Ray, and Icewear Vezzo, "MP5" featuring SoFaygo", and "Matt Hardy 999" featuring Juice Wrld were all sorted as singles with the Trip at Knight cover on streaming services, with two receiving music videos Kyann-Sian Williams of NME gave Trip at Knight 3 out of 5, saying that while Trip at Knight has "embrace[d] the colourful production of hyper-pop", the album experiences "a lack of quality control". Williams believes that Trippie should "slow down and focus on longevity". When comparing Trip at Knight and Life's a Trip, Williams believes that Trip at Knight doesn't "tend to reward repeat listens" while Life's a Trip does. Notes Although "Betrayal" featuring Drake was originally listed by Trippie Redd as part of the tracklisting, the song was not part of the album upon its initial release. However, Betrayal was later released in the complete edition of Trip at Knight on August 21, 2021. In addition, "Molly Hearts" and "Super Cell" were originally listed on Trippie Redd's announcement as "Molly Heart" and "Supercell", respectively. “Danny Phantom” is a reworked version of Trippie's and X's "Ghost Busters", which was released 3 days after XXXTentacion's murder. The new version is backed by a new “rage” style instrumental and doesn’t contain the original’s verses from Quavo and Ski Mask the Slump God. Similar to ”Danny Phantom”, ”Matt Hardy 999” is a reworked version of Trippie and the late Juice Wrld's collaboration on a previously leaked song. The new version is also, a hyper/rage style instrumental. Hoffman, Tim (August 20, 2021). "Album Review: Trippie Redd plummets with Trip at Knight". Riff Magazine. Retrieved August 20, 2021.
