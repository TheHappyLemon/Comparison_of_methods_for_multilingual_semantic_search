Competing in three Winter Olympics, he finished fourth in the men's skeleton event at Vancouver in 2010 and Sochi in 2014. Dukurs' best finish at the FIBT World Championships was 3rd in the men's skeleton event at Winterberg in 2015. His younger brother Martins is also a skeleton racer. Both he and his brother made the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Olympics. In November 2017 Sochi gold medalist Alexander Tretiakov was disqualified by the IOC and his medal stripped from him, however, a decision on, whether Tomass Dukurs is granted a bronze medal, has not been made by the IBSF. Eventually, IBSF restored the gold medal for Tretiakov. Tomass and Martins are coached by their father, Dainis Dukurs, a former bobsleigh brakeman, manager of the Sigulda sledding track and sled designer. 2002 men's skeleton results Tomass Dukurs at the Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing Skeletonsport.com profile Withers, Tom (19 February 2010).
