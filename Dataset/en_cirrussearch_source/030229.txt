Fernando Escartín Coti (born 24 January 1968) is a Spanish former road racing cyclist. Between 1995 and 2000 he came in the top 10 of the Tour de France five times and in that same time period finished on the podium in 2nd place at the Vuelta a España, twice. Escartín was born in Biescas, Aragon. Escartín won a stage and finished third overall in the 1999 Tour de France. Of the cyclists who finished on the podium in the era in which Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times (1999–2005), Escartín is the sole rider not to be implicated in a doping scandal. In response to the Armstrong doping scandal, Escartin stated, "Lance Armstrong remains the 1999 Tour winner, second Zulle and third, me... It's 13 years now since this all happened. It seems completely illogical and unreal. I don't want to even think about it." Escartín was, however, one of the names involved with the Giardini Margherita Raid where prescriptions for banned substances were found, handwritten by sports doctors. Escartín rode his last race at a criterium in Llobregat on 4 November 2002, before retiring from professional cycling. He has worked as a race co-designer for the Vuelta a España since retirement. 1993 1st Gran Premio de Náquera 1st Stage 5 Tour of Galicia 2nd Trofeo Luis Ocaña 3rd Overall Tour de Suisse 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 3rd Klasika Primavera 9th Overall Critérium International 10th Overall Vuelta a España 1994 1st Clásica a los Puertos de Guadarrama 2nd Overall Volta a Catalunya 7th Subida al Naranco 8th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 9th Overall Vuelta a España 1995 1st Overall Vuelta a Aragón 1st Stage 3 1st Overall Vuelta a los Valles Mineros 1st Stage 1 1st Clásica de Sabiñánigo 2nd Subida al Naranco 3rd Klasika Primavera 6th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 6th Overall Critérium International 7th Overall Tour de France 10th Overall Tour de Suisse 1996 1st Clásica a los Puertos de Guadarrama 2nd Overall Vuelta a Asturias 3rd Road race, National Road Championships 6th Overall Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré 6th Overall Euskal Bizikleta 7th Subida al Naranco 8th Overall Tour de France 10th Overall Vuelta a España 1997 1st Overall Volta a Catalunya 1st Stage 6 2nd Overall Vuelta a España 3rd Overall Vuelta a Asturias 1st Stage 2 3rd Overall Vuelta a Burgos 5th Overall Tour de France 6th Overall Vuelta a Aragón 9th Overall Escalada a Montjuïc 10th Grand Prix Navarre 1998 1st Stage 1 Vuelta a Aragón 2nd Overall Vuelta a España 3rd Overall Volta a Catalunya 1st Stage 8 4th Overall Vuelta a Burgos 5th Overall Vuelta a Castilla y León 8th Overall Euskal Bizikleta 9th Overall Vuelta a Asturias 1999 3rd Overall Tour de France 1st Stage 15 3rd Overall Vuelta a Asturias 1st Stages 4 & 5 4th Overall Euskal Bizikleta 1st Stages 3 & 5 7th Overall Volta a Catalunya 2000 2nd Clásica a los Puertos de Guadarrama 4th Overall Tour of Galicia 7th Overall Vuelta a España 10th Overall Vuelta a Burgos 7th Overall Volta a Catalunya 8th Overall Tour de France 9th Overall Vuelta a Aragón 10th Overall Euskal Bizikleta 2001 3rd Overall Volta a Catalunya 3rd Züri-Metzgete 10th Overall Vuelta a España 2002 4th GP Miguel Induráin 5th Overall Volta a Catalunya 8th Overall Giro d'Italia DNF=Did not finish Slater, Matt.
