Michał Ryszard Żewłakow (Polish pronunciation: [ˈmixaw ʐɛvˈwakɔf]; born 22 April 1976) is a Polish former footballer who played as a defender. He captained the Poland national team and is its third most capped player ever. Besides Poland, he has played in Belgium, Greece, and Turkey. Born in Warsaw in April 1976, Żewłakow spent eight years with Polonia Warsaw and broke into the first team in 1996–97. Żewłakow was loaned to Belgium's KSK Beveren in October 1998 before signing – together with his twin brother Marcin – for R.E. Mouscron for a combined fee of €485,000. Żewłakow went on to become a key player, helping the club reach the 2002 Belgian Cup final. After following coach Hugo Broos to R.S.C. Anderlecht, in his second season he made his UEFA Champions League debut as Anderlecht wrested back the Belgian title from Club Brugge. The next season, he lost his place but regained it in 2005–06 as Anderlecht won the league again. In the summer 2006, Żewłakow moved to Olympiacos on a free transfer. At the end of the 2009–10 season, Olympiacos gave Żewłakow a low offer, so he preferred not to renew his contract. On 16 June 2010 Ankaragücü signed him on a free transfer. In June 2011, Żewłakow joined Polish club Legia Warsaw on a one-year contract. The Poland national team's first-choice left-back during qualifying for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Żewłakow was the only player to appear in all ten of his country's qualifying matches. He played in two games at the 2002 World Cup and was a regular in qualifying for UEFA EURO 2004 and the 2006 World Cup, where he again appeared three times in the finals in Germany. Michał Żewłakow has a twin brother, Marcin, who played as a striker. They became the first twins ever to play together for Poland when they were picked in the starting lineup to face France in February 2000 and were teammates at the 2002 World Cup.
