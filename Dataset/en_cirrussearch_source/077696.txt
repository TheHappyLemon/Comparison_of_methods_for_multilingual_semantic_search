Uldis Pūcītis was born in Ranka parish, Gulbene District to Jānis Pūcītis and his wife Anna Pūcīte. After graduating from school in Ranka he continued his studies in Riga and studied at the Latvian State Conservatory, graduating in 1959.

Pūcītis made his film debut in a small role as a fisherman in the 1959 Ada Neretniece-directed Latvian language Soviet film Svešiniece ciemā (English release title: Stranger in the Village) before his first starring role opposite Latvian actress Vija Artmane in the Leonīds Leimanis-directed period-drama Purva bridējs, a film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Latvian writer Rūdolfs Blaumanis. He would go on to appear in a number of film and television roles throughout the 1960s and into the 1990s, as well as continuing his stage career. In 1998, Pūcītis would write the script and co-direct the television mini-series Izpostītā ligzda for Latvijas Televīzija (LTV) with Armands Zvirbulis.
