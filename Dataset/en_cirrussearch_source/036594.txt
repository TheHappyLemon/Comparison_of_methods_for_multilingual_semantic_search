Alpirsbach (German: [ˈalpɪʁsbax] ) is a town in the district of Freudenstadt in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is situated in the Black Forest on the Kinzig river, 13 kilometers (8.1 mi) south of Freudenstadt. Because of the local brewery “Alpirsbacher Klosterbräu“, the monastery with the cloister concerts and the famous movable organ, as well as the Black Forest Ultra Cycling Marathon “SURM“, Alpirsbach is well-known beyond the region. Alpirsbach developed as a market town around Alpirsbach Abbey, a Benedictine monastery founded in 1095. The monastery and its holdings were ceded to the Duchy of Württemberg by the Peace of Westphalia. In 1810, the by-then Kingdom of Württemberg made Alpirsbach the seat of a district office, but three years later it was assigned to Oberamt Oberndorf [de]. Alpirsbach received town privileges in 1869 and was connected by railroad in 1886. The township was reassigned to the district of Freudenstadt in 1938. After World War II, it began expanding along the steep mountain slopes of the Kinzig river. The township (Stadt) covers an area of 64.55 square kilometers (24.92 sq mi) of the Freudenstadt district, within the state of Baden-Württemberg and the Federal Republic of Germany. Alpirsbach is physically located in the upper Kinzig valley, in the Central Black Forest, but also in the Upper Gäu [de] at the municipal area's western extremity. The Kinzig marks the township's lowest elevation, 399 meters (1,309 ft) above sea level NN, while its highest, 800 meters (2,600 ft) NN, is in the mountainous northwest. The Glaswiesen und Glaswald [de] Federally-protected nature reserve is located within Alpirsbach. 1819–1833: Johann Georg Faßnacht ????–1848: Köstlin 1848–1850: Schliz 1857–1882: Albert Heinzelmann 1882–1889: 1889–1895: Ernst Gottlob Schöck 1895–1918: Wilhelm Rieker 1918–1926: Wilhelm Schwarz 1926–1933: Friedrich Reichert 1933–1945: Otto Rommel (NSDAP, afterwards mayor of Holzgerlingen) 1945–1948: Robert Faulhaber 1949–1967: Otto Müller (between 1938 and 1945 mayor of Holzgerlingen) 1967–1974: Hans Volle (CDU, afterwards administrative head of the district Tuttlingen) 1974–2000: Peter Dombrowsky (CDU, afterwards administrative head of the district Freudenstadt) 2000–2008: Roland Wentsch (independent) 2008–2016: Reiner Ullrich (SPD) since 2016: Michael E.
