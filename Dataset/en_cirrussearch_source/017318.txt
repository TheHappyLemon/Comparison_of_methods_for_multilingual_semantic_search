FIFA suspended Kenya from all football activities for three months in 2004, due to the interference of the government in football activities. The ban was reversed after the country agreed to create new statutes. On 25 October 2006, Kenya was again suspended from international football, for failing to fulfill a January 2006 agreement made to resolve recurrent problems in its federation. FIFA announced that the suspension would be in force until the federation complies with the agreements previously reached. Kenya qualified for the 2019 AFCON.

His absence was never explained, and Batchelor was called in as an emergency replacement. This match was the team's worst defeat, with a final score of 13–2 against Ghana.
