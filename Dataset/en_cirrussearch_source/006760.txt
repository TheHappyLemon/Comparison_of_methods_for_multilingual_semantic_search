Zebrahead, more commonly known as Yellow or The Yellow Album, is the debut studio album by American punk rock band Zebrahead. The songs "Check" and "Hate" are both re-recorded from their One More Hit demo tape released two years prior in 1996. Most of the songs on the album would end up re-recorded later and released as part of the band's follow-up and first mainstream album, Waste of Mind. The song "Check" would therefore end up re-recorded twice so far. "Check" is the only known single from the album and was accompanied by a music video. It was also featured in the soundtrack of the skateboarding video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3.
