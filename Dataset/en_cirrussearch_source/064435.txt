The Kazakh Uplands (Kazakh: Сарыарқа, Saryarqa - "Yellow Ridge", Russian: Казахский мелкосопочник, Kazakhskiy Melkosopochnik), also known as the Kazakh Hummocks, is a large peneplain formation extending throughout the central and eastern regions of Kazakhstan. Administratively the Kazakh Uplands stretch across the East Kazakhstan, Pavlodar, Akmola, Ulytau and Karaganda regions. Several notable cities, including the country's capital, Astana, are located in the uplands. There are large deposits of coal in the north and copper in the south. The Kazakh Uplands are limited by the West Siberian Plain to the north, the Irtysh valley to the northeast, the Balkhash-Alakol Basin to the south and southeast, the Turan Lowland to the southwest and by the Turgay Depression to the west. Rivers such as the Ishim, Sileti, Sarysu, Nura, Kulanotpes, Ashchysu, Tundik and Uly-Zhylanshyk have their sources in the uplands. Lake Tengiz lies in an intermontane basin of the uplands and is the largest of the area. The Kokshetau Lakes are an important tourist attraction. The uplands include mountain ranges of moderate altitude separated by elevated flat intermontane basins.
