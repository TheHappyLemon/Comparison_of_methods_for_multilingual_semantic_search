Alper is a visual artist who channels her inner anxiety, depression, trauma and other demons into vivid drawings and papier-mâché sculptures. The title comes from Alper, who says that one of the only situations in which she feels at home besides art is sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Erbland, Kate (August 30, 2017).
