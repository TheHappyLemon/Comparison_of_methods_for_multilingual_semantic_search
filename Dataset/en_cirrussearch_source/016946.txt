His father, Vernon Lindsay Vaughn, worked as a salesman for a toy company. As a child, he was raised both Protestant and Catholic by his Catholic mother and Protestant father. He has Italian, Irish, English, Lebanese, and German ancestry. Vaughn grew up in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, where he played football and baseball and wrestled, although he has called himself "unathletic" and "very average" at high school sports. He then moved to Lake Forest, where he graduated from Lake Forest High School in 1988. He was introduced to musical theater at a young age and decided to become an actor in 1987. He has credited his mother as the inspiration for his career, saying, "I saw her overcome stuff, and I thought if you worked hard at something you'd give yourself a chance". In 1988, Vaughn was cast in a Chevrolet commercial and subsequently moved to Hollywood. He appeared in the 1989 season of the television series China Beach and in three CBS Schoolbreak Specials in 1990. His first film role was 1993's Rudy as Notre Dame football tailback Jamie O'Hara. He struck up a friendship with Jon Favreau, who was also a first-time actor. Two years later, he was cast in a lead role in a proposed revival of 77 Sunset Strip that was to air on the fledgling WB Television Network, but the project ceased development after initial testing. Vaughn did not gain wider success until his role in 1996's Swingers with Favreau. Afterward, Steven Spielberg cast Vaughn in the 1997 blockbuster The Lost World: Jurassic Park, which gave him increased exposure. He followed that up with the lead role in The Locusts the same year. In 1998, he starred in the critically acclaimed drama Return to Paradise with Anne Heche, and starred in Clay Pigeons with Janeane Garofalo and Joaquin Phoenix. In 2000, he starred in The Cell with Jennifer Lopez and in 2001, appeared in Made, another film penned by Favreau. Vaughn also appeared in Dwight Yoakam's directorial debut, South of Heaven, West of Hell. Vaughn's performance in the 2003 comedy Old School increased his popularity.[citation needed] In 2004, Vaughn appeared alongside Ben Stiller in the hit films Starsky & Hutch and Dodgeball.
