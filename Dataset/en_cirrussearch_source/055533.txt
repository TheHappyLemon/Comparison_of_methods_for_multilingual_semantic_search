Logan Mathers Brown (born March 5, 1998) is an American professional ice hockey player currently playing for the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the first round, 11th overall, by the Ottawa Senators in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. He has also played with the St. Louis Blues.

Brown was returned to Windsor later in the month having posted one assist in four games with the Senators. After attending the 2018 training camp with the Senators, Brown was assigned to the team's farm team in the American Hockey League, the Belleville Senators. Brown spent almost all of the season with Belleville except for two games with Ottawa in February, in which he did not score a point. During the 2019–20 season, Brown again started with Belleville. He was recalled early in the season on October 22, 2019. He played in 23 games with Senators, primarily on the fourth line, registering one goal and eight points. He scored his first NHL goal versus the New York Rangers in a 4–1 win on November 22, 2019. He was returned to Belleville on December 28 during the holiday roster freeze in order to get him more playing time. Brown remained with Belleville until a callup in May 2021 during the 2020–21 season where he played one game with Ottawa. On September 25, 2021, Brown was traded to the St. Louis Blues along with a conditional 4th round 2022 draft pick in exchange for Zach Sanford. Brown scored his first goal with the Blues in his first appearance for the team. On February 8, 2022 he signed a one-year contract extension with the Blues. During the 2022–23 season Brown split time between St. Louis and the Blues' AHL affiliate, the Springfield Thunderbirds. He played in 30 games with St. Louis, registering two goals and eight points. He was injured in a 5–1 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers on November 8, 2022 that kept him out of the lineup until December 19, 2022. As a free agent from the Blues, Brown was signed to a one-year, two-way contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning for the 2023–24 season on July 1, 2023. Brown was placed on a long-term injury reserve to begin the season suffering from an undisclosed injury that would keep him out indefinitely.
