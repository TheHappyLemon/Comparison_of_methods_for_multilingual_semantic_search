Conrad Helmut Fritz Böcker (24 August 1870 in Leipzig – 8 April 1936 in Frankfurt) was a German gymnast. He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. Böcker had little success in individual events. He competed in the parallel bars, horizontal bar, vault, pommel horse, and rings events. In none of them was he among the medallists. He did, however, win two gold medals as part of the German team in the two team events, on parallel bars and the horizontal bar. "Conrad Böcker". Olympedia. Retrieved 20 December 2020.
