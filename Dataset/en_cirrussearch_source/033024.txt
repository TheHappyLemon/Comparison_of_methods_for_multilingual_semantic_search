EDHEC Business School (French: École des Hautes Etudes Commerciales du Nord) is a French business school (Grande École) with campus locations in: Lille, France; Nice, France; Paris, France; London, United Kingdom; and Singapore. EDHEC holds the coveted triple accreditation of EQUIS, AACSB and AMBA. According to the Financial Times, the business school consistently ranks among the top 10 European business schools and is placed third in France, after HEC Paris and ESCP. EDHEC offers its flagship Master in Management, MSc International Finance, MBA and EMBA programs, specialized MSc programs, PhD program and executive education. In 2019, EDHEC had 8,600 students enrolled in traditional graduate and undergraduate programmes, 245 exchange and double-degree agreements with many academic institutions and a network of more than 40,000 alumni in over 125 countries. EDHEC Business School was founded in 1906 by entrepreneurs from the north of France. Motte Duthoit, leading textile manufacturer and mayor of Roubaix, France, purchased the land known as “La campagne” on which EDHEC headquarters currently stand. Marcel Tiberghien, a prosperous wool industrialist from Tourcoing, and his wife Madeleine (née Vanoutryve), from a textile family from Roubaix, decided to move out of the town and house their large family in the fresh air of the countryside. The couple purchased a total of 7 hectares in Marcq-en-Baroeul and commissioned one of the greatest architects and landscapers of the time, Jacques Gréber, to design the Anglo-Norman style manor and the English gardens surrounded by century-old beech trees with a pond in the south part of the manor and a rose garden in the west part. He also built in the north part a gardener's house and a stable for three horses. Gréber is known for major projects such as the Fairmont Parkway in Philadelphia, urban plans for Montreal and Marseille, etc. The Manor now serves as a training centre for EDHEC Executive Education. "EDHEC" is originally an acronym for the French "École des Hautes Etudes Commerciales du Nord" or “School of Higher Education in Business Administration from the North”. 1906 Creation of a department for business studies at the “Ecole des Hautes Etudes Industrielles” in Lille 1921 Founding of the school under its current name « Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales du Nord » 1947 Establishment of Graduate Association, EDHEC Alumni 1958 Choice of operational framework.

Grandes écoles, like EDHEC, are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process, and a significant proportion of their graduates occupy the highest levels of French society. More than 5,000 applicants register for the approximately 380 places offered in each year's cohort as part of this selection process. Similar to Ivy League schools in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, graduation from a grande école is considered the prerequisite credential for any top government, administrative and corporate position in France. Grandes Écoles strive to meet the needs of industry and commerce. With this in mind, the majority of the instructors are recruited from industry, in addition to the permanent faculty. This keeps channels open for employment needs and opportunities once students graduate. The degrees are accredited by the Conférence des Grandes Écoles and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France). Higher education business degrees in France are organized into three levels thus facilitating international mobility: the Licence / Bachelor's degrees, and the Master's and Doctorat degrees. The Bachelors and the Masters are organized in semesters: 6 for the Bachelors and 4 for the Masters. Those levels of study include various "parcours" or paths based on UE (Unités d'enseignement or Modules), each worth a defined number of European credits (ECTS). A student accumulates those credits, which are generally transferable between paths. A Bachelors is awarded once 180 ECTS have been obtained (bac + 3); a Masters is awarded once 120 additional credits have been obtained (bac +5). The highly coveted PGE (Grand Ecole Program) ends with the degree of Master's in Management (MiM) In 2022, EDHEC Business School was ranked among the top-10 European Business Schools. EDHEC's Master in Marketing is consistently ranked among the top 10 in the world, and its Master in Finance is regularly placed within the top 5 worldwide. Furthermore, the Financial Times ranked EDHEC #1 worldwide for their Master in Finance in 2017. The Economist ranks the university 3rd in the world for its Master's in Management.
