Katarina Blagojević (née Jovanović; 31 October 1943 — 15 November 2021), also known as Katarina Blagojević-Jovanović (Serbian Cyrillic: Катарина Благојевић-Јовановић) was a Serbian chess player who held the title of Woman Grandmaster (WGM, 1986). She shared 4th–5th place in the Women's World Chess Championship Candidates Tournament in 1964.

Each sister won a Yugoslav women's national championship and played in Interzonal Tournaments.
