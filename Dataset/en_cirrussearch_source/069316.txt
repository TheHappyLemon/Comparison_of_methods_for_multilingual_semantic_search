The 2028 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as UEFA Euro 2028 or simply Euro 2028, will be the 18th UEFA European Championship, the quadrennial international football championship. England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the Republic of Ireland will host the tournament, which is scheduled to take place between June and July 2028. This will be the third time that England plays host to the event, following Euro 1996 and eight matches in Euro 2020 (including the final). It will also be the second time that fixtures will be played in Scotland, where four ties in the 2020 competition took place. Games will be held in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Wales for the first time. On 23 March 2022, UEFA announced that three proposals had been received from countries declaring an interest in hosting the tournament — a joint bid of England, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales; a bid from Turkey; and one from Russia (which was later deemed ineligible). On 4 October 2023, it was disclosed that Turkey had withdrawn its submission to focus on a joint bid with Italy for Euro 2032. On March 23, Russia also submitted a bid, despite the current UEFA ban on Russian clubs and the national team due to the country's invasion of Ukraine. On May 2, 2022, UEFA declared both of Russia's bids for 2028 and 2032 ineligible. The host was selected on 10 October 2023 in Nyon, Switzerland. The joint bid of England, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales won unanimously. Per UEFA's bid regulations, the automatic qualification of the hosts can only be guaranteed for up to two host associations. Therefore, it is unclear which host teams may qualify automatically. One plan being considered is that all five host teams (England, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales) may enter qualifying, with two automatic spots held in reserve for hosts which fail to qualify. Should three or more host teams fail to qualify, the spots would be awarded to the best-performing hosts. A qualifying tournament will take place to determine the majority of the competing teams. A revised qualification format was confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Nyon, Switzerland, on 25 January 2023. The qualification format was modified from the previous cycle. The qualifying group stage will feature twelve groups of four or five teams. The winner of each group will qualify for the European Championship, while the second-placed teams will either qualify directly or participate in play-off matches. On 12 April 2023, the ten host stadiums for the Euro 2028 bid were revealed, with the list being confirmed by UEFA on 10 October 2023. Notable omissions include Anfield, which was ineligible to host games due to its pitch dimensions falling short of UEFA's requirements, and Old Trafford, which was ruled out after Manchester United were unable to guarantee whether the stadium would be ready at that time. The inclusion of Casement Park as the Northern Irish venue created some controversy, firstly due to Casement Park not currently being available due to redevelopment work, and secondly due to its inclusion over Windsor Park. Windsor Park does not have a large enough capacity to comply with UEFA rule for hosting European Championship matches, which led to Casement Park being included as the Northern Ireland venue instead. Windsor Park, Northern Ireland's national football stadium, is located in a majority unionist area, whereas Casement Park, Northern Ireland's national stadium for hurling and Gaelic football, is in a majority nationalist area. The stadium is named in honour of Sir Roger Casement, a renowned Irish nationalist who was hanged in 1916 for his role in the Easter Rising. Some unionist Northern Ireland fans have held protests saying they do not want to attend games at the venue. New stadium. To be renovated. "UEFA EURO 2028 – Invitation to bid". UEFA Circular Letter.
