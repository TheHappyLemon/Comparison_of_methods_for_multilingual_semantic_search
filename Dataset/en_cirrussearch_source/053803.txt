Fabio Jakobsen (born 31 August 1996) is a Dutch cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Team dsm–firmenich PostNL. During the 2019 Vuelta a España Jakobsen won two stages, including the final stage of the race on stage 21 in Madrid. A few metres before the finish of the 1st stage in the 2020 Tour de Pologne he heavily crashed after Dylan Groenewegen deviated from his line, forcing Jakobsen into the barriers. The race doctor initially reported that Jakobsen had suffered several major injuries, including serious brain trauma and damage to the upper respiratory tract, a broken palate, and heavy blood loss, and was in life-threatening condition. On 7 August 2020, the race organisers announced that Jakobsen was out of the induced coma and in "good condition". On 18 August 2020, Jakobsen said that he was "glad to be alive" following the crash. Groenewegen received a nine month suspension. Jakobsen returned to professional racing at the Presidential Tour of Turkey on 11 April 2021, eight months after the crash. Jakobsen raced the 2021 Vuelta a España, where he improved on his 2019 result by winning three stages on this occasion: stages four, eight and sixteen. The early part of the race saw him battle with Jasper Philipsen for the green Points Classification jersey. Philipsen abandoned the race after stage 10 due to illness, which left Magnus Cort and overall GC contender Primož Roglič as Jakobsen's closest points rivals. However, stage 16 proved to be decisive, when Jakobsen won the sprint finish on his 25th birthday. Although he was unable to increase his points total following this stage victory, he remained the overall leader in the points competition until the completion of the race, earning him his first Grand Tour jersey. At the end of the 2021 season, Jakobsen was nominated for Comeback Rider of the Year award on CyclingnewsForum. Jakobsen won the award, gaining the majority of the votes over the other nine riders. In 2022 he won Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne, a stage in Paris-Nice and the Tour of Belgium. He also won the points classification as well as multiple stages in Volta ao Algarve, the Tour of Hungary and Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana. In the 2022 Tour de France, which was his first entry in the Tour, he won the sprint finish on stage 2. On stage 17, which was a major mountain stage with a summit finish in Peyragudes, Jakobsen's entire team returned to the finish line to cheer when they realized he was going to make it inside the time cut. He was the final surviving rider to cross the finish line, and then collapsed up against the barriers with the Broom wagon driving across the line fifteen seconds later. He survived the next day in the high mountains and the rest of the race, making his first Tour de France a successful one. 2014 4th Overall Driedaagse van Axel 2015 2nd Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships 2016 1st Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships 1st Slag om Norg 1st Stage 2 ZLM Tour 2017 1st Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships 1st Eschborn-Frankfurt City Loop U23 1st Craft Ster van Zwolle 1st Ronde van Noord-Holland Olympia's Tour 1st Stages 3 & 4 1st Stage 2 Tour de l'Avenir 1st Stage 2 Tour de Normandie 1st Stage 4 Tour Alsace 2nd Dorpenomloop Rucphen 4th Arno Wallaard Memorial 5th Slag om Norg 6th Road race, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 8th Zuid Oost Drenthe Classic 2018 (7 pro wins) 1st Scheldeprijs 1st Nokere Koerse Tour of Guangxi 1st Points classification 1st Stages 3 & 6 1st Stage 1 BinckBank Tour 1st Stage 1 Tour des Fjords 1st Stage 4 Okolo Slovenska 2nd Halle–Ingooigem 2nd Overall Hammer Hong Kong 4th Dwars door West–Vlaanderen 6th Great War Remembrance Race 10th Bretagne Classic 2019 (7) 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st Scheldeprijs Vuelta a España 1st Stages 4 & 21 1st Stage 1 Volta ao Algarve 1st Stage 3 Tour of Turkey 1st Stage 4 Tour of California 1st Overall Hammer Limburg 1st Stage 1 & 2 2nd Elfstedenronde 2020 (4) 1st Grote Prijs Jean-Pierre Monseré Volta ao Algarve 1st Points classification 1st Stage 1 1st Stage 1 Tour de Pologne 1st Stage 5 Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 4th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 2021 (7) 1st Eurométropole Tour 1st Gooikse Pijl Vuelta a España 1st Points classification 1st Stages 4, 8 & 16 Tour de Wallonie 1st Stages 2 & 5 2022 (13) 1st Road race, UEC European Road Championships 1st Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen 1st Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 1st Elfstedenronde Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana 1st Points classification 1st Stages 2 & 5 Volta ao Algarve 1st Points classification 1st Stages 1 & 3 Tour de Hongrie 1st Points classification 1st Stage 2 & 3 1st Stage 2 Tour de France 1st Stage 2 Paris–Nice 1st Stage 5 Tour of Belgium 6th Münsterland Giro 2023 (7) Tour of Belgium 1st Stages 2 & 5 Danmark Rundt 1st Stages 2 & 4 1st Stage 2 Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Stage 2 Tour de Hongrie 1st Stage 2 Vuelta a San Juan 3rd Elfstedenronde 3rd Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen 5th Classic Brugge–De Panne 6th Gooikse Pijl 9th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 2024 2nd Nokere Koerse "Quick-Step sign l'Avenir stage winner".
