The 2023 Latvian Higher League, known as the Optibet Virslīga for sponsorship reasons, was the 32nd season of top-tier football in Latvia. The season began on 11 March 2023 and ended on 11 November 2023. The winners (RFS, their second title win) qualified for the 2024–25 Champions League first qualifying round. The second-placed team (Riga) qualified for the 2024–25 Conference League second qualifying round. The third and fourth-placed teams (Auda and Valmiera) qualified for the 2024–25 Conference League first qualifying round. The ninth-placed team (Metta) qualified for the Latvian Higher League play-off. The bottom team (Super Nova) were relegated to the 2024 Latvian First League. Ten teams contest the league; the top nine clubs from the previous season, and one team promoted from 1. līga. FS Jelgava won promotion by winning the First League in 2022. After Spartaks Jūrmala failed to obtain the necessary license for participation in the league, SK Super Nova (who had been relegated) were given the chance to return to the league. Ninth-placed Metta defeated Grobiņa from the Latvian First League to retain their status in the top-flight. Valmiera entered the season as defending champions.
