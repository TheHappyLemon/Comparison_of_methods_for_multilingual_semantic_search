Putian or Putien (Chinese: 莆田, Putian dialect: Pó-chéng), also known as Puyang (莆阳) and Puxian (莆仙), historically known as Xinghua or Hing Hwa (simplified Chinese: 兴化; traditional Chinese: 興化), is a prefecture-level city in eastern Fujian province, China. It borders Fuzhou City to the north, Quanzhou City to the south, and the Taiwan Strait's Xinghai Bay to the east. The Mulan River flows through the southern part of the city. Putian was first founded as an administrative area in the year of 568 as a city county during the Chen dynasty.[citation needed] Putian was later established as a military administered city in 979. Putian is known as the counterfeit sneaker capital with counterfeiters protected from internationally intellectual property law enforcement by the notoriously corrupt local courts. Pó-chéng-uā (莆田话), a sub-dialect of Min Chinese is spoken. Putian has become an export base for Fujian products. The main industries are shoe-making, brewing, electronics, garments, fruits, vegetables, machinery and electrical goods. In particular, the area is known for high-quality counterfeits of shoes and the domination of Chinese private healthcare. Putian is known for Putian (Henghwa) cuisine, a unique style of cuisine that places a heavy emphasis on fresh seafood. Duotou clams, locally harvested around the village of Duotou, are particularly well known. Meizhou Island, most famous for being the legendary birthplace of the goddess Mazu, is located closely offshore of Putian. According to legends, Mazu in her earthly incarnation died on the seashore of Xianliang Harbor, in the coastal area of Putian, where Xianliang Mazu Temple hosts pilgrims from different Chinese provinces and from Taiwan, particularly for the ceremonies commemorating the goddess' death held in October. Because of its hosting "the most sacred places for Mazu believers," Putian is known as "Mazu's hometown."
