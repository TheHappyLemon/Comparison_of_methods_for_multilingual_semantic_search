Boban Marjanović (Serbian Cyrillic: Бобан Марјановић; born August 15, 1988) is a Serbian professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He also plays for the Serbian national team in international competitions. A 2007 junior world champion, Marjanović played abroad in Russia and Lithuania between 2010 and 2012 before making his breakthrough in his home country. As the 2013 MVP of the Serbian league, he moved to KK Crvena zvezda, with whom he won the national championship and the cross-border Adriatic Basketball League (ABA League) in 2015. In addition to further MVP awards in Serbia, Marjanović was also voted one of the five best players in the ABA League and the top European club competition EuroLeague in 2015. Marjanović signed his first ever NBA contract as a 27-year-old rookie in 2015 with the San Antonio Spurs. He also played for the Detroit Pistons, Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers and Dallas Mavericks. At 2.24 m (7 ft 4 in) tall, Marjanović is tied with Victor Wembanyama as the tallest active NBA player. Marjanović was born and raised in Boljevac in eastern Serbia. Although he was tall from a young age, his family members are all of average height: his father stands only 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) in height. A pituitary gland condition is thought to have contributed to his gigantism. Marjanović began playing basketball with the youth teams of Boljevac-based club Rtanj. By age 14 he was 2.09 m (6 ft 10+1⁄2 in) tall, and began playing for the Serbian professional team Hemofarm. He played in their youth categories until the 2005–06 season. Marjanović joined Hemofarm's first team, playing in the Adriatic League, in the second half of the 2005–06 season. He played there until January 2007 when he was loaned to the Serbian League team Swisslion Takovo. After half a season there, he returned to Hemofarm. His teammates included Stefan Marković and Milan Mačvan, with whom he had played on the Serbian junior national team. In the summer of 2010, Marjanović signed a three-year contract with CSKA Moscow, on the insistence of Duško Vujošević. After Vujošević was fired, Marjanović lost his place in CSKA's first team.
