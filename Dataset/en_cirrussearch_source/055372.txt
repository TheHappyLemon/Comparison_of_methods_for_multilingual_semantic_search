Hauerinidae is a large and diverse family of miliolid forams (Loeblich & Tappan, 1988) that includes genera distributed among various subfamilies in the Treatise (Loelich &Tappan 1964) as well as genera named and described since. Test with a proloculus commonly followed by tubular chambers, two per whorl added in one to five or more planes of coiling. Less commonly the adult test may have more than two chambers per whorl or may be uncoiled and rectilinear. The aperture may be a simple opening at the end of the final chamber, often with a tooth, or may be cribrate with multiple openings. Six subfamilies are recognized (Loeblich & Tappan, 1988) Hauerininae Miliolinellinae Simoilinitinae Sigmoilopsinae Siphonoaptertinae Tubinellinae Alfred R. Loeblich Jr and Helen Tappan, 1964.
