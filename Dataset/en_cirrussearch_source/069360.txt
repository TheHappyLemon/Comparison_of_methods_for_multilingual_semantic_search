Juris Umbraško (born 29 July 1978 in Jekabpils, Latvia) is a Latvian professional basketball coach and former player. He is the current head coach of Latvian-Estonian Basketball League team Rīgas Zeļļi. Umbraško started his senior club career with Latvijas Basketbola līga team ASK Broceni LMT and moved to European basketball powerhouse CSKA Moscow. In 2002 he came back home to represent BK Ventspils and won the Latvian Championship titles in 2002 and 2003. After unexpectedly good years abroad and in Latvia, he struggled to keep consistency in his game. He then played in Ukraine for almost 4 years, representing different teams, but achieving few success. In 2008 he returned to Latvia, but only to play episodic role in VEF Riga's Latvian League triumph. At the beginning of 2011-2012 season, the Latvian joined Estonian team BC Rakvere Tarvas with fellow Latvians Kaspars Cipruss and Rinalds Sirsniņš, the team which has been represented by many decent Latvian players: Igors Melniks, Edmunds Valeiko, Ivars Timermanis and Raimonds Vaikulis. Juris Umbraško has been a frequent member of the Latvia national basketball team. He first represented Latvia in youth level, U22 games and caught attention of the senior team staff. He was then called up to the men's squad in 2000 and played regularly until 2002, while playing in CSKA Moscow. However, his latter stints have been occasional and he has never played in any major tournament with Latvian senior team.
