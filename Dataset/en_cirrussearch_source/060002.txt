Manuel Sanchís Hontiyuelo (Spanish pronunciation: [maˈnolo sanˈtʃis]; born 23 May 1965) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a sweeper. A part of the famous La Quinta del Buitre which stemmed from the Real Madrid youth academy, he was the only of its five members to spend his entire career with the club. His father Manuel Sanchís also played for Real Madrid, and both were Spanish internationals. Sanchís appeared in more than 700 competitive matches for his only club, and represented the national team in one World Cup and one European Championship. A product of Real Madrid's prolific youth system, Madrid-born Sanchís made his debut with the first team on 4 December 1983, scoring the only goal at Real Murcia and finishing his debut campaign with a further 17 appearances (and two goals) for the main squad. Sanchís only appeared in less than 30 matches in two of the following 15 seasons, and was instrumental in the team's several conquests, including six La Liga championships, two UEFA Champions Leagues and two UEFA Cups. In 1999–2000 he featured sparingly, but still helped to their eighth European Cup, playing 11 minutes in the final against fellow Spanish side Valencia CF in a 3–0 win. Sanchís retired in 2001 at the age of 36, having played 710 official games for his only club – 523 of those in the league – while also captaining it for 13 years. After excelling with the Spanish under-21s, with which he won the 1986 UEFA European Championship, Sanchís made his senior debut on 12 November of that year in a UEFA Euro 1988 qualifier against Romania (1–0 win). He went on to earn 48 full caps, appearing at both Euro 1988 and the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Sanchís' last match was a friendly with the United States, on 11 March 1992. As a central defender, Sanchís stood out for his defensive composure, placement and agility. He set a new standard within his club due to both his sporting and human skills. An aggressive yet fair player, he was also noted for his tactical intelligence and positional sense, and usually played as a sweeper.
