At the 1904 Summer Olympics, seven wrestling events were contested, all in the freestyle discipline. Then-known as catch wrestling, it was the first time freestyle wrestling was featured, as the first Olympic wrestling contests had been in the Greco-Roman style. Weight classes also made their first appearance. The sport continues to be in the Olympic program to the present day. The event doubled as that year's Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) Catch Wrestling Championships, although five nations were represented, each of the 42 competitors resided in the US A total of 43 wrestlers competed at the St. Louis Games:  United States (38)  Norway (2)  Canada (1)  Germany (1)  Switzerland (1) The nationalities of many medalists are disputed, as many American competitors were recent immigrants to the United States who had not yet been granted US citizenship. The International Olympic Committee considers Norwegian-American wrestlers Charles Ericksen and Bernhoff Hansen to have competed for the United States, with each man winning a gold medal. In 2012, Norwegian historians found documentation showing that Ericksen did not receive American citizenship until March 22, 1905, and that Hansen probably never received American citizenship. The historians have therefore petitioned the IOC to have the athletes registered as Norwegians. In May 2013, it was reported that the Norwegian Olympic Committee had filed a formal application for changing the nationality of the wrestlers in the IOC's medal database.
