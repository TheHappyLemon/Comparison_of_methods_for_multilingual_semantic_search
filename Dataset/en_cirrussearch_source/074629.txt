Marek played in the Czech Extraliga for HC Oceláři Třinec and HC Sparta Praha before moving to Russia in 2006. He would play in the Russian Superleague and the Kontinental Hockey League for Metallurg Magnitogorsk, HC CSKA Moscow and Atlant Moscow Oblast.

On September 7, 2011, Marek died when a Yakovlev Yak-42 passenger aircraft, carrying nearly the entire Lokomotiv team, crashed just outside Yaroslavl, Russia. The team was traveling to Minsk to play their opening game of the season against HC Dinamo Minsk, with its coaching staff and prospects. Lokomotiv officials said "everyone from the main roster was on the plane plus four players from the youth team."
