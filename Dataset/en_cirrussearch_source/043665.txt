Edson Omar Álvarez Velázquez (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈetson ˈalβaɾes]; born 24 October 1997) is a Mexican professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder or centre-back for Premier League club West Ham United and the Mexico national team. Álvarez was born in Tlalnepantla de Baz, a municipality just north of Mexico City, to Adriana Velázquez and Evaristo Álvarez. As a child he worked for his family's business of manufacturing football kits for local teams, which he cites as his first foray into the sport. At the age of 10, Álvarez joined Pachuca, before leaving the club just two years later due to his short stature. Contemplating quitting football, to the resistance of his parents who believed he had the talent to pursue his dream of playing professionally, Álvarez decided to try out for Club América's youth team, eventually making the team after a three-month tryout. He would make it to the daily team practices by way of a three-to-four-hour round trip commute from his home in Tlalnepantla and the club's training ground in Coapa. According to Álvarez, he would spend almost 70 percent of his monthly salary toward transportation. In 2014, at age 16, Álvarez joined Club América's youth system, playing for the under-17 team. The following year, while still playing for the under-17 squad, Álvarez was promoted to América's second division team. In August 2016, first team coach Ignacio Ambríz gave Álvarez his first call-up, sitting on the bench in América's week 5 league match against Monarcas Morelia, using the jersey number 282. On 29 October, newly appointed coach Ricardo La Volpe gave 19 year-old Álvarez his Liga MX debut in the team's win over Santos Laguna; he played all 90 minutes and was voted third in a Man of the Match online poll by club fans. On 25 December, he scored his first career goal in the Apertura final against Tigres UANL. Prior to the start of the 2017–18 season, Álvarez was handed the number 4 shirt, which was vacated following the departure of Erik Pimentel. On 16 December 2018, Álvarez was given the start for the return leg of the Apertura final against Cruz Azul, playing in midfield in place of the injured Mateus Uribe, and scored twice as América won its 13th league title following a 2–0 aggregate score. On 23 February 2019, Álvarez made his 100th competitive appearance for América in the team's 3–0 victory over Lobos BUAP. On 19 July 2019, Dutch club AFC Ajax announced an agreement with Club América for the signing of Álvarez on a five-year contract, subject to a medical, for a reported fee of US$17 million. He passed his medical and was officially presented on 22 July, being handed the number 4 shirt which had been vacated following the departure of Matthijs de Ligt. The club announced an official transfer sum of €15 million. On 17 August, Álvarez made his competitive debut for Ajax as a 74th minute substitute in the team's 4–1 league win over VVV-Venlo. On 29 August, Álvarez scored his first goal in his first start against APOEL in the second-leg of the UEFA Champions League play-off round. On 17 September, Álvarez scored the second goal in the 3–0 Champions League group stage victory over Lille, becoming the first Mexican player to score on his Champions League debut. On 21 March 2021, Álvarez scored his first Eredivisie goal for Ajax in a 5–0 victory over ADO Den Haag. On 18 April, in the Dutch Cup final against Vitesse, he played the entirety of the match in a 2–1 victory. At the end of his second season, he was nominated for the league Player of the Year Award. On 27 October 2021, it was announced Álvarez had signed a contract extension with Ajax, keeping him with the club until 2025. On 30 April 2022 he was inducted into the club's Club van 100, making his 100th appearance in a 3–0 league victory over PEC Zwolle, becoming the 174th player in the history of the club to join the ranks. On 10 August 2023, English club West Ham United announced they had signed Álvarez on a five-year contract for a reported fee of £35 million. He was handed the number 19 jersey. He became the fourth Mexican player, after Guillermo Franco, Pablo Barrera, and Javier Hernández, to represent West Ham United. He made his debut on 20 August, coming on as an 81st minute substitute for James Ward-Prowse in a 3–1 victory against Chelsea. On 14 December 2023, Álvarez scored his first goal for West Ham, scoring against SC Freiburg in a 2–0 victory in the Europa League. On 2 March 2024, in a 3-1 win against Everton at Goodison Park, Álvarez scored his first Premier league goal collecting a pass from Jarrod Bowen in the 5th minute of added-time. Álvarez was called up to the under-20 team camp preparing for the 2017 CONCACAF U-20 Championship en route to the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He was included in the tournament's best XI. Álvarez was included in the World Cup under-20 squad, and scored the winning goal in Mexico's 3–2 win over Group B minnows Vanuatu. On 30 January 2017, Álvarez received his first call up to the senior national team for a friendly against Iceland. He made his senior debut on 8 February against Iceland, replacing Jesús Molina in the 60th minute. Along with Alejandro Mayorga, he was cited to be a supporting practice squad player with the Confederations Cup team. He was called up to the Gold Cup, making him the youngest player on the squad. The roster was largely composed of alternate players, as the primary squad was in Russia competing in the Confederations Cup. On 17 July, in the last game of the group stage against Curaçao, Álvarez scored his first goal for the national team in their 2–0 win, becoming the youngest Mexican player to score a goal in a Gold Cup tournament at 19 years old.

He also started in the round-of-16 defeat to Brazil. In May 2019, Álvarez was included in Gerardo Martino's provisional Gold Cup roster. In a friendly match against Venezuela, he suffered an apparent knee injury but was revealed to only be a scare. He was included in the final list for the competition. Álvarez appeared as a starter in five matches, including the final, as Mexico would go on to win the tournament.
