Hurd Peninsula lies between South Bay and False Bay on the south coast of Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. The Spanish Juan Carlos I Antarctic Base and the Bulgarian St. Kliment Ohridski Base are situated on its west coast. The peninsula was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1961 for Captain Thomas Hurd, Royal Navy, the second Hydrographer to the British Admiralty, 1808–23, who instituted a regular system of nautical surveys, and under whose authority Lieutenant Edward Bransfield's 1820 survey of the Bransfield Strait area was published in November 1822. The midpoint of the peninsula is located at 62°40′33″S 60°21′59″W﻿ / ﻿62.67583°S 60.36639°W﻿ / -62.67583; -60.36639 (Detailed Spanish mapping in 1991, and Bulgarian in 2005 and 2009).
