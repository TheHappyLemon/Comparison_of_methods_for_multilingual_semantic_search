Tupac: Live at the House of Blues is a live album and the final concert by American rapper 2Pac. The performance was recorded at the House of Blues, Sunset Strip, West Hollywood, California, on July 4, 1996 and released on both CD and DVD on September 5, 2005. Although the album is credited solely to 2Pac, the concert was in fact a joint show with Snoop Dogg and tha Dogg Pound. Throughout the first half of the show, 2Pac, backed by his hip-hop-clique, the Outlawz, performs and features the R&B duo, K-Ci & JoJo, while in the second half, Snoop Dogg goes back and forth with tha Dogg Pound and features West Coast singer, Nate Dogg. For the show's climax, 2Pac rejoins the stage and performs his then-recent hit, "2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted" alongside Snoop Dogg. Of the songs performed by 2Pac, three, at that time, were unreleased and would not see an official release until years after his death. The unreleased songs performed were "Troublesome", "Tattoo Tears" and "Never Call U Bitch Again." Tha Dogg Pound also performed an unreleased song, "Me in Your World", which would see a release later the same year on Death Row Greatest Hits. Since its release Tupac: Live at the House of Blues has sold over a million copies and is certified Platinum. The DVD and Blu-ray edition contains the entire uncut concert and includes five full-length music videos; "California Love (Remix)", "To Live & Die in L.A.", "Hit 'Em Up", "How Do You Want It" and "I Ain't Mad at Cha."
