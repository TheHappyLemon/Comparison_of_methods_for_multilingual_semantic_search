Notable spaceflight activities in 2017 included the maiden orbital flight of India's Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (also called LVM3) on 5 June and the first suborbital test of Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, inaugurating the Mahia spaceport in New Zealand. The rocket is named for its innovative Rutherford engine which feeds propellants via battery-powered electric motors instead of the usual gas generator and turbopumps. China launched its new missile-derived Kaituozhe-2 variant on 2 March. The Japanese SS-520, a suborbital sounding rocket modified for orbital flight, failed to reach orbit in January. If successful, it would have become the smallest and lightest vehicle to ever put an object in orbit. The venerable Russian Soyuz-U workhorse was retired after its 786th mission on 22 February. On 30 March, the SES-10 mission was launched with a previously flown Falcon 9 first stage, achieving a key milestone in the SpaceX reusable launch system development program; several other Falcon 9 first-stage boosters were re-used since then. After a record-breaking 13-year mission observing Saturn, its rings and moons, the Cassini space probe was deliberately destroyed by plunging into Saturn's atmosphere, on 15 September 2017. A record number of 466 satellites were attempted to be launched thanks to an increase in the number of small satellites. 289 of all satellites weighted less than 10 kg. The number of small satellites launched exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts. For the purposes of this section, the yearly tally of orbital launches by country assigns each flight to the country of origin of the rocket, not to the launch services provider or the spaceport. For example, Soyuz launches by Arianespace in Kourou are counted under Russia because Soyuz-2 is a Russian rocket. 5 10 15 20 Ariane Atlas Delta Falcon H-II Long March Minotaur PSLV R-7 UR Vega Others   Ariane 5   Atlas V   Delta II   Delta IV   Falcon 9 new   Falcon 9 reused   H-IIA   Long March 2   Long March 3   Long March 4   Long March 5   Long March 6   Long March 7   Minotaur IV   Minotaur-C   PSLV   Soyuz-U   Soyuz-FG   Soyuz-2 (Russia)   Soyuz-ST (Europe)   Proton-M   Rokot   Vega   Others 5 10 15 20 25 30 China France India Iran Japan Kazakhstan New Zealand Russia United States   Jiuquan   Taiyuan   Wenchang   Xichang   Kourou   Satish Dhawan   Semnan   Tanegashima   Uchinoura   Baikonur   Mahia   Plesetsk   Vostochny   Cape Canaveral   Kennedy   MARS   Vandenberg 10 20 30 40 50 60 Transatmospheric Low Earth Medium Earth Geosynchronous / transfer High Earth Heliocentric orbit   Transatmospheric   Low Earth   Low Earth (ISS)   Low Earth (SSO)   Low Earth (polar)   Medium Earth   Geosychronous (transfer)   High Earth   Heliocentric Notes Clockwise from top: Cassini's final mosaic portrait of Saturn. The spacecraft was intentionally deorbited into the planet's atmosphere a few days after this mosaic was taken in September, ending its nearly 20-year mission. A Falcon 9 awaits its first ever launch from the Kennedy Space Center, prior to Falcon 9 Flight 30 in February. It was the first launch to occur from Kennedy since STS-135 in July 2011. The first orbital flight of the LVM3, during LVM3 D1 in June. The launch vehicle will eventually carry the Gaganyaan crewed spacecraft in the 2020s as part of the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. Astronaut Peggy Whitson aboard the International Space Station in August, during Expedition 52. It was during this expedition that she broke the records for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, and the longest cumulative days spent in space by an American.
