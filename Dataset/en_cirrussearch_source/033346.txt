He played at fourth board (+6 –3 =3), and won team gold medal. In September 1939, when World War II broke out, he along with all members of the German team (Eliskases, Michel, Engels, Becker, Reinhardt) and many other participants of this Olympiad decided to stay permanently in Argentina. In 1944, Alberto Becker took 3rd, behind José María Cristiá and Pablo Michel, in Buenos Aires (La Regence). Becker was awarded the International Master (IM) title in 1953. When Vera Menchik entered the Carlsbad 1929 chess tournament, at a time it was unusual for a woman to play against masters, Becker is said to have joked that any player she defeated would join the "Vera Menchik Club". Becker went on to become the first member of the "club". This story may be apocryphal, however, given that the earliest known source for it is a book printed in 1980, 51 years after when it is said to have occurred. In addition to Becker, the "club" eventually included Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander, Abraham Baratz, Eero Böök, Edgard Colle, Max Euwe, Harry Golombek, Mir Sultan Khan, Frederic Lazard, Jacques Mieses, Stuart Milner-Barry, Karel Opočenský, Brian Reilly, Samuel Reshevsky, Friedrich Sämisch, Lajos Steiner, George Alan Thomas, William Winter, and Frederick Yates.
