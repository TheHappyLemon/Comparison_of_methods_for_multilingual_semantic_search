Kronwall was originally drafted 285th overall by the Maple Leafs in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. Kronwall represented Sweden at the 2002 World Junior Championship, playing seven games for Sweden. Kronwall was then drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the ninth round, 285th overall, of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, spending the majority of his first four seasons in North American with the Leafs' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. Toronto later placed him on waivers midway through the 2008–09 season, where he was claimed by the Washington Capitals. He signed later with the Calgary Flames via free agency in 2009. Kronwall scored his first career NHL goal on October 6, 2009, in a 4–3 win against goaltender Jaroslav Halák of the Montreal Canadiens, but spent the majority of the season with the AHL's Abbotsford Heat.

With the blessing of the Flames, Kronwall signed a one-year contract with his former team, Djurgårdens IF, on October 11, 2010. After one season with Djurgården, Kronwall moved to Russian side Severstal Cherepovets of the KHL.
