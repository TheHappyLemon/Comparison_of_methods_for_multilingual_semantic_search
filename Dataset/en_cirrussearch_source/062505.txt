Golem is a 1979 Polish science fiction film directed and co-written by Piotr Szulkin. Inspired by the titular being in Jewish folklore, as well as the 1915 novel The Golem by Austrian author Gustav Meyrink, the film takes place in a 21st-century dystopia and reimagines the golem as a genetic clone.
