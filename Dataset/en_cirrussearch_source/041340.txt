Miguel Ángel Trauco Saavedra (born 25 August 1992) is a Peruvian professional footballer who plays as a left-back and left midfielder for Campeonato Brasileiro Série A club Criciúma and the Peru national team. Trauco's polished technique, precise passing, and great dribbling skills have made him an asset in the attacking force of his team as well as a solid defender. With his great capabilities to unfold himself into the attacking and defending areas of the field, Trauco is a sharp contributor in any situation. Trauco was born in Tarapoto; he is the son of Miguel Trauco Alvarado and Bessy Saavedra Armas.[citation needed] Trauco started his career in the Copa Perú division with Unión Comercio in 2010. He made six appearances in the National Stage that season including the two matches against Alianza Unicachi in the Final. His side won on away goals and were promoted to the First Division the following season. In 2016, he signed for Universitario de Deportes.[citation needed] In October 2016 Brazilian and Peruvian press reported rumors about Flamengo's possible interest for signing Trauco. Shortly after, on 13 December 2016, Trauco gave an interview to Peruvian newspaper Libero confirming his transfer to Flamengo for the 2017 season. However, the Brazilian club did not confirm any signing, saying they are still negotiating with Trauco. Trauco was elected 2016 Peruvian Primera División best player with 39 appearances, one goal and 11 assists. After many rumors in the press Flamengo announced officially Traucos's signing, on 14 December 2016. He signed a three-year contract with the Brazilian club. He debuted for his new club on 28 January 2017 scoring a goal and two assists against Boavista, in the opening match of the 2017 Campeonato Carioca.[citation needed] After Flamengo signed Filipe Luís Trauco lost space and became the team's third left back. As he only had five more months under his contract the Brazilian club decided to accept a low offer from Saint-Étienne to avoid losing Trauco on a free transfer. On 31 July 2019, Flamengo announced that they would accept a €600,000 offer for Trauco from Ligue 1 club Saint-Étienne. On 2 September 2022, Trauco signed with Major League Soccer side San Jose Earthquakes on a one-and-a-half year deal. Trauco debuted for the Peru national team on 6 August 2014 as a substitute in a 3–0 win against Panama. He also appeared as a substitute in a match against Iran on 4 September 2014.[citation needed] He returned to the national team in 2016 and has been a fixture at left-back ever since. He started in all thirteen of his appearances in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches between 2016 and 2017, including Peru's intercontinental playoff victory against New Zealand which qualified Peru for their first FIFA World Cup since 1982.[citation needed] On 17 May 2016, Trauco was named to the Peru national team for the Copa América Centenario in the United States. He started all four matches for Peru as they won their group, but missed his penalty in a shootout loss to Colombia in the quarter-finals. On 14 May 2018, Trauco was named to the Peru national team for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He started all three matches for the squad in the group stage.[citation needed] On 30 May 2019, Trauco was named to the Peru national team for the 2019 Copa América in Brazil by manager Ricardo Gareca. He started all six matches for Peru throughout the tournament, including the final on 7 July, which ended in a 3–1 defeat to hosts Brazil.
