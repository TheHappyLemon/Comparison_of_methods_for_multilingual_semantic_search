Moers (German pronunciation: [ˈmœʁs] ; older form: Mörs; Dutch: Murse, Murs or Meurs) is a German city on the western bank of the Rhine, close to Duisburg. Moers belongs to the district of Wesel. Known earliest from 1186, the county of Moers was an independent principality within the Holy Roman Empire. During the Eighty Years' War it was alternately captured by Spanish and Dutch troops, as it bordered the Upper Quarter of Guelders. During the war it finally fell to Maurice of Orange. As it was separated from the Dutch Republic by Spanish Upper Guelders it did not become an integral part of the Republic, though Dutch troops were stationed there. After the death of William III of Orange in 1702, Moers was inherited by the king of Prussia. All Dutch troops and civil servants were expelled. In 1795 it was annexed by France. At the Congress of Vienna, in 1815 it was returned to Prussia and in 1871 it became part of the German Empire. A target of the Oil Campaign of World War II, the Steinkohlenbergwerke (English: coal mine) Rheinpreussen synthetic oil plant in Moers, was partially dismantled post-war. 1815–1820: Wilhelm Urbach 1822–1830: von Nievenheim 1830–1850: Friedrich Adolf Vinmann 1850–1859: Karl von Strampff 1860–1864: Gottlieb Meumann 1864–1897: Gustav Kautz 1898–1910: August Craemer 1910–1915: Richard Glum 1917–1937: Fritz Eckert 1937–1941: Fritz Grüttgen 1943–1945: Peter Linden 1945–1946: Otto Maiweg 1946: Karl Peschken 1946–1952: Wilhelm Müller 1952–1977: Albin Neuse (SPD) 1977–1999: Wilhelm Brunswick (SPD) 1999–2004: Rafael Hofmann (CDU) 2004–2014: Norbert Ballhaus (SPD) 2014–0000: Christoph Fleischhauer (CDU) In 1985, the Moers Sports Club (volleyball) was formed, winning the 1989 Bundesliga championship.
