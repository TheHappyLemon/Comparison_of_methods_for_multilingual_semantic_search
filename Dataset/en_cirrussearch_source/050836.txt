The total length of the Chiers is approximately 140 kilometres (87 mi), of which 127 km (79 mi) in France. The source of the Chiers is near Differdange, in Luxembourg. The Chiers flows roughly in western direction, and crosses the border with Belgium and flows through Athus (province of Luxembourg). It then crosses the border with France, flows through Longwy and Longuyon (Meurthe-et-Moselle) and forms the border with Belgium for a few kilometres near Torgny (in the municipality of Rouvroy). It continues through France, along Montmédy (Meuse) and Carignan (Ardennes). The Chiers flows into the Meuse at Bazeilles, near Sedan.
