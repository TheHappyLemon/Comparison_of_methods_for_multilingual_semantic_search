Hluk (German: Hulken) is a town in Uherské Hradiště District in the Zlín Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 4,300 inhabitants. The name of Hluk is very likely derived from Latin word hlucium (English: noise, Czech: hluk). It probably got its name from the noisy flowing water of the Okluky stream. Hluk is located about 10 kilometres (6 mi) southeast of Uherské Hradiště and 28 km (17 mi) south of Zlín. It lies in the Vizovice Highlands. The highest point is at 366 m (1,201 ft) above sea level. The Okluky stream flows through the town. In the municipal territory are the nature reserve Kobylí hlava and the nature monuments Okluky and Pod Husí horou. The first written mention of Hluk is from 1294. However, the first mention of the wider region called Lucké pole Province is from the 11th century.
