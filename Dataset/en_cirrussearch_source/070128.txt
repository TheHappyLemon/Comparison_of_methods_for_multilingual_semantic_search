His younger brother, Llŷr Ifans, is also an actor. He grew up in Ruthin, where he received his primary education at Ysgol Pentrecelyn and was raised speaking Welsh as his first language. He attended Ysgol Maes Garmon, a Welsh medium secondary school in Mold, where he took his O levels and A levels. He attended acting classes at Theatr Clwyd. After leaving school, he presented Welsh-language television programmes on S4C. He studied acting at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he graduated in 1997.

Ifans also appeared as Grigori Rasputin in the spy film The King's Man, which was released in December 2021. Ifans was briefly lead vocalist of the rock band Super Furry Animals before they released any records.
