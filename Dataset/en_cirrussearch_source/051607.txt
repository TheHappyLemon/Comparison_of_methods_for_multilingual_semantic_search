On 3 September 2014, Tufan scored his first goal, a long range shot against Denmark in a friendly game at 90th minute. Turkey won the game 2–1. In a post-match interview about the game he replied " I had the ball in front of me and right when I was about to kick it, I heard Arda Turan backing me to shoot. I initially had the scare of hitting my shot off-range, on such an important moment; but I kept my composure and hit the ball right after. I want to thank Fatih Terim for giving me this chance, I think I've done the best I could today."
