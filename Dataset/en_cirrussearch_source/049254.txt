Tomáš Vaclík (Czech pronunciation: [ˈtomaːʃ ˈvatsliːk]; born 29 March 1989) is a Czech professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Spanish Segunda División club Albacete and the Czech Republic national team. Vaclík participated in the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship and was named in the team of the tournament. He made his senior debut for the Czech Republic in 2012 and was part of the side's squad at UEFA Euro 2016 and UEFA Euro 2020. Vaclík started out with FC Vítkovice in the Czech 2. Liga where he played for three seasons before transferring to Viktoria Žižkov. Žižkov won promotion to the Czech First League in Vaclík's first season with the club. In July 2011, Vaclík signed a three-year contract with De Graafschap but it was later announced that he had failed a medical in the Netherlands and would be returning to Prague. Vaclík played for Žižkov during the first half of the 2011–12 Czech First League. In January 2012, with Žižkov bottom of the league with seven points from 16 matches, Vaclík transferred to Sparta Prague for a reported fee of 8.25 million CZK, signing a contract to keep him at the club until the summer of 2016. On 22 May 2014 it was announced that Vaclík had signed for FC Basel of the Swiss Super League on a four-year contract with an option for another year. He joined the team for their 2014–15 season under head coach Paulo Sousa. After playing in four test games Vaclik played his domestic league debut for the club in the away game in the Stadion Brügglifeld on 19 July 2014 as Basel won 2–1 against Aarau. Basel entered the Champions League in the group stage. They reached the knockout phase on 9 December 2014, as they managed a 1–1 draw at Anfield against Liverpool. But they were knocked out of the competition by Porto in the round of 16. At the end of the 2014–15 season, Basel won the championship for the sixth time in a row. In the 2014–15 Swiss Cup Basel reached the final. However for the third time in a row they finished as runners-up. Basel played a total of 65 matches (36 Swiss League fixtures, 6 Swiss Cup, 8 Champions League and 15 test matches). Under manager Paulo Sousa Vaclík totaled 51 appearances, 33 in the League, 8 in the Champions League as well 10 in test games. At the end of the 2015–16 Super League season, under new head coach Urs Fischer, Vaclík won the championship for the second time. Vaclík then extended his contract with the club, this was then dated up until the end of June 2021. At the end of Basel's 2016–17 season, Vaclík won the championship with the club for the third time. For the club this was the eighth title in a row and their 20th championship title in total. They also won the 2016–17 Swiss Cup, defeating Sion 3–0 in the final, which meant they had won the double. Basel's new head coach for their 2017–18 season was Raphaël Wicky. This season didn't work out that well for the team. After losing against Young Boys in the first match of the season, Basel were always behind in the league table. They ended the championship as runners-up. In the 2017–18 Swiss Cup Basel reached the semi-final, but here they suffered a defeat against the Young Boys as well. On 4 July 2018 Basel announced that Vaclic had signed for Sevilla FC. In his four seasons as their first goalkeeper, Vaclic played a total of 195 games for Basel. 132 of these games were in the Swiss Super League, four in the Swiss Cup, 33 in the UEFA competitions (Champions League and Europa League) and 26 were friendly games. He had won the championship three times and the Swiss Cup once. On 9 July 2018, Vaclík signed with Sevilla FC in Spain's La Liga. After three years, Vaclík confirmed on his Facebook page that he would leave Sevilla after the end of the season. On 13 July 2021, Vaclík signed a two-year contract with Olympiacos F.C. of the Super League Greece. He was signed to replace José Sá, who moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 31 January 2023, Vaclík signed a contract with EFL Championship side Huddersfield Town until the end of the 2022–23 season. On 26 August 2023, Vaclík signed a contract with Major League Soccer side New England Revolution through the 2024 season, with a club option for 2025, pending receipt of his P-1 visa. On 13 February 2024, Vaclík joined Albacete in Spain until the end of the 2023–24 season. Vaclík represented Czech Republic at youth level between 2005 and 2011, progressing from the under-16 team up to the under-21 team. Vaclík was involved in the national team for the first time in 2011, selected as a third goalkeeper for the squad's matches against Spain and Luxembourg, although he did not play.
