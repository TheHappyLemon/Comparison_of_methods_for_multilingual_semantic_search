"Off the Grid" is a song by American rapper Kanye West from his tenth studio album Donda (2021). The song features vocals from American rappers Playboi Carti and Fivio Foreign. It was released to US urban contemporary radio stations as the album's fourth single on November 30, 2021 (third promoted to radio formats). On July 18, 2020, West announced Donda on his Twitter and posted a track listing that had "Off the Grid" on it. In December, it was revealed that West was recording and executive producing for Playboi Carti's album Whole Lotta Red, which released on December 25. Playboi Carti recorded his verse for "Off the Grid" during these sessions. A snippet of Playboi Carti's part leaked after West played the song on his speakers during his stay at a hotel in Belgium in December. The collaboration with Fivio Foreign came together after West asked Fivio Foreign to come to Mercedes Benz Stadium on the night before the August 5 listening party. Talking about the collaboration, Fivio Foreign recalled: He gave me my space, but every eight couple bars, "I'm like yo look, I got some shit" and he's like, "Yo, keep going". That’s why it is so long, he kept telling me to keep going, keep going like three times. Like how much more, "Just keep going". [...] I was playing a couple of songs, and he was like "Who produced this?", and I'm like my man AyoAA – Ozzy, and he's like "Get him on a plane, get him out here". The "Off the Grid" shit was already done, he sent me that beat before I even met him. It wasn't drill. He got my producer Ozzy to add the drill to the song on my part. The song was first officially previewed at the August 5 listening party at Mercedes Benz Stadium. It was previewed again in Soldier Field on August 26, with an added verse from West at the end.[citation needed] The track was named the best song of 2021 by Complex. Credits adapted from Tidal.
