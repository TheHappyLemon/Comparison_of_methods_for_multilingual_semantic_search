Valga (German: Walk) is a town in southern Estonia and the capital of Valga County and Valga Parish. Until their separation in 1920, Valga and the town of Valka in northern Latvia were one town. They are now twin-towns. The area of Valga is 16.5 square kilometres (6.4 square miles) and that of Valka is 14.2 km2 (5.5 sq mi). Their populations are respectively 12,261 and 6,164. On 21 December 2007 all border-crossing points were removed and roads and fences opened between the two countries with both countries joining the Schengen Agreement. The distance to Tartu is 89 km (55 mi), Pärnu 144 km (89 mi), Tallinn 245 km (152 mi), Riga 175 km (109 mi) and Pskov 170 km (106 mi). Valga is situated at the junction of roads and railways. The Valga-Võru-Koidula railway runs to the town. Trains stopped running in 2001. At the time, the railway only ran to Piusa, as the Koidula border station was yet to be built. Along the line, there was a morning and evening trip in each direction as of 1995, and a trip in the midday that only went to Võru. An international train to St. Petersburg ran in the night. Trains were extended in 1997 to Veski, when the train line Tartu-PiirTP was cut back from the Russian border to Orava. Freight trains on the Valga-Võru-Koidula line have been cut back significantly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Tartu-Valga railway line also serves this station.
