The 2013–14 Biathlon World Cup was a multi-race tournament over a season of biathlon, organised by the International Biathlon Union. The season started on 24 November 2013 in Östersund, Sweden, and ended on 23 March 2014 in Holmenkollen, Norway. Kaisa Mäkäräinen was the winner at the conclusion of the season with Tora Berger 2nd.
