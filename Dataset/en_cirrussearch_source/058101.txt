Alexander Nübel (born 30 September 1996) is a German professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart, on loan from Bayern Munich. Nübel grew up in Salzkotten-Tudorf in East Westphalia, and began playing football at TSV Tudorf. In 2005 he moved to the youth department of SC Paderborn, where he was initially active as an outfield player until under-14 level. Initially with Paderborn, he moved up to the professional squad for the 2014–15 season, but remained inactive throughout the season. Nübel then moved to Schalke 04, where he was utilised in the second team competing in the Regionalliga West. On 14 May 2016, he made his Bundesliga debut against TSG Hoffenheim when he replaced Ralf Fährmann after 90 minutes. Nübel started the season as Schalke's backup goalkeeper to Fährmann. On 24 October 2018, he made his Champions League debut for Schalke in a 0–0 away draw against Galatasaray. After the winter break, Schalke's head coach Domenico Tedesco, dropped Fährmann as the club's first-choice goalkeeper and promoted Nübel. On 2 February 2019, Nübel was sent off with a straight red card in a match against Borussia Mönchengladbach and was suspended for the club's next two Bundesliga matches. He started in every match for Schalke after he was selected as the first-choice goalkeeper, with the exception of the two matches he was suspended for. On 6 August 2019, Nübel was selected by Schalke's head coach David Wagner as the club's new captain. He entered the season with only one year left on his contract with Schalke. On 22 December 2019, Schalke revealed that Nübel had informed the club that he would not renew his contract. On 4 January 2020, Nübel agreed to join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the end of the season. He then handed the captaincy over to Omar Mascarell. Nübel joined Bayern Munich on 30 June 2020.
