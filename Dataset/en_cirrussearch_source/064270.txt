Jeremie Agyekum Frimpong (born 10 December 2000) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a right wing-back for Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen and the Netherlands national team. Frimpong joined Manchester City at the age of nine and progressed through the club's youth ranks, with regular appearances in Premier League 2 and the UEFA Youth League. On 2 September 2019, Frimpong signed a four-year deal with Celtic. Later that month, he made his professional debut against Partick Thistle in the Scottish League Cup quarter-finals. He made an immediate impact, winning the man of the match award on his debut, and going to become a regular in the first team. His speed and skill was highlighted by the media, and made him popular with Celtic fans. Frimpong quickly became a fan favorite with his electrifying pace, tenacity, and attacking prowess from the right-back position. On 27 October, Frimpong scored in a 4–0 win against Aberdeen, his first professional goal. He won his first career honour on 8 December 2019, when Celtic defeated Rangers 1–0 in the Scottish League Cup Final. He was described by Celtic manager Neil Lennon as "outstanding" and "arguably our best [outfield] player in the first half", although he was sent off early in the second half for a foul on Alfredo Morelos in the penalty box. In June 2020, Frimpong was voted Celtic's Young Player of the Year for season 2019–20 by the club's supporters. On 27 January 2021, Frimpong signed for German side Bayer Leverkusen for an undisclosed fee, on a four and a half year deal. On 3 October 2023, he extended his contract until 2028. Born in the Netherlands, Frimpong is of Ghanaian descent. His family moved to England when he was seven years old. As such, he is eligible to play for the Netherlands, Ghana, and England. Frimpong has represented the Netherlands at under-19 youth international level, and made his international debut against Armenia U19 in November 2018. In November 2019, he made his under-20 debut. In November 2022, Frimpong was included in the final selection of the Netherlands senior national team for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Even though, according to an article on the NOS website, he does not speak a lot of Dutch, he understands match talks and football language. He did not appear in the tournament, as the Netherlands were knocked out by Argentina in the quarter-finals. He made his first appearance for the Netherlands on 13 October 2023, making a substitute appearance in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying match against France. Frimpong is a devout Christian.
