The 2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League is the third season of the UEFA Europa Conference League, Europe's tertiary club football tournament organised by UEFA. The final will be played at the Agia Sophia Stadium in Athens, Greece. The winners of the tournament will automatically qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League league stage, unless they qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League through their league performance. This edition will be the final season with the current format of 32 teams participating in the group stage, after UEFA announced that a brand-new format would be introduced for the following edition. Due to the change, no clubs can be transferred from the Europa League group stage to the UEFA Europa Conference League under the Swiss format, and this edition's winners onwards will no longer be able to defend their title. This will also be the final season under its current name as it is renamed to the UEFA Conference League from the 2024–25 season onwards. According to UEFA, the new denomination of the competition will enable further development as a stand-alone competition in their research amongst fans and commercial partners. As the title holders, West Ham United qualified for the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League. They are unable to defend their title after advancing to the Europa League knockout phase. A total of 178 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations (excluding Russia) are participating in the 2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League. The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: Associations 1–5 each had one team qualify. Associations 6–16 (except Russia) and 51–55 each had two teams qualify. Associations 17–50 (except Liechtenstein) each had three teams qualify. Liechtenstein had only one team that qualified as they organized only a domestic cup and no domestic league. Moreover, 18 teams eliminated from the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League and 25 teams eliminated from the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League were transferred to the Europa Conference League. For the 2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2022 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2017–18 to 2021–22. Apart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Europa Conference League, as noted below: (UCL) – Additional teams transferred from the UEFA Champions League (UEL) – Additional teams transferred from the UEFA Europa League The following is the access list for this season. Due to the suspension of Russia for the 2023–24 European season, the following changes to the access list were made: The cup winners of association 16 (Czech Republic) entered the Europa League third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round. The cup winners of associations 17 to 19 (Norway, Denmark and Croatia) entered the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round. The cup winners of associations 30 to 39 (Slovakia, Slovenia, Belarus, Moldova, Lithuania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Finland, Luxembourg, Latvia and Kosovo) entered the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round. Combining with the Champions League title holder (Manchester City) qualifying for the Champions League group stage via their domestic league, the following changes to the access list were made: Two of the Champions League first qualifying round losers received byes and entered the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round. The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round: The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round: CW: Domestic cup winners 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, etc.: League position of the previous season LC: League cup winners RW: Regular season winners PW: End-of-season Europa Conference League play-offs winners UCL: Transferred from the Champions League Q1: Losers from the first qualifying round PR: Losers from the preliminary round (F: final; SF: semi-finals) UEL: Transferred from the Europa League GS: Third-placed teams from the group stage PO: Losers from the play-off round CH/MP Q3: Losers from the third qualifying round (Champions/Main Path) The second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round were divided into Champions Path (CH) and Main Path (MP). CC: 2023 UEFA club coefficients. One team not playing in a national top division took part in the competition: Vaduz (2nd tier). Notes Champions League (UCL Q1): Two of the Champions League first qualifying round losers were drawn to receive byes to the third qualifying round (Champions Path), as two fewer losers were transferred to the second qualifying round (Champions Path), due to Champions League group stage berths vacated following the UCL title holders qualifying via league position and the suspension of Russia from the 2023–24 European season. Belarus (BLR): The winners (Shakhtyor Soligorsk) and runners-up (Energetik-BGU Minsk) of the 2022 Belarusian Premier League were both found guilty of match-fixing by the Football Federation of Belarus and were denied UEFA licenses. Fifth-placed Isloch Minsk Raion were also denied a UEFA license due to their involvement in another match-fixing scandal. The sixth- and seventh-placed teams, Minsk and Gomel did not apply for UEFA licences. As eighth-placed Torpedo-BelAZ Zhodino had already qualified for the second qualifying round as cup winners, the Europa Conference League berth reserved for the usual third-placed team was passed down to the highest-placed team who were granted a UEFA license, Neman Grodno, who finished ninth. Italy (ITA): Due to a violation of UEFA's financial regulations, the seventh-placed Juventus were excluded from UEFA men’s club competitions. Subsequently, Fiorentina, the eighth-placed team, took its place in the Europa Conference League. Kosovo (KOS): Prishtina would have qualified for the Europa Conference League second qualifying round as the winners of the 2022–23 Kosovar Cup, but failed to obtain a UEFA license. As a result, the berth reserved for the second qualifying round was given to the runner-up of the 2022–23 Football Superleague of Kosovo, Drita, who originally entered the first qualifying round, and the berth reserved for the first qualifying round was given to the fourth-placed team, Dukagjini. Liechtenstein (LIE): The seven teams affiliated with the Liechtenstein Football Association (LFV) all played in the Swiss football league system. The only competition organised by the LFV was the Liechtenstein Football Cup – the winners of which qualified for the UEFA Europa Conference League. Russia (RUS): On 28 February 2022, Russian football clubs and national teams were suspended from FIFA and UEFA competitions due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The tables reflected Russia's ongoing suspension from UEFA competitions. San Marino (SMR): Cup winners Virtus were found guilty of match-fixing and denied a UEFA license. The third-placed team of the league, La Fiorita, were selected as their replacement by the San Marino Football Federation. Ukraine (UKR): The 2022–23 Ukrainian Cup was abandoned due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. The berths reserved for the third and fourth-placed teams in the league were transferred to the fourth and fifth-placed teams in the league respectively.

Overall goal difference used as a tiebreaker. In the knockout phase, teams play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows: In the draw for the knockout round play-offs, the eight group runners-up were seeded, and the eight Europa League group third-placed teams were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. In the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight winners of the knockout round play-offs were unseeded. Again, the seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. In the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there are no seedings, and teams from the same association could be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals are held together before the quarter-finals are played, the identity of the quarter-final winners will not be known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw will also be held to determine which semi-final winner will be designated as the "home" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it is played at a neutral venue). The draw for the knockout round play-offs was held on 18 December 2023, 14:00 CET. The first legs were played on 15 February, and the second legs were played on 21 and 22 February 2024.
