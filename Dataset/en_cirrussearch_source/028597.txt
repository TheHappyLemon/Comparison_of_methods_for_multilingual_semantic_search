Olonkinbyen[needs IPA] (literally The Olonkin Town) is the only settlement on the Norwegian island of Jan Mayen (aside from isolated cottage huts such as Puppebu). It was named after Russian-Norwegian explorer Gennady Olonkin.

Supplies are delivered eight times a year by aircraft. Fuel and heavy goods are transported by boat during the summer. The settlement generates its own electrical power via three generators.
