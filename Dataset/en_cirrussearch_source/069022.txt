Benzal chloride is an organic compound with the formula C6H5CHCl2. This colourless liquid is a lachrymator and is used as a building block in organic synthesis. Benzal chloride is produced by the free radical chlorination of toluene, being preceded in the process by benzyl chloride (C6H5CH2Cl) and followed by benzotrichloride (C6H5CCl3): C6H5CH3 + Cl2 → C6H5CH2Cl + HCl C6H5CH2Cl + Cl2 → C6H5CHCl2 + HCl C6H5CHCl2 + Cl2 → C6H5CCl3 + HCl Benzylic halides are typically strong alkylating agents, and for this reason benzal chloride is treated as a hazardous compound. Treatment of benzal chloride with sodium gives stilbene. Most benzal chloride main industrial use is as a precursor to benzaldehyde. This conversion involves hydrolysis in the presence of base: C6H5CHCl2 + H2O → C6H5CHO + 2 HCl "BENZAL CHLORIDE". International Programme on Chemical Safety. Retrieved 2007-10-30.
