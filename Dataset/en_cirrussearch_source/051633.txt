On 29 January 2020, it was announced that Özyakup joined Eredivisie side Feyenoord on loan until the end of the 2019-20 season, taking the shirt number 18. Özyakup wrote on Instagram that he was upset in his recent days with Beşiktaş due to misleading and malevolent news made about him and he was "...just [taking a break] for a long-standing relationship [with Beşiktaş]...". In his first match with Feyenoord, he scored the opener in the 93rd second in a 3-0 home win against FC Emmen. However, this would be his only goal for Feyenoord as he managed to play only four matches, two in the league, before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and the season was suspended. On 27 July 2020, Feyenoord manager Dick Advocaat announced that Özyakup returned to Beşiktaş. On 1 September 2022, Özyakup signed two-year deal with Eredivisie club Fortuna Sittard.

Coincidentally, Özyakup scored his first international goal for Turkey right against the Netherlands on 6 September 2015 in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying. "Someone who saw Oğuzhan [Özyakup] yesterday for the first time might say: "What kind of a player is that? Did he come from outer space?". They might say: "He dribbles like [Zinedine] Zidane." He is an intelligent player." Rıdvan Dilmen, 17 August 2015, Sabah. Özyakup is an energetic attacking-minded central midfielder. Under Slaven Bilić, he was used as an attacking midfielder but Şenol Güneş moved him back to central midfield, which Özyakup himself prefers. Being able to play simple and quickly, Özyakup can lead the team play. He is "skillful" at finishing and possesses a high level of anticipation that allows him to be at the right place on the pitch, according to former Beşiktaş and Turkish international forward Feyyaz Uçar. In 2015, former Croatian international and Beşiktaş manager Slaven Bilić praised dribbling and passing abilities of Özyakup, likening him to a "snake" due to his slalom-alike opponent-passing dribbling style. Özyakup was called a "magician" by former Turkish international and current pundit Rıdvan Dilmen in 2015. Dilmen also said that Özyakup was an "intelligent" player, praised his "Zinedine Zidane-like" dribbling attributes and claimed that he was talented enough to play for Barcelona. In 2016, Turkey national team captain Arda Turan stated he believes Özyakup will become the leader once he (Turan) quits the national team, describing Özyakup as an "outstanding player", being "very intelligent" and "a big talent". Özyakup is an admirer of the playmaking styles of Zinedine Zidane and the Argentine Juan Román Riquelme. After falling out of favor with the then coach Şenol Güneş during the 2018/2019 season, TV pundit Ali Ece claimed on a YouTube show that Özyakup was receiving mental health assistance from sports psychologists. While the public and the rest of the sports media generally agreed that Ece crossed a line in disclosing private information, Özyakup nonetheless denied the claims and sued him for slander.
