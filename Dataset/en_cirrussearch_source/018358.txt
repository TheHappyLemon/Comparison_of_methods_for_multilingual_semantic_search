The 2012–13 Latvian Football Cup is the eightieth season of the Latvian annual football knock-out competition. The winners, FK Ventspils, qualify for the first qualifying round of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League. The matches of this round took place between 3 and 13 June 2012. Because this season the Latvian Cup had only eight teams in its first round, playing a second one was not necessary, so the first round winners received an automatic bye for the third round, where they will meet First League clubs. Entering this round were the 4 teams from the previous round and 8 teams who enter the competition in this round. The matches of this round took place between 30 June and 7 July 2012. Entering this round were the 6 teams from the previous round and the 10 teams from the Latvian Higher League who enter the competition in this round. These matches took place on 21 and 22 July 2012. 16 March 2013 15:00 EET Daugavas stadions, Daugavpils Attendance: 100 Referee: Vadims Direktorenko 16 March 2013 16:00 EET Daugava Stadium, Liepāja Attendance: 400 Referee: Andris Treimanis 17 March 2013 12:30 EET Slokas Stadium, Jūrmala Attendance: 200 Referee: Aleksandrs Golubevs 16 March 2013 15:30 EET Skonto halle, Riga Attendance: 120 Referee: Mareks Ķere 4 May 2013 14:00 EET Ventspils Olimpiskais Stadions, Ventspils Attendance: 300 Referee: Aleksandrs Anufrijevs 4 May 2013 15:00 EET Daugava Stadium, Riga Attendance: 250 Referee: Ivars Caune 18 May 2013 17:00 EEST Skonto Stadium, Riga Attendance: 1100 Referee: Andris Treimanis 2013/14 Access list[permanent dead link] Bert Kassies' Site LFF.lv
