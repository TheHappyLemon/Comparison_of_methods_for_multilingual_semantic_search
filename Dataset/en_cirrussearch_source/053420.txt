Dabbur was born in Nazareth, Israel, to an Arab-Muslim family of Palestinian descent. His brother Anas Dabbur is also a footballer, who currently plays as a midfielder for Maccabi Ahi Nazareth. Dabbur's father Kasam died in a car accident in 2009. Dabbur started his career in the Israeli Maccabi Nazareth and Maccabi Tel Aviv youth academies. He made his senior debut with Israeli Premier League club Maccabi Tel Aviv in 2011. In the 2011–12 season, he participated in 26 league matches for Maccabi, scoring eight goals. In the 2012–13 Israeli Premier League season, he was part of Maccabi Tel Aviv's squad that has become champions after a ten-year drought spell, providing the team with 10 goals in 26 matches. His efforts were instrumental in securing the Israeli League Championship, marking the team’s first title in a decade.  Dabbur started the season providing two important goals on 27 August 2011 against Maccabi Haifa, goals that were described as "extremely crucial" for the rest of the season in the tight race for achieving the title.[citation needed] Dabbur ended the season after being injured for a one-month period during the warm up to the derby match against Hapoel Tel Aviv on 6 April 2013. On 4 February 2014, Dabbur confirmed his transfer to the Swiss Super League after its club Grasshoppers paid a transfer fee of $425,000 to his previous Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv. On 16 February 2014, he had his first appearance at Zurich, when he came on from the bench in the second half scoring two goals and assisting once in a 5–1 win against St. Gallen. Dabbur finished his debut season at Grasshoppers with nine goals and four assists in 15 league matches. The 2014–15 season was comparatively less successful with Dabbur scoring 13 times in the league and five in the cup. He also provided 8 assists in the league, reaffirming his position as one of Grasshoppers' best and most valuable players. During the summer of 2015, several clubs were rumoured to be interested in Dabbur, including German club Werder Bremen and Italian club Palermo. However, the only two clubs to bid for him were the aforementioned Palermo and his previous Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv. Both bids were rejected and Dabbur signed a new, greatly improved contract with Swiss club Grasshoppers. Dabbur enjoyed a good start to the 2015–16 Swiss Super League season, scoring eight and assisting eight goals in his club's first eight games including a goal and a hat-trick of assists in Grasshoppers' opening game against Thun. In May 2016, Dabbur signed with Austrian Bundesliga club Red Bull Salzburg for five years. During the 2017–18 season, Salzburg finished top of their Europa League group, for a record fourth time, before beating Real Sociedad and Borussia Dortmund thus making their first ever appearance in the UEFA Europa League semi-final. On 3 May 2018, he played in the Europa League semi-finals as Olympique de Marseille played out a 2–1 away loss but a 3–2 aggregate win to secure a place in the 2018 UEFA Europa League Final. In February 2017, Dabbur was loaned mid-season back to his previous Swiss club of Grasshoppers, until the end of the season. On 17 January 2019, Dabbur agreed terms to join Spanish La Liga club Sevilla. He agreed to a four-year contract, but stayed with his previous Austrian Bundesliga club Red Bull Salzburg until the end of the campaign. Dabbur made his debut with Sevilla during the 2019–20 La Liga matchweek 16, coming on as a substitute for Óliver Torres in the 78th minute, in a 1–1 tie at Osasuna. On 7 January 2020, it was disclosed that Dabbur had signed a contract until 2024 with German Bundesliga club TSG Hoffenheim for a reported fee of 12 million euros. On 12 July 2023, Emirati club Shabab Al-Ahli announced the signing of Dabbur, for a reported fee of €1.5 million.
