In 2014, the maiden flight of the Angara A5, Antares 120 and Antares 130 took place. A total of 92 orbital launches were attempted in 2014, of which 88 were successful, two were partially successful and two were failures. The year also saw seven EVAs by ISS astronauts. The majority of the year's orbital launches were conducted by Russia, the United States and China, with 34, 23 and 16 launches respectively. An Ariane 5 ES launched the Georges Lemaître Automated Transfer Vehicle, the last one of the series, which also marked 60 successfully completed Ariane 5 launches in a row. On 22 August 2014, Arianespace launched the first two Full Operational Capability Galileo satellites for the European satellite navigation system. A number of significant events in planetary exploration occurred in 2014, including the entry of the Rosetta spacecraft into orbit around the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko in August 2014 and the deployment of the Philae lander to its surface in November, which marked the first orbit of and landing on a comet, respectively, and featured prominently in social media. Another notable occurrence was the entry of India's Mars Orbiter Mission into Martian orbit in September, making India the first Asian nation to reach Mars. On 5 December 2014, a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy launched the first Orion spacecraft test mission for NASA, Exploration Flight Test 1. For the purposes of this section, the yearly tally of orbital launches by country assigns each flight to the country of origin of the rocket, not to the launch services provider or the spaceport. For example, Soyuz launches by Arianespace in Kourou are counted under Russia because Soyuz-2 is a Russian rocket. 5 10 15 20 25 30 Antares Ariane Atlas Delta Falcon H-II Long March PSLV R-7 R-36 UR Others   Antares 100   Ariane 5   Atlas V   Delta II   Delta IV   Delta IV Heavy   Falcon 9   H-IIA   H-IIB   Long March 2   Long March 3   Long March 4   PSLV   Soyuz-U   Soyuz-FG   Soyuz-2 (Russia)   Soyuz ST (Europe)   Dnepr   Proton-M   Rokot   Strela   Others 5 10 15 20 25 30 China France India International waters Israel Japan Kazakhstan Russia United States   Jiuquan   Taiyuan   Xichang   Kourou   Satish Dhawan   Ocean Odyssey   Palmachim   Tanegashima   Uchinoura   Baikonur   Dombarovsky   Plesetsk   Cape Canaveral   Kennedy   MARS   Vandenberg 10 20 30 40 50 Transatmospheric Low Earth Medium Earth Geosynchronous / transfer High Earth Heliocentric   Transatmospheric   Low Earth   Low Earth (ISS)   Low Earth (SSO)   Low Earth (retrograde)   Medium Earth   Geosychronous (transfer)   Inclined GSO   High Earth   Heliocentric Bergin, Chris.
