Cartosat-2E is an Earth observation satellite developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and is the seventh in the Cartosat series. It is designed to collect high-resolution, large-scale imagery for use in urban planning, infrastructure development, utilities planning, and traffic management. Cartosat-2E carries three primary instruments: the Panchromatic Camera (PAN), the High-Resolution Multi-Spectral radiometer (HRMX), and the Event Monitoring camera (EvM). Panchromatic camera (PAN) is capable of taking panchromatic (black and white) photographs in a selected portion of the visible and near-infrared spectrum (0.50–0.85 µm) at a resolution of 65 cm (26 in). High-Resolution Multi-Spectral (HRMX) radiometer is a four-channel radiometer sensitive across the entire visible spectrum and part of the near-infrared spectrum (0.43–0.90 µm) at a resolution of 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Event Monitoring camera (EvM) is also capable of capturing minute long video of a fixed spot as well, Event Monitoring camera (EvM) for frequent high-resolution land observation of selected areas. The satellite was launched on 23 June 2017, along with NIUSAT and 29 other satellites, aboard a PSLV-XL, PSLV-C38 launch vehicle from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre First Launch Pad. With a mass of 712 kg (1,570 lb), it is deployed into a 505 km (314 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit for a five-year primary mission. India has allocated ₹160 crore (US$25 million in 2017) for the project.
