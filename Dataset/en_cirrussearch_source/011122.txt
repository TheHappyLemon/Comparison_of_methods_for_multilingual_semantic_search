The Plater family is a German and Polish noble family originating from Westphalia, whose members first settled in Livonia and later in Lithuania and Poland. The family was first documented in 1274 with knight Hinricus de Broyle and later in 1392 with Rötger von dem Broel genannt Plater. Their original seat was Broel [de] in County of Mark, hence the family's name was von dem Broel. The part of the family that moved in 15th century to Livonia used the name Plater or the combined Broel-Plater. The Plater-Zyberk branch line was founded by Michał Plater-Zyberk, who married Izabela Helena Syberg zu Wischling (1785-1849), daughter of Jan Tadeusz Syberg zu Wischling [pl], the last male representative of the Syberg family. In order to save his wife's family name, he adopted her surname and the coat of arms. The Platers returned to Catholicism in the 17th century and held high offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and achieved magnate status in the 18th century, with six representatives of the family achieveing a seat in the Senate. The basis of the family's importance in Polish Livonia was the uninterrupted holding of the post of starosta in Dyneburg since 1670.
