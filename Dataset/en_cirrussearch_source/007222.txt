Augusts Kirhenšteins' younger brother, Rūdolfs Kirhenšteins (1891–1938), went on to become a Soviet intelligence officer who was arrested and shot during the Great Terror. In 1888, Augusts Kirhenšteins attended school at the Riga Alexander Boys Gymnasium. He then studied at the Tartu Veterinary Institute (1893-1901), publishing his first scientific work while still pursuing his studies. He joined the student fraternity Selonija, later switching to the fraternity Zemgalija. In 1901, he graduated from the institute and worked as a veterinarian in Valmiera and Limbaži.
