Turkey is a presidential republic with a multi-party system. Major parties are defined as political parties that received more than 7% of the votes in the latest general election and/or represented in parliament. Minor parties are defined as political parties that have fulfilled the requirements of the Supreme Election Council[citation needed] (Yüksek Seçim Kurulu in Turkish, abbreviated as YSK) and whose names have been listed on ballots. Forming a political party without prior permission is a constitutional right, but the Interior Ministry may delay registering a new party for years, so the party cannot stand in elections. If the ID and serial number of a person's Turkish identity card is known, anyone can query their political party membership via the website of the General Prosecution Office of the Supreme Court of Appeal or mobile phone messages. General information about the parties holding seats in the Grand National Assembly as of June 2023: Other parties eligible to contest in elections (by March 2023) General information on other political parties registered in the Ministry of Interior: The following parties are inactive, and they are not listed in the active political parties list by the Supreme Court of Appeal. These are some of the parties that were dismantled because of their internal dynamics, mergers, inability to find electoral base or through governmental intervention, for instance following the Turkish coups d'état. These are some of the parties that were banned through extraordinary courts or the Constitutional Court of Turkey.
