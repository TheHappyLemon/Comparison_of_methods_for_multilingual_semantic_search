Mads Pedersen (born 18 December 1995) is a Danish professional racing cyclist, who rides for UCI WorldTeam Lidl–Trek. He is a sprinter who has won stages in all three Grand Tours — the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, and Vuelta a España. He won the men's road race at the 2019 UCI Road World Championships in Yorkshire, England, becoming the first Danish cyclist to win the men's World Championship road race title. In 2013, Pedersen won the Paris–Roubaix Juniors and went on to claim the silver medal in the World Championships junior road race. Pedersen won Ghent–Wevelgem U23, the U23 Tour of Norway, and a stage of the Tour de l'Avenir prior to turning professional. In August 2016 Trek–Segafredo announced that they had signed Pedersen through to 2018. In his neo-pro season, he was named in the start list for the 2017 Giro d'Italia. He also become national champion of Denmark, and took overall victory in the Tour du Poitou Charentes after winning the time trial. In September 2017, Pedersen took overall victory at the Danmark Rundt. In April 2018, he finished in second place in the Tour of Flanders following a spirited break away. Pedersen attacked ahead of the Koppenberg with just over 50 kilometres (31 miles) remaining, and was joined by Dylan van Baarle (Team Sky) and Sebastian Langeveld (EF Education First–Drapac p/b Cannondale). Eventual winner Niki Terpstra (Quick-Step Floors) caught and passed Pedersen on the final ascent of the Oude Kwaremont and rode to victory, but Pedersen was strong enough to hold off world champion Peter Sagan (Bora–Hansgrohe) and the chasing peloton to become the youngest podium finisher in 40 years. On 29 September 2019, Pedersen won the World Road Race Championship in a rain-soaked race, in and around Harrogate, in Yorkshire, England. He is the first Danish cyclist to win a men's world championship road race title. In August 2020, he was named in the startlist for the 2020 Tour de France. He did not win any stages and held the white jersey for best young rider for one day. After the Tour was over he won a stage and the points classification in the 2020 BinckBank Tour, and won the 2020 Gent–Wevelgem. Both of these races were held late in the season due to the COVID pandemic. In 2021 he won Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne and took a stage victory in the Tour of Norway. In 2022 he won the points classification in Circuit de la Sarthe and Étoile de Bessèges and had top 10 finishes in Milan–San Remo, the Tour of Flanders and Gent–Wevelgem. During the 2022 Tour de France he was very active early in the race as the Grand Départ was held in his home country of Denmark, however he had no luck. At the end of the second week he got involved in a breakaway where he and teammate Quinn Simmons formulated a plan and bridged up to what eventually became a seven rider breakaway. Simmons drove a hard pace up the Coté de Saint-Romain-en-Gal and with just under 11 km to go Pedersen launched an attack. Only Fred Wright and Hugo Houle could go with him. As the finish line approached Pedersen overpowered both of them, and easily won the sprint to claim the stage win. 2012 1st Overall Tour of Istria 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 3 1st Overall Trofeo Karlsberg 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 3a (ITT) 1st Overall Sint-Martinusprijs Kontich 1st Points classification 1st Young rider classification 1st Prologue & Stage 4 3rd Overall Liège–La Gleize 4th Overall Course de la Paix Juniors 10th Paris–Roubaix Juniors 2013 1st Overall Course de la Paix Juniors 1st Points classification 1st Stages 2a (ITT) & 4 1st Overall Trofeo Karlsberg 1st Stages 3a (ITT), 3b & 4 1st Paris–Roubaix Juniors Aubel–Thimister–La Gleize 1st Mountains classification 1st Stage 3 2nd Road race, UCI Junior Road World Championships 2nd Road race, National Junior Road Championships 2nd Overall Sint-Martinusprijs Kontich 1st Stage 4 2nd Overall Grand Prix Rüebliland 1st Stage 4 10th Overall Giro della Lunigiana 1st Stage 4 2014 1st Eschborn-Frankfurt City Loop U23 3rd Time trial, National Under-23 Road Championships 2015 1st Stage 2 Tour de l'Avenir 2nd Overall ZLM Roompot Tour 1st Stages 2 (TTT) & 3 6th Overall Four Days of Dunkirk 6th La Côte Picarde 8th Overall Tour des Fjords 9th Ronde van Vlaanderen Beloften 2016 (1 pro win) 1st Fyen Rundt 1st Kattekoers Tour of Norway 1st Mountains classification 1st Stage 3 5th Road race, National Road Championships 7th Poreč Trophy 8th Overall Three Days of De Panne 1st Young rider classification 2017 (5) 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st Overall Danmark Rundt 1st Points classification 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 3 1st Overall Tour du Poitou-Charentes 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 4 (ITT) 2018 (4) 1st Tour de l'Eurométropole 1st Fyen Rundt 1st Stage 2 Herald Sun Tour 1st Stage 4 (ITT) Danmark Rundt 2nd Tour of Flanders 5th Dwars door Vlaanderen 7th GP Horsens 2019 (2) 1st Road race, UCI Road World Championships 1st Grand Prix d'Isbergues 2020 (3) 1st Gent–Wevelgem 1st Stage 2 Tour de Pologne 4th Road race, National Road Championships 5th Overall BinckBank Tour 1st Points classification 1st Stage 3 7th Race Torquay Tour de France Held after Stage 1 2021 (3) 1st Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 1st Stage 3 Tour of Norway 2nd Overall Danmark Rundt 1st Points classification 1st Stage 2 2nd Bredene Koksijde Classic 3rd Eurométropole Tour 2022 (9) 1st Fyen Rundt Vuelta a España 1st Points classification 1st Stages 13, 16 & 19 Tour de France 1st Stage 13 Combativity award Stage 13 Circuit de la Sarthe 1st Points classification 1st Stages 1 & 3 Étoile de Bessèges 1st Points classification 1st Stage 1 1st Stage 3 Paris–Nice National Road Championships 2nd Road race 4th Time trial 2nd Grand Prix La Marseillaise 3rd GP Herning 6th Milan–San Remo 7th Overall Tour of Belgium 1st Points classification 1st Stage 1 7th Gent–Wevelgem 8th Tour of Flanders 10th Road race, UEC European Road Championships 2023 (7) 1st Overall Danmark Rundt 1st Points classification 1st Stage 5 (ITT) 1st Hamburg Cyclassics 1st Stage 8 Tour de France 1st Stage 6 Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 2 Paris–Nice 1st Stage 5 (ITT) Étoile de Bessèges 2nd Grand Prix d'Isbergues 3rd Tour of Flanders 3rd Münsterland Giro 4th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 4th Paris–Roubaix 5th Gent–Wevelgem 5th Dwars door Vlaanderen 6th Milan–San Remo 7th Road race, UEC European Road Championships 2024 (7) 1st Overall Tour de la Provence 1st Points classification 1st Prologue, Stages 1 & 2 1st Overall Étoile de Bessèges 1st Points classification 1st Stage 3 1st Gent–Wevelgem 4th Milan–San Remo "Trek-Segafredo confirm signing of Mads Pedersen". cyclingnews.com. 8 August 2016.
