Galerida is a genus of birds in the family Alaudidae. The current scientific name is derived from Latin. Galerida was the name for a lark with a crest, from galerum, "cap". The name Galerida is synonymous with the earlier genus names Calendula, Heliocorys and Ptilocorys. The genus Galerida was established by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1828. The type species was subsequently designated as the crested lark. The genus contains seven species: There are at least two fossil species which are included in this genus: †Galerida bulgarica (late Pliocene of Varshets, Bulgaria) †Galerida pannonica (Pliocene of Csarnota, Hungary) Formerly, some authorities also considered the following species (or subspecies) as species within the genus Galerida: Short-tailed lark (as Galerida fremantlii) Dunn's lark (as Calendula dunni) Wikimedia Commons has media related to Galerida.
