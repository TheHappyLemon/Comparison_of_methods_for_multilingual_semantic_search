Sara Kolak (born 22 June 1995) is a Croatian track and field athlete who competes in the javelin throw. She won gold at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Her personal best of 68.43 m, set in 2017, is the Croatian record. It also ranks her tenth on the overall list. Kolak won bronze medals at both the European and World Junior Championships. She qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics, where she won the gold medal, setting a new national record of 66.18 metres. She has since bested her own record, with a 68.43 m throw in 2017. She also won the 2017 European U23 Championship and placed fourth in the final at the 2017 World Championships in London. Following the 2017 World Championships, Kolak struggled with an elbow injury. The Croatian Olympic Committee approved a $150,000 funding for her surgery, which was carried out in Minnesota, US. After the surgery, she underwent rehabilitation of the ligaments and returned to competition in the summer of 2019. She has qualified to compete for Croatia at the 2020 Summer Olympics.
