Takehiro Tomiyasu (冨安 健洋, Tomiyasu Takehiro, born 5 November 1998) is a Japanese professional footballer who plays as a defender for Premier League club Arsenal and the Japan national team. Mainly a full-back, he can be also be deployed as a centre-back. Beginning his career at Avispa Fukuoka, Tomiyasu had a spell with Belgian club Sint-Truiden and Italian club Bologna before joining Arsenal in 2021. Having previously played for various youth levels, Tomiyasu received a call-up for Japan's senior team in 2018. He featured for the side that reached the final of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, and also played at the 2022 FIFA World Cup and 2023 Asian Cup. Born in Fukuoka, Japan, Tomiyasu was first scouted by the Sanchiku Kickers’ general manager Kanji Tsuji, who was impressed with his performance, especially his speed. Following this, Tsuji convinced his parents to let him play football, which led Tomiyasu to be enrolled at Sanchiku Elementary School. When he was eleven, Tomiyasu was recommended for a trial at FC Barcelona Soccer Camp by his coach. He impressed at the trial so FC Barcelona offered him a place on the club's youth academy, but it was difficult for him to relocate to Spain and the move was cancelled. Despite this, Tomiyasu said the experience at the Soccer Camp was "inspiring". After failing to join FC Barcelona, Tomiyasu joined Avispa Fukuoka. Initially playing in the midfield position, he switched to centre back. During his time at Avispa Fukuoka's youth system, Tomiyasu had a period as the club captain. He impressed at the 2013's JFA Premier Cup, and was named in the Best Eleven as a result. In May 2015, it was announced that Avispa Fukuoka had registered Tomiyasu. After appearing in two matches as an unused substitute, he made his debut for the club on 14 October 2015 as a starter in a 2–0 loss against Machida Zelvia in the third round of the Emperor's Cup. At the end of the 2015 season, Tomiyasu signed a temporary contract with Avispa Fukuoka. At the start of the 2016 season, Tomiyasu spent the first half of the J League season on the substitute bench. Tomiyasu made his first appearance of the season on 20 April 2016, as a starter in the defensive midfield position, in a 0–0 draw against Vegalta Sendai in the J League Cup. However, in the J. League Cup match against Sagan Tosu, Tomiyasu was sent off for a second bookable offence in a 1–1 draw. Two months later, on 13 July 2016, he made his league debut for the club, starting in the defensive midfield position in a 2–1 win against FC Tokyo. After making his debut for the club, Tomiyasu became a regular for the side, usually playing in the defensive midfield position. It was reported on 26 September 2016 that he had become the second player in the league to be the fastest player at 12.436 km in. Following the club's relegation to J. League 2, Tomiyasu went on to make sixteen appearances in all competitions. At the end of the 2016 season, Tomiyasu had his contract with the club renewed. In the 2017 season, Tomiyasu became a regular for the side, playing at centre back. He then scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–1 win against Roasso Kumamoto on 19 March 2017. Despite being absent from the first team, due to international commitment, Tomiyasu continued to regain his first-team place for the club for the rest of the season. He then helped Avispa Fukuoka three clean sheets in three matches between 29 July 2017 and 11 August 2017. Tomiyasu later helped the club qualify for the J1 League Promotion Playoffs, having finished fourth place in the league. He helped the side beat Tokyo Verdy 1–0 to reach the semi–finals of the J1 League Promotion Playoffs. In the final of the J1 League Promotion Playoffs against Nagoya Grampus, Tomiyasu played 90 minutes, as they drew 0–0 but saw Avispa Fukuoka unsuccessfully promoted to J. League One. At the end of the 2017 season, Tomiyasu went on to make thirty–nine appearances and scoring once in all competitions. It was announced on 8 January 2018 that Tomiyasu would be moving abroad for the first time in his career by joining Belgian First Division A side Sint-Truiden. He signed a three and a half year contract with the club, keeping him until 2021. Upon joining the club, Tomiyasu said: "I want to become a special player in Belgium." After spending months at training and recovering from an ankle injury, Tomiyasu made his Sint-Truiden debut for the club, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2–1 win against Royal Antwerp on 12 May 2018. This turned out to be his only appearance of the 2017–18 season. In the 2018–19 season, Tomiyasu made his first start for Sint-Truiden and played the entirety of a 0–0 draw against Cercle Brugge in the opening game of the season. Since the start of the season, he became a regular for the side, playing at centre back. Between 23 September 2018 and 30 September 2018, Tomiyasu kept three consecutive clean sheets in three matches. Tomiyasu scored his first goal of the season on 25 November 2018 in a 4–2 win against Anderlecht. After spending January on international duty with Japan, Tomiyasu returned to Sint-Truidense on 9 February 2019, starting and playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 win against Waasland-Beveren. He continued to retain his place in the team for the rest of the 2018–19 season. His performance received praise from the Belgian media. As a result, he won the club's Player of the Year. In his second season at Sint-Truidense, Tomiyasu made 40 appearances and scored once in all competitions. It was reported on 29 June 2019 that Bologna agreed a €9 million deal to sign Tomiyasu. The transfer move was confirmed on 9 July 2019 and Tomiyasu became the second Japanese player to join the club after Hidetoshi Nakata. Upon joining the club, he said: "Impression that the defensive tactics are detailed. The striker level is also very high. I chose this team because I wanted to learn individual defense tactics. First I wanted to be on the pitch." Tomiyasu made his Bologna debut, playing the whole game, in a 3–0 win against Pisa in the first round of the Coppa Italia. A week later, he made his league debut, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–1 draw against Hellas Verona, and was named Man of the Match for his performance. Having made three appearances, he was named August's Player of the Month. He started in the first league seven matches before suffering a hamstring injury in October that kept him out for a month. On 24 November, he made his return to the starting lineup in a 2–2 draw against Parma. Since joining the club, Tomiyasu quickly established himself in the starting line-up playing at right back, and his performances impressed the Italian media and supporters alike. By the time the season was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, he had made 20 appearances in all competitions. Tomiyasu remained an integral part of the club once the season resumed behind closed doors. He scored his first goal for Bologna in the 44th minute with his left foot, in a 5–1 loss against Milan on 18 July 2020. In a follow–up match against Atalanta, Tomiyasu suffered a hamstring injury and was substituted in the 74th minute, as the club lost 1–0. After the match, it was announced that he would be sidelined for the rest of the 2019–20 season. Despite this, Tomiyasu finished his first season at Bologna, making 30 appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Ahead of the 2020–21 season, Tomiyasu's performances last season led to suggestions that he could be playing in the centre–back position. Tomiyasu soon recovered from his injury and regained his first-team place, playing at centre back. In a match against Sassuolo on 18 October 2020, he scored an own goal after a cross from Giorgos Kyriakopoulos, leading to the winning goal for the opposition team. In December, Tomiyasu began playing at right back for the rest of the season, though he occasionally played as a left back and centre back. This was due to his struggles playing at centre back, resulting in criticism by the Italian media. His performances began to improve as a result of the tactical change. Tomiyasu scored his first goal of the season in a 2–2 draw against Atalanta on 23 December. Two weeks later on 6 January 2021, he scored his second goal of the season, scoring from a header, in a 2–2 draw against Udinese. However, Tomiyasu suffered a calf injury that saw him out for two weeks. He made his return to the starting line–up two weeks later than expected on 14 March against Sampdoria, starting in a 3–1 win. His return was short–lived when he suffered a muscular problem against Inter Milan on 4 April. After being sidelined for a month, he made his return to the starting line–up on 2 May against Fiorentina and played 76 minutes before being substituted, in a 3–3 draw. By the end of the season, he had made 33 appearances and scoring two times in all competitions. Ahead of the 2021–22 season, Tomiyasu was linked with a move to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and Atalanta. Amid the transfer speculation, he made his only appearance of the season against Atalanta, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute, in a 0–0 draw on 28 August 2021. On 31 August 2021, Tomiyasu joined Premier League side Arsenal on a four-year deal, with an option for a fifth. The transfer was variously reported as £15.5million, £16 million and £17 million. Upon joining the club, both manager Mikel Arteta and technical director Edu commented about the player, describing him as an "important member of the squad" at Arsenal. He became the fourth Japanese player to sign for Arsenal after Junichi Inamoto and Ryo Miyaichi; others such as Takuma Asano never managed to feature in a competitive senior fixture for Arsenal. On 11 September, he made his first appearance for Arsenal against Norwich City in a 1–0 win. Tomiyasu was named Arsenal's Player of the Month for September 2021, with 51% of the vote. On 21 August 2023, Tomiyasu started in Arsenal's 1–0 win at Crystal Palace. He was controversially sent off in the 67th minute for two bookable offences. On 27 September, he was finally used as a centre back for Arsenal in the 2023–24 EFL Cup third round match against Brentford and contributed to a 1–0 clean sheet victory. On 28 October, he scored his first goal for Arsenal in the 96th minute of stoppage time in a 5–0 victory over Sheffield United. On 2 November, he was selected as the team's monthly MVP for October by fan voting, making it his second award since September 2021. On 20 March 2024, he extended his contract with the club until 2026.

Along the way, he suffered ankle injury, but it did not affect his chances to be in the Olympics squad. Tomiyasu made his debut in the tournament against France Olympic team on 28 July 2021 and started the whole game to help Japan win 4–0.

On 9 September 2023, in a friendly match against Germany, which was his first international match following the World Cup, he displayed solid defence in a 4–1 away victory, in which he was awarded player of the match. Playing in either at centre back or right back, Tomiyasu is known for being physical, as well as his strong defending structure. He's also known for his versatility, capably playing at left back due to his two-footedness. His performance at Sint-Truiden was so impressive that Voetbal Nieuws named him "The Best Eleven of Foreign Players Who Have Left from the Jupiler League". Former teammate Pol García praised Tomiyasu for his attitude, while former Italy international defender Cristian Zaccardo praised his strong and energetic performances. Bologna's technical coach Emilio De Leo said about Tomiyasu's performances, saying: "He has the ability to read and manipulate time and space in a modern way." The club manager Marco Di Vaio agreed, saying: "Tomiyasu immediately impressed us because he is very good with his feet and knows how to adapt to all defense roles." National Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport praised Tomiyasu's performance, saying: "He is a treasure. The key to reinforcing Bologna". Manuel Minguzzi, a reporter for Tuttobologna, said about his performance: "Fans can always expect maximum professionalism and commitment from Tomiyasu. As a full back he did very well, while as a central he made some mistakes, but in Serie A it is quite normal because adaptation is needed. Tomiyasu also possesses great qualities when building the game. I was very struck by the fact that in the first year of Serie A he immediately became the protagonist. He had been taken as a center back but was often used at full back offering both phases of play. As soon as he arrived he became an idol. The Japanese market is always very active on social networks and Bologna has expanded its popularity thanks to Tomiyasu." Former Japan manager Alberto Zaccheroni praised manager Siniša Mihajlović for using Tomiyasu regularly in the first team, saying: "He was good but not malicious, Mihajlovic did a great job making him play a full back year, in less risky areas, and then use him as a central player after gaining experience." Tomiyasu has two sisters. He was planning to follow in his sisters' footsteps by becoming a professional swimmer before switching to football instead, stating that he wanted to be a footballer. In his first press conference in Bologna, Tomiyasu said he began to learn Italian and asked the media to call him Tomi. By February 2020, Italian media Corriere Di Bologna reported that Tomiyasu already spoke Italian.
