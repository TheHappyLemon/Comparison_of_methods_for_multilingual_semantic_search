She later starred in Lifetime Television original series Angela's Eyes, which was cancelled on December 1, 2006. In the following years, she began playing guest roles on several television series, including CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, How I Met Your Mother, Private Practice and Castle.

In early 2011, she landed the lead role on ABC drama pilot Grace by Krista Vernoff.

Spencer appeared in a recurring role as Dr. Erin Jameson on the TNT series Hawthorne in 2010, and from 2011 to 2019 had a recurring role as Dana "Scottie" Scott, Gabriel Macht's character's old rival, on the USA Network legal drama Suits.

Spencer received critical acclaim for starring as Amantha Holden in the Sundance Channel original drama series Rectify (2013–2017). She was nominated for Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her performance in the series. Spencer played the lead role in the indie drama A Beautiful Now, written by Daniela Amavia, about a passionate dancer who finds herself considering an extreme act when she reaches a crossroads in her life.

In 2014, Spencer appeared opposite Jason Bateman in the comedy-drama film This Is Where I Leave You, an ensemble comedy directed by Shawn Levy, and starred with John Travolta and Christopher Plummer in the crime thriller film The Forger. In October 2014, Spencer joined the cast of the second season of HBO crime drama series, True Detective. In 2016, Spencer was cast as lead character Lucy Preston in the NBC series Timeless, where she plays a history professor sent on time travel missions to different eras in an effort to prevent others from disrupting the U.S.-related timestream. A review of the series in Variety called Spencer "prodigiously talented" and that she played "a character whose major personality traits are 'smart' and 'plucky.'" A review by Deadline Hollywood said that the show was a waste of Spencer's talents. The New York Times wrote that "Abigail Spencer is good as Lucy, the spunky historian who is the show's central character." Timeless was renewed by NBC on May 12, 2017. The network had canceled the series days earlier, but reversed the decision. The series ended after two seasons. Spencer and Duke Johnson's production company, Innerlight Films, has produced award-winning short films such as Here and Now, and the 2015 Oscar short-listed Winter Light. The company has also produced the upcoming film The Actor, based on Donald E. Westlake's novel Memory, starring André Holland and Gemma Chan. Spencer married Andrew Pruett in 2004 and gave birth to their son in 2008. They filed for divorce in February 2012, divorcing in 2013.
