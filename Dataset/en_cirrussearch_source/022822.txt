It is located in the southwest of the oblast and borders with Gatchinsky District in the north, Tosnensky District in the northeast, Novgorodsky and Batetsky Districts of Novgorod Oblast in the southeast, Shimsky District, also of Novgorod Oblast, in the south, Plyussky District of Pskov Oblast in the southwest, Slantsevsky District in the west, and Volosovsky District in the northwest. The area of the district is 6,006.44 square kilometers (2,319.10 sq mi). Its administrative center is the town of Luga. Population (excluding the administrative center): 40,166 (2010 Census); 41,885 (2002 Census); 48,721 (1989 Census). The area of the district is mostly flat with altitudes ranging from 0 to 100 meters (0 to 328 ft) above sea level. Almost the whole area of the district belongs to the basin of the Luga River, a tributary of the Gulf of Finland. The main tributaries of the Luga within the district are the Oredezh (right), the Saba (left), and the Yashchera (right). Some areas in the south and the southwest of the district belong to the river basin of the Plyussa River, a right tributary of the Narva, and rivers in the minor areas in the east of the district drain into the Tosna River, a left tributary of the Neva. There are many lakes in the district, the most significant of them being Lakes Vyale, Vrevo, and Cheremenetskoye. In the northeast of the district, the Mshinskoye Boloto Zakaznik was created to protect the swamp landscape with the pine-tree forest. The zakaznik is shared with Gatchinsky District. Originally, the area of the district was populated by Finnic peoples, in particular, the Votes. From the 8th century, the Slavs began arriving. The Luga River was first mentioned in chronicles under 947. In the following, the area was dependent on the Novgorod Republic (from the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Moscow). It was desolated during the Livonian War but recovered. In 1617, according to the Treaty of Stolbovo, the north of the area was transferred to Sweden, the border was drawn at the Oredezh and Luga Rivers. and in the 1700s, during the Great Northern War, it was conquered back by Russia. The city of Saint Petersburg was founded in 1703. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, Novgorod Governorate split off. The eastern part of the area was a part of Novgorodsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate. In 1772, the western part of the area was transferred to the newly established Pskov Governorate, which in 1777 was transformed to Pskov Viceroyalty. Luga was founded in 1777, and until 1782 belonged to Pskov Viceroyalty. In 1782, it became the administrative center of Luzhsky Uyezd of Saint Petersburg Governorate (renamed Petrogradsky in 1913 and Leningradsky in 1924). In 1918, important events of the Russian Civil War took place in the area, when the White Army unsuccessfully tried to conquer Petrograd. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Luzhsky District, with the administrative center in the town of Luga, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Luga Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. It included parts of former Luzhsky and Gatchinsky Uyezds.

On January 1, 1932 parts of Plyussky District which was abolished were transferred to Luzhsky District; consequently, minor parts of Luzhsky District were transferred to Lyadsky and Krasnogvardeysky Districts. On February 15, 1935 Plyussky District was re-established, and most of the areas were transferred back to this district. On September 19, 1939 Luga was made town of oblast significance and was not anymore a part of the district. Between August 1941 and February 1944, during World War II, the district was occupied by German troops. In 2010, the administrative division of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with the municipal division, and Gatchina was made the town of district significance. On August 1, 1927, Oredezhsky District, with the administrative center in the settlement of Oredezh, was established as well. It was a part of Luga Okrug of Leningrad Oblast and included parts of former Trotsky and Luzhsky Uyezds, as well as of Novgorodsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate. Between August 1941 and February 1944 the area of the district was occupied by German troops. On October 22, 1959 Oredezhsky District was abolished and split between Luzhsky and Gatchinsky Districts.

Between August 1941, and February 1944, Osminsky District was occupied by German troops. On August 2, 1961 Osminsky District was abolished and split between Slantsevsky and Volosovsky Districts.
