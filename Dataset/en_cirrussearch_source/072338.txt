This article shows a list of cities in Denmark by population. The population is measured by Statistics Denmark for urban areas (Danish: Byområder), defined as a contiguous built-up area with a maximum distance of 200 meters between houses, unless further distance is caused by public areas, cemeteries or similar. Furthermore, to obtain the status of being a city (byområde), the area must have at least 200 inhabitants. Smaller settlements are by Danmarks Statistik included in numbers for rural areas (landdistrikter).[failed verification] List of urban areas in Sweden by population List of towns and cities in Norway List of urban areas in the Nordic countries World's largest cities List of municipalities of Denmark "Statistics Denmark".
