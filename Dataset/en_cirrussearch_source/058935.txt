Mauro da Silva Gomes (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈmawɾu ˈsiwvɐ]; born 12 January 1968), known as Mauro Silva, is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder. A hard-working player with great stamina, as well as tackling and leadership skills, he was best known for his spell with Deportivo. He amassed competitive totals of 458 games and one goal over 13 La Liga seasons, winning six major titles. Silva represented Brazil at the 1994 World Cup and two Copa América tournaments, winning the former tournament. Silva was born in São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo. After starting playing with Guarani he moved to Bragantino in 1990, where he spent the following two seasons. Subsequently, he was acquired up by Spain's Deportivo de La Coruña, for 250 million pesetas (approximately €1.6 million), arriving at the same time as countryman Bebeto. Silva was an everpresent fixture with the Galicians, only suspensions and injuries preventing him from being cast into the starting XI – in the 1994–95 campaign he only appeared in six La Liga matches and, already 26, was limited to 20 in his final year – as he helped them to one league, two cups and three supercups, adding to this the team's five participations in the UEFA Champions League, reaching the semi-finals in 2003–04: after a 0–0 away draw against FC Porto he missed the second leg due to suspension, and Depor lost 1–0. On 22 May 2005, after 13 years with Deportivo, Silva was replaced by longtime understudy Aldo Duscher during a 3–0 home loss against RCD Mallorca, bidding farewell to the Estadio Riazor and football in the same match as another club legend, Fran. In December 2016, as Deportivo celebrated its 110th anniversary, Silva was chosen by club fans as the best player in its history. With Brazil, Silva collected 59 caps over ten years, making his debut in 1991. He played in every match and minute (except for the second half of the group stage match against Sweden) in his nation's victorious campaign at the 1994 FIFA World Cup; in the same year, he was named by FIFA as the ninth best player in the world. According to the organisation, the lack of attacking play in the final of the tournament against Italy was in part down to strong holding midfield play by Dino Baggio for Italy, and Dunga and Mauro Silva for Brazil; following a 0–0 draw after extra-time, Brazil won the match in a penalty shoot-out.
