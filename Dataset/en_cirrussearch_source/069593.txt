Going in Style is a 2017 American remake of the 1979 comedy film of the same name. Directed by Zach Braff and written by Theodore Melfi, it stars Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Alan Arkin, Joey King, Matt Dillon, Christopher Lloyd, Ann-Margret, John Ortiz and Siobhan Fallon Hogan. It follows a trio of retirees (Freeman, Caine, and Arkin) who plan to rob a bank after their pensions are canceled. The film premiered at the SVA Theatre on March 30, 2017, and was released in the United States on April 7, 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $84 million worldwide against its $25 million budget. Joe, Willie, and Albert are senior citizens and lifelong friends living in NYC. During an unpleasant appointment at the bank, Joe is one of the witnesses to a robbery in progress carried out by three individuals wearing black masks. During the robbery, Joe notices the leader bearing a Mongol warrior tattoo on his neck, the only lead that could help the police identify the culprit. The man sympathizes with Joe when he finds out about his current financial situation brought on by the bank. The robbers escape with over $1.6 million. When the company where the friend trio worked is bought out, their pensions become a casualty of the restructuring. Joe is hit particularly hard and finds out that he, his daughter Rachel and granddaughter Brooklyn, will be homeless in less than thirty days. Willie finds out he is gravely ill from kidney failure and needs a transplant. He's even more frustrated because his financial situation forces him into a long-distance relationship with his daughter and granddaughter. Desperate, the three friends decide to rob the bank restructuring their pension funds and take back what is rightfully theirs. Inspired by experiencing the robbery, Joe originates the idea; at first Albert and Willie are appalled, but eventually agree when they later learn that their bank intends to steal their pensions. Trying to shoplift some items from a grocery store, where Al's love interest Annie works, results in a comic disaster. So, the trio turn to Joe's former son-in-law Peter Murphy, and professional criminal and pet store owner Jesús to teach them the ropes. They plan on using the lodge's carnival as a cover. Joe, Willie, and Albert disguise themselves as "The Rat Pack" (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr.) and use guns with blanks so no one gets hurt. The robbery almost goes awry when Willie collapses briefly and Lucy, a child witness, partially pulls off his mask to help him breathe better. She sees the watch he wears with a picture of his granddaughter on it, so he engages in a friendly conversation and makes her feel less intimidated. The trio manages to take over $2.3 million. However, they are soon arrested on suspicion by FBI Agent Hamer, as the grocery store manager recognizes Al's walk from the video surveillance cameras, but they all stick to their alibis. Hamer puts them, along with other senior suspects, into a police lineup, for Lucy to identify the robbers. She refuses to identify Willie, leaving Hamer with no case. Willie suffers total kidney failure and is near death until Al agrees to donate a kidney. While part of the money is used to help the three friends with their financial situations, the rest is given to their families, friends, co-workers, and fellow members at the lodge. Joe finally gets his granddaughter a puppy he promised her if she got A's in every subject at school; courtesy of Jesús, who is later revealed to be the leader of those from the robbery Joe witnessed and helps launder the money that they stole. The tattoo on Jesus' neck is also revealed to be a fake made of henna, intended to throw the FBI and the police off the scent.

Jeremy Bobb as Donald Lewis On October 12, 2012, it was announced that New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. were developing a remake of 1979 heist comedy film Going in Style, with Theodore Melfi set to write the script. Donald De Line was on board to produce the film with Tony Bill, producer of the original film, as executive producer. Melfi was approached by De Line and Andrew Haas about writing the screenplay for the remake, but Melfi insisted on changing the ending to something more upbeat. Melfi explained: In this modern era, and even for me, I don't want to see a movie where my heroes whom I've been fighting for and rooting for for two hours die or go to jail. I want to see them get ahead, and it's perfect for them to get ahead these days because everyone hates banks now. So let's have them put the perfect heist together, rob a bank, get away with it, and go off into the sunset. They said, 'Yes, let's do that,' and that's how that script was born. On January 9, 2013, Don Scardino was hired to direct the film. On September 19, 2013, Melfi, who wrote the script was in talks to direct the film.
