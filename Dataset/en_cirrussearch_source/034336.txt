Helene Weigel (German: [heˈleː.nə ˈvaɪ̯gl̩] ; 12 May 1900 – 6 May 1971) was a German actress and artistic director. She was the second wife of Bertolt Brecht and was married to him from 1930 until his death in 1956. Together they had two children. Weigel was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, the daughter of Leopoldine (née Pollak) and Siegfried Weigel, an accountant-general in a textile factory. Her family was Jewish. She and husband Brecht had two children, Stefan Brecht and Barbara Brecht-Schall. Weigel was a Communist Party member from 1930. Weigel became the artistic director of the Berliner Ensemble on 16 February 1949.[citation needed] She is best remembered for creating several Brecht roles, including: Pelagea Vlassova, The Mother of 1932; Antigone in Brecht's version of the Greek tragedy; the title role in his civil war play, Señora Carrar's Rifles; and the iconic Mother Courage.[citation needed] Between 1933 and 1947, as a refugee from Adolf Hitler's Germany, she was seldom able to pursue her acting craft, even during the family's six-year period in Los Angeles.[citation needed] It was only with the foundation of the Berliner Ensemble in East Germany in 1949 that Brecht's theatre began to be recognized worldwide.[citation needed] She died in 1971, still at the helm of the company, and many of the roles that she created with Brecht are still in the theatre's repertoire today.[citation needed] Weigel died in East Berlin on 6 May 1971, six days before her 71st birthday.
