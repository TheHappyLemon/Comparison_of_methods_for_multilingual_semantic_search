The piña colada (/ˌpiːnjə koʊˈlɑːdə, -nə-, -kə-/; Spanish: piña [ˈpiɲa], "pineapple", and colada [koˈlaða], "strained") is a cocktail made with rum, cream of coconut, and pineapple juice, usually served either blended or shaken with ice. It may be garnished with either a pineapple wedge, maraschino cherry, or both. The drink originated in Puerto Rico. The name piña colada (Spanish) literally means "strained pineapple", a reference to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice used in the drink's preparation. The earliest known story states that in the 19th century, Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofresí, to boost his crew's morale, gave them a beverage or cocktail that contained coconut, pineapple and white rum. This was what would be later known as the famous piña colada. With his death in 1825, the recipe for the piña colada was lost. Historian Haydée Reichard disputes this version of the story. In 1950, The New York Times reported that "Drinks in the West Indies range from Martinique's famous rum punch to Cuba's pina colada (rum, pineapple and coconut milk)." The Caribe Hilton Hotel claims Ramón "Monchito" Marrero created the Piña Colada in 1954 while a bartender at the hotel. According to this account, Marrero finally settled upon the recipe for the Piña Colada, which he felt captured the true nature and essence of Puerto Rico. The hotel was presented with a proclamation in 2004 by Puerto Rico Governor Sila M. Calderón celebrating the drink's 50th anniversary. A Spaniard by the name of Ricardo Garcia also claims to have invented the drink in 1953, while working at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan. Barrachina, a restaurant in Puerto Rico, says that "a traditional Spanish bartender Don Ramon Portas Mingot in 1963 created what became the world's famous drink: the Piña Colada." In 1978, Puerto Rico proclaimed the cocktail to be its official drink. As recounted by his friends in José L. Díaz de Villegas's book, the original Monchito recipe was to pour 85 grams of cream of coconut, 170 grams of pineapple juice and 43 grams of white rum into a blender or shaker with crushed ice, blend or shake very well until smooth, then pour into chilled glass and garnish with pineapple wedge and/or a maraschino cherry. There are many recipes for piña colada. The International Bartenders Association specifies it as Ingredients (5 parts) 5 cl (1.7 US fl oz) white rum (3 parts) 3 cl (1.0 US fl oz) coconut cream (5 parts) 5 cl (1.7 US fl oz) pineapple juice Method Mix with crushed ice in blender until smooth, then pour into a chilled glass, garnish and serve. Alternately, the three main components can simply be added to a cocktail glass with ice cubes. In San Juan, Puerto Rico, a different recipe is used: Ingredients 1 US fl oz (3.0 cl) heavy cream 6 US fl oz (18 cl) frozen freshly pressed pineapple juice 1 US fl oz (3.0 cl) cream of coconut 2 US fl oz (5.9 cl) rum Method Freeze pineapple juice before use. In a blender, combine cream of coconut, frozen pineapple juice, heavy cream and rum. Pour in a desired 12-ounce container and use a cherry and fresh pineapple for a garnish. Different proportions of the core ingredients, as well as different types of rum, may all be used in the piña colada. Frozen piña coladas are also served. Other named variations include Lava Flow or Miami Vice – strawberry daiquiri and piña colada layered in one glass. Scotsman colada – substitute Scotch for rum. Tepache colada – a piña colada variation using tepache developed by JungleBird in Santurce, Puerto Rico. Recipe calls for 1.5 oz gold rum, 2 oz tepache and 1.5 oz coconut cream. In the United States, National Piña Colada Day is celebrated on 10 July. The cocktail gained worldwide fame after Rupert Holmes' 1979 song, "Escape (The Piña Colada Song)", became an international hit. Piña coladas are referred to in the 2023 Eurovision entry Cha Cha Cha by Finnish rapper Käärijä, in which he describes drinking piña coladas after an exhausting week, before letting himself go on the dancefloor. The song led to an increased popularity of the drink in Finland. Liquor portal Puerto Rico portal Coco López Ramón López Irizarry "piña colada". Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary.
