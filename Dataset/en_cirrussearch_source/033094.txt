Julio Bolbochán (Buenos Aires, 20 March 1920 – Caracas, 28 June 1996) was the Argentine chess champion in 1946 and 1948. He learned the game from his older brother, Jacobo Bolbochán, later an International Master. He represented Argentina in seven Chess Olympiads from 1950 to 1970. Bolbochán earned the International Master title in 1950 and the International Grandmaster title in 1977. He had several successes at Mar del Plata: shared first with Erich Eliskases in 1951, shared first with Héctor Rossetto in 1952, and shared first with Miguel Najdorf in 1956. Bolbochán qualified to play in the Sousse interzonal but didn't participate due to the Argentine Chess Federation not having enough funds to send him. After 1976 he lived as a chess teacher in Venezuela. He represented Venezuela in the 1977 Maccabiah Games, 1981 Maccabiah Games, 1985 Maccabiah Games, and 1989 Maccabiah Games. He was the chess coach at the Universidad Simón Bolívar Chess Club for over 20 years. This section uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
