Iași International Airport (IATA: IAS, ICAO: LRIA) is an international airport located in Iași, Romania, 8 km (5 mi) east of the city centre. One of the oldest accredited airports in Romania and the most important in the historical region of Moldavia, Iași Airport is the third-busiest airport in Romania in terms of passenger traffic. The Iași region earned its commercial representative status on 24 June 1926, when scheduled flights commenced on the route Bucharest – Galați – Iași – Chișinău. The flights were operated by Compagnie Franco-Roumaine de Navigation Aérienne - CFRNA, in 1930 renamed LARES. In 1966, a north–south concrete runway, 15/33, with a total length of 1,800 m (5,906 ft), and a modern lighting system, were built, followed three years later by the construction of a passenger terminal. In 2001, the passenger terminal was upgraded to use separate flows for domestic and international flights. In June 2012, a new passenger terminal, named T2, was added, increasing the total processing capacity to 215 pax/hour. The terminal was designated to be used for Schengen/domestic flights. The old terminal has been renamed T1. In 2013, Iași International Airport started a long-term, multi-stage upgrade program. Module I of the project (an estimated €57 million investment) was completed in November 2015, and involved the construction of a new runway, a terminal building, and the extension of the apron. On 20 August 2014, the first 1,800 m (5,906 ft) of the new runway 14/32 went into operation, whilst the entire length of 2,400 m (7,874 ft) became fully operational on 16 October 2014. The old runway 15/33 was converted into a taxiway. On 17 October 2015, the third terminal building (T3) with a processing capacity of 320 pax/hour and two boarding gates, was inaugurated. A project which includes the expansion of T2 (that would double the terminal's area) was also proposed, in October 2015. On 13 November 2017, Iași Airport exceeded the 1,000,000 passenger mark. In March 2021, an extension of the apron was completed and a new taxiway was inaugurated. The airport experienced a surge in traffic in February 2022, as Moldova closed its airspace due to the Russian Invasion of Ukraine. Due to the airport's proximity to the Moldovan border, many airlines decided to reroute their flights to Chișinău to Iași's airport, while other airlines announced plans to increase the number of destinations served from Iași. On 9 May 2022, a contract of over €66 million was signed with Strabag for the design and execution of the T4 passenger terminal and the extension of the parking lot. Opened on 29 March 2024, T4 has an area of 31,210 m2 (335,942 sq ft), a processing capacity of 3.3 million passengers/year, and seven gates (three jetways and four ground-loading gates). For the long term, the development project proposes other modules for the construction of a new apron, two rapid-exit taxiways, a cargo terminal, an aircraft fuel depot, a new access roadway, as well as of a 600-metre (2,000 ft) extension for the runway to a total length of 3,000 m (9,843 ft). The airport facilities consist of four terminals. Passenger operations take place in the main terminal T4, used for all Schengen/domestic flights, and T3, used for non-Schengen flights. The old terminal T1 functions as office/administrative and storage space, while there are plans for the former domestic terminal T2 to be converted into a cargo terminal. Iași Airport sits at an elevation of 411 feet (125 m). There is one runway at the airport, aligned in the north–south direction. On the airport grounds, Aerostar provides aircraft maintenance services at its center opened in September 2020.
