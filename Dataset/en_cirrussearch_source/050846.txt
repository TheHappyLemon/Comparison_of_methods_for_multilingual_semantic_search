In English, it is also known as Cape Nao. Cap de la Nau is in the municipality of Xàbia, within the Mediterranean province of Alicante, in the comarca of Marina Alta, and is the easternmost point of the Valencian Community. It marks the southern limit of the Gulf of Valencia, and points towards the nearby island of Formentera in the Balearic Islands. The cape is rocky, steep and mostly composed of limestone. Beneath the headland there is a large cave, known as Cova dels Orgues (or Cueva de los Órganos in Spanish) that can only be approached from the sea. Lighthouse Atop the headland, at an elevation of 120 metres (390 ft), stands the Cap de la Nau lighthouse, providing an important aid to navigation.
