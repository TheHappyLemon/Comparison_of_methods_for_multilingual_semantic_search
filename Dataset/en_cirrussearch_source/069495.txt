Remi Francis Wolf (born February 2, 1996) is an American singer and songwriter from Palo Alto, California. As a senior in high school, she appeared as a contestant on American Idol in 2014. After completing her undergraduate music studies in 2018, she made her solo debut with the self-released extended play You're A Dog! in October 2019. Wolf subsequently released her second EP and major-label debut, I'm Allergic To Dogs!, on Island Records and Virgin EMI Records in June 2020, followed by her debut studio album, Juno, in October 2021. Her sophomore album Big Ideas, is scheduled for a release on July 12, 2024. Wolf was born in Palo Alto, California, on February 2, 1996, to a Sicilian mother and a Russian-Persian father. At around the age of eight she became interested in competitive skiing; she represented the US in alpine skiing at the Youth Olympic Games for two consecutive years. When she was 14, Wolf formed her first band with a friend. They called it Remi and Chloe (later, Remi, Chloe, & The Extracts). As a senior at Palo Alto High School, Wolf appeared as a contestant during the audition rounds on the thirteenth season of American Idol in 2014, but, without any formal dismissal, did not reappear later on in the show. At age 17, she moved to Los Angeles, where she attended the USC Thornton School of Music, graduating in 2018 at the age of 22. Wolf met producer Jared Solomon (also known as Solomonophonic) while in high school and began collaborating with him thereafter. Her first single, "Guy," was produced by Solomon and was released in 2019. Off the success of that song, Wolf opened for Still Woozy on his tour in April of that year. She also toured with Cautious Clay and performed at both the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books and Viva Pomona! later in 2019. She released her first EP, You're a Dog!, in September 2019. She was later signed to Island Records, a division of the Universal Music Group. Her first single as an Island signee, "Woo!", was released in April 2020. That was followed by the singles "Photo ID" and "Disco Man". Those tracks would go on to appear on Wolf's second EP, I'm Allergic to Dogs, released in June 2020 via Island. "Photo ID" accrued numerous streams and shares on TikTok throughout 2020. In November 2020, her single, "Hello Hello Hello" was featured in an ad for the iPhone 12. In May 2021, she released, We Love Dogs!, a remix EP with guest appearances from acts like Sylvan Esso, Beck, Dominic Fike, Hot Chip, and others. Later in 2021, Wolf began releasing new singles, including "Liquor Store," "Grumpy Old Man," and "Quiet on Set." These would appear on her major label debut studio album, Juno, released via Island in October 2021. In March 2022, she released the single, "Pool," with Still Woozy. Later that year, Wolf opened for Lorde on the North American leg of her "Solar Power" tour. In June 2022, Wolf released a "deluxe" version of Juno with 4 additional tracks. That month, she toured throughout Europe, including a stop at the Firenze Rocks festival in Florence, Italy where she performed with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nas. Those dates constituted the first leg of Wolf's "GWINGLE GWONGLE" tour, which had stops across North America later in the fall of 2022. In August 2022 in collaboration with Spotify, Wolf released the Live at Electric Lady EP, a collection of six live songs, including a cover of Frank Ocean's "Pink + White." In November 2022, Wolf announced her first tour of Australia and New Zealand during which she is scheduled to play multiple festivals and a handful of headlining shows in December 2022 and January 2023. Wolf performed at the 22nd Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2023. Her hit song Monte Carlo was featured in the Netflix movie You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah in August 2023 A new single "Cinderella", was released in March 2024, and an album, Big Ideas announced for a July 2024 release. Musically, Wolf performs in what she describes as a "funky soul pop" genre. In a 2021 interview, she stated she wants to "constantly try to innovate the sound of pop music" and "erase the rules of pop". The New York Times wrote that she turns the bedroom pop genre into "hypercolored explosions". Wolf cites Still Woozy, SZA, and John Mayer as musical influences. Wolf is bisexual. She has been based in Los Angeles, California, since circa 2014. In June 2020, she was checked into rehab for alcoholism issues. She claims to have been sober ever since, and that in past instances she frequently drank to the point of blacking out; although she could easily function in daily life, she had started fighting with family, friends and collaborators. She has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. "BMI Repertoire: WOLF REMI FRANCIS". Broadcast Music, Inc. Archived from the original on August 17, 2020. Retrieved August 17, 2020.
