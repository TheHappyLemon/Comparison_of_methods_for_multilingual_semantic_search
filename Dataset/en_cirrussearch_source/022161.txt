Snowboarding at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi was held at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park. The events were held between 6 and 22 February 2014. A total of ten snowboarding events were held at Sochi 2014 which include parallel giant slalom, snowboard cross, half-pipe, and the new events of parallel slalom and slopestyle. A crash in practice from Norwegian slopestyle snowboarder Torstein Horgmo, who fractured his collarbone, and complaints from other athletes that some jumps were too steep prompted organisers to modify the slopestyle course in the week before the Games. The following is the competition schedule for all ten events. All times are (UTC+4).   *   Host nation (Russia) A total of 252 quota spots were available to athletes to compete at the games.
