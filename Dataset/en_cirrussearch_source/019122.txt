After signing with the Buffalo Sabres, Tallinder made his North American debut in the 2001–02 season with AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans. He was recalled in his first season appearing in 2 scoreless games for the Sabres. Tallinder suffered a broken left arm in game 3 of the Sabres Eastern Conference finals against the Carolina Hurricanes and missed the remainder of the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs. At the time of the injury, he was tied for the NHL playoff lead in plus/minus at +14. During the 10th game of the 2006–07 season, Tallinder broke the same arm during a game against the New York Islanders. During a game against New Jersey on 6 February 2008, he became the first Sabres defenceman to score in a shootout, scoring against Martin Brodeur. On 1 July 2010, Tallinder signed a four-year, $13.5 million contract with the New Jersey Devils. On 7 July 2013, Tallinder was traded back to the team that drafted him, the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Riley Boychuk. In September 2014, Tallinder would sign a tryout with the Toronto Maple Leafs, however, he suffered an injury in a preseason game against his former team, the Sabres, and was ultimately released without a contract. After playing in four games with the New York Rangers AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, Tallinder signalled the end of his North American career in returning to Europe and agreeing to a contract with the ZSC Lions of the NLA. On October 9, 2018, Tallinder officially announced his retirement after 22 professional seasons.

In 2005, Tallinder, and fellow Swedish hockey players Kristian Huselius and Andreas Lilja were investigated on suspicion of sexual exploitation. In March 2005, all three players were suspended from the Swedish national team for one year, with Huselius and Tallinder being released by Swedish club Linköping. Lilja was not suspended by Swedish club Mora, but decided to take a break for the remainder of the rest of the season. Initially police had dropped their investigation within two days 11 February 2005 when a 22-year-old woman accused the trio of raping her 9 February, because of a lack of evidence. However, a special prosecutor reopened the case in March, leading to the suspensions. Tallinder and the others were cleared in June of that year.
