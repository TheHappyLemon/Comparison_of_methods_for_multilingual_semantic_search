The 1985–86 European Cup was the 31st season of UEFA's premier club football tournament, the European Cup. The European Champion Clubs' Cup was won by Steaua București on penalties in the final against Barcelona. Steaua București became the first Eastern Bloc side to win the tournament. The final was decided mainly by goalkeeper Helmuth Duckadam, who (after keeping a clean sheet in the final) saved all four of Barcelona's penalties to secure the cup. Juventus, the defending champions, were eliminated by Barcelona in the quarter-finals. No clubs from England were entered into the competition during this year, owing to a ban from European competition in light of the Heysel Stadium disaster. Had the ban not been imposed, Everton would have represented England. The Belgian club Anderlecht received a bye from the first round. 18 September 1985 Stadion Śląski, Chorzow Attendance: 50,800 Referee: Gérard Biguet (France) 18 September 1985 Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion, East Berlin Attendance: 19,875-21,000 Referee: Marcel Van Langenhove (Belgium) 18 September 1985 Grawnd Nazzjonali Ta' Qali, Ta' Qali Attendance: 2,751 Referee: Mircea Neşu (Romania) 18 September 1985 Illovszky Rudolf Stadion (1960) Attendance: 1,500 Referee: Plarent Kotherja (Albania) 18 September 1985 Vejle Stadion, Vejle Attendance: 4,500 Referee: Werner Föckler (West Germany) 18 September 1985 Kirov Stadium, Leningrad Attendance: 51,000 Referee: Berisha Şinasi (Yugoslavia) 18 September 1985 Lahden Stadion, Lahti Attendance: 2,000 Referee: Klaus Peschel (East Germany) 18 September 1985 Windsor Park, Belfast Attendance: 2,898 Referee: Ib Nielsen (Denmark) 18 September 1985 Attendance: 1,871 Referee: Thorbjørn Aas (Norway) 18 September 1985 Ullevi, Gothenburg Attendance: 11,192 Referee: Neil Midgley (England) 18 September 1985 Parc Lescure, Bordeaux Attendance: 18,982 Referee: José dos Santos (Portugal) 18 September 1985 Stadion Letná, Prague Attendance: 30,501 Referee: Ulf Eriksson (Sweden) 18 September 1985 Estádio das Antas, Porto Attendance: 50,000 Referee: Pietro D'Elia (Italy) 18 September 1985 Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi, Verona Attendance: 26,998 Referee: Horst Brummeier (Austria) 18 September 1985 Stade Municipal, Luxembourg Attendance: 8,000 Referee: Philippe Mercier (Switzerland) 2 October 1985 Olympiastadion, Munich Attendance: 13,500 Referee: Howard King (Wales) Bayern Munich won 6–2 on aggregate. 2 October 1985 Attendance: 9,500 Referee: Robert Wurtz (France) Austria Wien won 4–1 on aggregate. 2 October 1985 GSP Stadium, Nikosia Attendance: 7,798 Referee: Dimitar Charlatchki (Bulgaria) Omonia won 10–0 on aggregate. 2 October 1985 Glenmalure Park, Dublin Attendance: 4,500 Referee: Alan Ferguson (Scotland) Budapest Honvéd won 5–1 on aggregate. 2 October 1985 Stadionul Steaua, Bucharest Attendance: 20,000 Referee: Rosario Lo Bello (Italy) Steaua București won 5–2 on aggregate. 2 October 1985 Bislett Stadion, Oslo Attendance: 2,482 Referee: Osmo Orakangas (Finland) Zenit Leningrad won 4–0 on aggregate. 2 October 1985 Olimpijski Gradski Stadion Koševo, Sarajevo Attendance: 9,000 Referee: Hristos Kolokithas (Greece) Kuusysi won 4–2 on aggregate. 2 October 1985 Stade des Charmilles, Geneve Attendance: 11,600 Referee: Bela Szabo (Hungary) Servette won 4–3 on aggregate. 2 October 1985 Pittodrie Stadium, Aberdeen Attendance: 14,709 Referee: John Kinsella (Ireland) Aberdeen won 7–2 on aggregate. 2 October 1985 Kolezha, Plovdiv Attendance: 25,000 Referee: André Daina (Switzerland) IFK Göteborg won 5–3 on aggregate. 2 October 1985 İnönü Stadyumu, Istanbul Attendance: 40,000 Referee: Edvard Sostarić (Yugoslavia) Fenerbahçe won 3–2 on aggregate. 2 October 1985 Camp Nou, Barcelona Attendance: 42,000 Referee: Karl-Heinz Tritschler (Germany) 2–2 on aggregate;
