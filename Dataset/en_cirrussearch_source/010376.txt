Zbyněk Irgl (born November 29, 1980) is a Czech professional ice hockey player currently with HC Olomouc of the Czech Extraliga.

The selection meant little for the Predators as Irgl has played his entire professional career in Europe, first in the Czech Extraliga for HC Vítkovice, in 2007-2010 for Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the KHL. In 2010-11 Irgl Zbyněk played for Atlant Moscow Oblast of the KHL.
