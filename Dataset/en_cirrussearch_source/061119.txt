Cristian Gabriel "Cuti" Romero (born 27 April 1998) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and the Argentina national team. He is known for his aggressive play style, ability on the ball, and dominance in aerial duels. Coming through the youth system, Romero began his senior career in 2016 at Belgrano. He moved to Italy in 2018, playing for Genoa. Romero was purchased by Juventus the following season; he was sent back on loan to Genoa, before being sent on loan to Atalanta in 2020. After being nominated Serie A Best Defender in 2020–21 with Atalanta, the club exercised the option of purchase before promptly loaning Romero to Tottenham with an obligation to buy. After a successful loan spell, Romero was signed by Tottenham in 2022. Romero represented Argentina at youth level at the 2017 South American U-20 Championship. He made his senior debut in 2021, and was a key member of the squad that won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Having joined the youth team in 2014, Romero was promoted to Argentine Primera División side Belgrano's first team in 2016; his debut came on 28 August, in a league match with Independiente. A month later, Romero played in both of Belgrano's 2016 Copa Sudamericana round of sixteen ties against Coritiba. In two seasons with Belgrano's first-team, he made nineteen appearances in all competitions. In July 2018, Romero joined Genoa of Serie A. Romero scored his first senior goal in his second Genoa match, netting in a 2–2 draw with Udinese on 28 October, a match in which he was later sent off. On 9 July 2019 Juventus announced Romero was having a medical ahead of a proposed transfer. On 12 July 2019, Juventus announced the permanent acquisition of Romero from Genoa for €26 million, with the player remaining at his former club on loan for the rest of the season. On 5 September 2020, Romero joined Atalanta on loan until 30 June 2022 with an option to buy. He was elected the best defender of the 2020–21 Serie A season. On 6 August 2021, Juventus announced that Atalanta had activated the option to sign Romero for €16 million. Later that day, Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur announced his signing from Atalanta on an initial season-long loan with an option to make the deal permanent. Romero made his debut for the club on 15 August, coming on as a late substitute for Pierre-Emile Højbjerg in a match against Manchester City that Tottenham won 1–0. On 19 August 2021, he made his first start in the UEFA Europa Conference League first leg tie against Paços de Ferreira, which ended in a 1–0 defeat. Romero scored his first goal for Tottenham Hotspur in a 2–0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion. On 30 August 2022, he joined Tottenham Hotspur on a permanent deal with a contract lasting until 2027. Ahead of the 2023–24 Premier League season, Romero was named as one of Tottenham’s vice-captains. Romero made a strong start to the season, being described by manager Ange Postecoglou as the “rock” in Tottenham’s defence, and earning a nomination for the Player of the Month award in October. However, on 6 November 2023, Romero was shown a straight red card during Tottenham’s 4–1 loss to rivals Chelsea. It was his fourth red card since moving to the Premier League, more than any other player in that time. Romero scored on his return from suspension, Tottenham's only goal in a 2–1 loss to West Ham United. Romero has represented Argentina at U20 level, winning seven caps at the 2017 South American U-20 Championship in Ecuador. In April 2017, he was called up for Argentina's training camp ahead of the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup in South Korea but was not selected on the tournament squad list. Romero was called up for the U23s in September 2019. Romero made his debut for the senior national team on 3 June 2021 in a World Cup qualifier against Chile, playing the full match. In his following game for Argentina on 8 June, he scored his first international goal, coming from a thumping header against Colombia after only 130 seconds. This goal also broke the record for the fastest ever scored for Argentina in a professional match, surpassing Diego Maradona's goal after 168 seconds against Venezuela in 1985. In June 2021, he was included in Lionel Scaloni's final Argentina 28-man squad for the 2021 Copa América. Romero was included in the Team of the Tournament at the conclusion, as Argentina won the competition. Romero was also an integral part of the Argentinian team which won the 2022 FIFA World Cup, in which he started in six out of seven matches including the final. Romero has been described as a "proactive" defender always playing on the "front foot." This allows him to step up in the backline and make crucial interceptions in midfield. He is well-known for his decision-making in his risky style of play. However, this makes him highly vulnerable to disciplinary issues the few times he does not time a tackle or an interception at the right time.
