He later moved to Ireland, where he lived for one year, and began to write solo material. In 2012, Pojavis began to record his debut album in Massive Arts studio in Milan, Italy. The first single "Traukiniai" was later that year, ranking within the top twenty of the Lithuanian Singles Chart, and its music video was aired on national television. Following this success, Pojavis released his debut album "Aštuoni" to both commercial and critical acclaim in Lithuania.
