Aleksandar Prijović (Serbian Cyrillic: Александар Пpиjoвић, pronounced [aleksǎːndar prǐːjoʋitɕ, alěksaːn-]; born 21 April 1990) is a Serbian professional footballer who last played as a striker for A-League club Western United. Born in Switzerland, Prijović played for the Serbia national team and also played for both Serbia and Switzerland in youth levels. Prijović started his career as a youth player with his hometown club St. Gallen but moved to Italy at the age of 16 to start his football career with Italian side Parma, making the first appearance of his career as a substitute for Parma on 27 April 2008 in a match against Reggina. Prijović's contract with Parma finished at the end of the 2007–08 Serie A season and he rejected the offer of a new one-year deal with the club.[citation needed] Prijović went on trial with English Championship side Derby County where he caught the eye by scoring a hat-trick as Derby's academy side beat Arsenal youth 4–1. Derby offered Prijović a two-year contract. He provisionally signed for Derby on 7 August 2008, subject to international clearance. His full signing was delayed by issues over international clearance, firstly following disagreements over the player's registration which was sorted when Derby agreed to pay Prijović's former club, Parma, an undisclosed amount as compensation and then by the Swiss army, who made Prijović return home to complete his spell with them. On 27 January 2009, Prijović joined League One Yeovil Town on a months loan, playing four times before returning early due to illness. On 16 March, Prijović joined Northampton Town on loan for a month. He made his debut in the 4–0 win over Stockport County and impressed the fans. He scored his first professional goal in the 3–2 defeat to Southend United. He then scored his second in the 3–1 victory away at Leyton Orient. On 6 July 2009, he was called for a trial period with Germany-based club MSV Duisburg before he joined OB Odense on a similar deal in November 2009, where he impressed with a goal in a trial match. Of Prijović, Derby boss Nigel Clough said "They are very interested in taking him in January so we are just trying to get a deal done if they want to do one. If not, we will probably look to get him out on loan. If we can do it before the deadline, we will do. If not, in January." He eventually signed for FC Sion for a nominal fee on 1 February 2010. While on loan at Lausanne, he went on a trial with the Norwegian club, Molde at their training camp in Marbella, Spain in February 2012. He played one match for Molde, the pre-season match against the Spanish club Xerez CD, but was not offered a contract. On 31 July 2012, Tromsø signed Prijović on a one-year loan deal, with an option to buy. Tromsø's head coach Per-Mathias Høgmo stated that Molde's manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær and coach Mark Dempsey had recommended Prijovic after the trial. Prijović got his debut coming in off the bench for the last 22 minutes of an away loss to Fredrikstad on 5 August. Four days later he made his first start and scored his first goal in the away leg of the third qualifying round of the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League against Metalurh Donetsk, ensuring a 2–1 aggregate win for Tromsø. Tromsø could not afford to extend Prijović' loan-deal, and he returned to Sion when the loan-deal expired on 1 July 2013. On 15 August 2013, Prijović signed a 2+1⁄2-year contract with the Stockholm-based club Djurgårdens IF, where he was reunited with his coach from Tromsø, Per-Mathias Høgmo. In his starting debut for Djurgårdens IF Prijović scored a hattrick, when IFK Norrköping was beaten 3–2. On 9 July 2015, Prijović joined Legia Warsaw on a four-year deal. During the 2015–16 Polish Cup Final on 2 May 2016, he scored the match winner in the 69th minute to defeat Lech Poznan 1–0. On 22 November 2016, he scored two goals in the 2016–17 Champions League group match against Borussia Dortmund as his team lost 8–4 away from home. On 16 January 2017, Prijović left Legia Warsaw to join Greek Super League club PAOK on a 4+1⁄2-year contract. The reported transfer fee paid to Warsaw was €1.9 million plus 10% of a future transfer fee, receiving an annual income of €850,000. He started being the undisputed leader of the club's offence. He scored on his debut in a Greek Cup game against Panetolikos. On 19 February 2017, he scored a brace (pen. 42', 50'), PAOK won easily 4–0 against Veria at Toumba Stadium. On 16 March 2017, Prijovic suffered a shoulder injury and underwent a successful operation, the club confirmed.

During the 2017–18 season, Prijovic's brilliant form for both club and country has attracted interest from foreign teams. Rumours are circling that Prijovic is in demand, but it's doubtful that PAOK would be willing to sell, especially given the difficulty of finding a worthy replacement. PAOK fans are hoping that Prijovic can continue firing on all cylinders as the Greek title race heats up. On 6 January 2018, he scored a brace in a glorious 5–0 home win game against Levadiakos On 9 January 2018, Prijovic netted home a penalty in the fourth minute of second half stoppage to give PAOK a 2–1 victory over Trikala in their second leg fixture in the Greek Cup, scoring for second time in the game.

On 27 February 2018, an official transfer bid from Chinese club Henan Jianye arrived at the headquarters of the Greek Cup winners about the 28-year-old Serbian for an estimated amount of €9 million, but PAOK was not interested in selling him and Aleksandar Prijović also decided to remain at Superleague, with a contract ran until the summer of 2022 worth €1.5 million per year and contained a €10 million buy-out clause, even if the Chinese team were offering him the same contract with a lucrative annual salary of €4 million. On 28 February 2018, Prijovic deservedly doubled PAOK's advantage in a 3–1 away win against Panionios in the Greek Cup semi-final, planting a bullet header expertly beyond the helpless Matic Kotnik from Dimitris Limnios' left-wing cross.
