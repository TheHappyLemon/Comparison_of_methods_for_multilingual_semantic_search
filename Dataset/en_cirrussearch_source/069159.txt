This article outlines notable events occurring in 2004 in spaceflight, including major launches and EVAs. Flight 15P of SpaceShipOne (X0) was the first privately funded human spaceflight. It took place on June 21, 2004. It was the fourth powered test flight of the Tier One program, with the previous three test flights reaching much lower altitudes. The flight carried only its pilot, Mike Melvill, who thus became the first non-governmental astronaut. The first launch of the Delta IV Heavy on 21 December 2004 carried a boilerplate payload and was a partial failure. Cavitation in the liquid-oxygen propellant lines caused shutdown of both boosters eight seconds early, and the core engine nine seconds early; this resulted in a lower staging velocity for which the second stage was unable to compensate. The payload was left in a lower than intended orbit. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Ariane Atlas Delta Long March R-7 R-14 R-36 Universal Rocket Zenit Others   Ariane 5   Atlas II   Atlas III   Atlas V   Delta II   Delta IV Heavy   Long March 2   Long March 3   Long March 4   Molniya-M   Soyuz-U   Soyuz-FG   Kosmos-3M   Dnepr   Tsyklon-2   Tsyklon-3   Proton-K   Proton-M   Zenit-2   Zenit-3SL   Others   5 10 15 20 China France India International waters Israel Kazakhstan Russia United States   Jiuquan   Taiyuna   Xichang   Kourou   Satish Dhawan   Ocean Odyssey   Palmachim   Baikonur   Plesetsk   Cape Canaveral   Kennedy   Vandenberg 5 10 15 20 25 30 Transatmospheric Low Earth Medium Earth Geosynchronous / transfer High Earth Heliocentric   Transatmospheric   Low Earth   Low Earth (ISS)   Low Earth (SSO)   Low Earth (retrograde)   Medium Earth   Geosychronous (transfer)   Inclined GSO   High Earth   Heliocentric Bergin, Chris.
