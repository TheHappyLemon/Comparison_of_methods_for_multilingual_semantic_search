Eragrostis minor, the little lovegrass or smaller stinkgrass, is a widespread species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae, native to most of the subtropical and warm temperate Old World, and introduced to North America, South America, and Australia. Preferring disturbed open places with little competition, and sandy or gravelly soils, it is often found growing on rail embankments, road verges, cracks in sidewalks, and waste areas. Its seeds are edible, but quite small and difficult to harvest and handle, so it is usually regarded as a famine food.
