Brescia Calcio, commonly referred to as Brescia (Italian pronunciation: [ˈbreʃʃa ˈkaltʃo]), is an Italian football club based in Brescia, Lombardy, that currently plays in Serie B, the second tier of Italian football. The club holds the record for total number of seasons (64) and consecutive seasons (18, from 1947–48 to 1964–65) in Serie B, which they have won four times. Their best finish in Serie A came in the 2000–01 season when they placed eighth. At the beginning of the 21st century, led by the 1993 Ballon d'Or winner Roberto Baggio, the club also qualified for the Intertoto Cup twice, reaching the final in 2001 but being defeated on away goals by Paris Saint-Germain. During this era, Pep Guardiola, former Barcelona captain and later a highly decorated manager, also played for the club. The team's colours are blue and white. Its stadium is the 19,550-seater Stadio Mario Rigamonti. They have a long-standing rivalry with Atalanta from nearby Bergamo. The team was founded in 1911 as Brescia Football Club, joining the Terza Categoria division the same year.[citation needed] In 1913, Brescia was promoted to First Division for the first time, and from 1929 they played in Serie A for six of the seven following seasons.[citation needed] Successively, the club played among the two top divisions until 1982, when Brescia was relegated to Serie C.[citation needed] The club then returned to Serie B in 1985.[citation needed] Brescia played outside the two divisions of Lega Calcio (Serie A and B) only four years; under this aspect, only 11 clubs in all Italy marked a better performance.[citation needed] Brescia won the Anglo-Italian Cup in 1994, the biggest achievement in their history to date.[citation needed] Brescia actually[tone] came to the footballing forefront only in 2000, when the previously unfancied club signed former FIFA World Player of the Year Roberto Baggio, who led Brescia to a seventh-place finish in the 2000–01 season, thus qualifying for the UEFA Intertoto Cup.[citation needed] Successively, Brescia reached the Intertoto Cup finals, then lost to Paris Saint-Germain via the away goals rule after achieving a 0–0 away draw in the first leg and a 1–1 home draw in the second leg. Baggio spent four years at Brescia before retiring in 2004 and during those historic four years, Brescia became widely known as "Baggio's Brescia".[citation needed] During Baggio's four-year spell with Brescia, the club recorded its best-ever run of staying in Serie A.[citation needed] In the very next season that followed Baggio's retirement (2004–05), however, Brescia were relegated from Serie A on the last day, finishing a lowly 19th.[citation needed] Brescia struggled for returning to top flight after the relegation and finally returned to Serie A after beating Torino with a 2–1 aggregate in the 2009–10 season.[citation needed] In the 2010–11 season, however, they were relegated back to Serie B.[citation needed] In the 2014–15 season, they were relegated to Lega Pro after finishing second from last.[citation needed] However, after Parma's declaration of bankruptcy and demotion to Serie D, Brescia was among the teams selected to replace them in Serie B. A new promotion to Serie A was secured in the 2018–19 season, with two games to spare. One of the most decorated managers of all time, Mircea Lucescu, the Romanian Gheorghe Hagi, striker Luca Toni, Barcelona icon Pep Guardiola, Brescian striker Mario Balotelli, defender Mario Rigamonti and playmaker Andrea Pirlo–– which were born in the province of Brescia–– have also spent time playing for the club.[citation needed] The first Brescia kit in 1911 was blue (the national colour) with a thick white vertical stripe down the middle, a design which has returned for the centenary season in 2011.[citation needed] The first appearance of a white "V" was in 1927; added so that the team could use Stadium, the newly built home of another team, Virtus.[citation needed] This style remained until 1940 when the "V" was removed and a plain blue shirt was used.[citation needed] Some substantial changes after World War II saw the shirt become plain white with blue shorts.[citation needed] This was short-lived and, in 1954, the plain blue shirt returned.[citation needed] The white "V" also returned eventually in 1961 as a show of goodwill by the new chairman at the time.[citation needed] The "V" disappeared again in 1969; replaced by a diagonal white sash, and returned, but much smaller, in 1974 for two years. The "V" was situated over the heart with the inclusion of the lioness, the symbol of the city of Brescia. The shirt remained plain blue until 1991, when the "V" returned and has been used ever since. The first badge appeared on Brescia kits in the 1980s; a blue crest with a golden outline featuring a lion.[citation needed] The city of Brescia is known as Leonessa d'Italia (the Lioness of Italy) after ten days of popular uprising that took place in the city in the spring of 1849 against Austrian rule.[citation needed] The crest was changed for the centenary of Brescia Calcio in 2011, featuring higher visibility, leaves, and a substantial redesign of the old logo.[citation needed] The thick profile of the gold shield and laurel branches surrounding the badge are in pure celebration of achieving 100 years of age.[citation needed] The lettering has changed in favour of a font in the style of the period when the team was founded.[citation needed] The Lion that, due to a misunderstanding of history,[clarification needed] many[who?] believe to be a lioness (the definition of Leonessa d'Italia was assigned to Brescia following the uprisings, but the lion as a symbol of Brescia dates back to the Republic of Venice), has undergone a total redesign which aims to fix some errors in heraldic iconography (the absence of nails, muscle weakness and weak curvature of the tail) and to restore a more toned and ferocious looking lion, the symbol a football team should[why?] have. 1913/14 – North League Qualifying round Group E 5th place 1914/15 – North League Qualifying
