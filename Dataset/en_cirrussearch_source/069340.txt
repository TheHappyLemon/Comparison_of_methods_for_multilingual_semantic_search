Joachim Trier (Norwegian pronunciation: [ˈjùːɑˌkɪm ˈtɾìːəɾ]) (born 1 March 1974) is a Danish-born Norwegian filmmaker. His films have been described as "melancholy meditations concerned with existential questions of love, ambition, memory, and identity." He has received numerous nominations including for a Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, two Cesar Awards, and three Cannes Film Festival Awards. He is best known for his Oslo trilogy which comprises the films Reprise (2006), Oslo, August 31st (2011), The Worst Person in the World (2021). For the last film, he was nominated for the Best Original Screenplay at the 94th Academy Awards, with the film also nominated for Best International Feature. He is also known for directing Louder Than Bombs (2015), Thelma (2017), and the documentary The Other Munch (2018). Trier was born in Denmark to Norwegian parents and raised in Oslo, Norway. His father, Jacob Trier, was the sound technician of The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix, a notable film produced in Norway in 1975. His grandfather was Erik Løchen, artistic director of Norsk Film from 1981 to 1983 and also a filmmaker and screenwriter known for such experimental work as his 1972 film Remonstrance, which was constructed so that its five reels could be shown in any order, rendering 120 possible versions of its radical story of a film crew trying to make a political film. As a teenager, Trier was a skateboarding champion who shot and produced his own skateboarding videos. He studied at the European Film College in Ebeltoft, Denmark and at the National Film & Television School in the United Kingdom. Trier started his career writing and directing short films. His early short films include Pietà (2000) and Still (2001). After graduating from National Film and Television School Trier directed the short film Procter, a thriller revolving around a man who watches a suicide on a videotape and investigates the mystery surrounding the incident. The film premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival where he gained prominence winning the Best British Short Award. Ellen Margrethe Sand of Verdens Gang praised Trier writing, "[He] utilises the scarcely allotted time and his film medium to the last drop". The short would also earn nominations for the European Film Award for Best Short Film and the Amanda Award in Norway. Trier's debut film, Reprise, is about two aspiring writers and their volatile relationship. Released by Miramax in 2006, it received Norway's top film awards, the Amanda Award and the Aamot Statuette. Internationally, it won prizes at film festivals in Toronto, Istanbul, Rotterdam, Milan, and Karlovy Vary. Trier was named one of Variety's "10 Directors to Watch" in 2007. Trier gained prominence for his Norwegian drama film Oslo, August 31st (2011). His sophomore effort as a director, revolves around one day in the life of Anders (Anders Danielsen Lie), a recovering drug addict who catches up with old friends in Oslo. The film premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. The film is regarded as an adaptation of the Pierre Drieu La Rochelle novel Will O' the Wisp (1931) and Louis Malle's The Fire Within (1963). It received critical acclaim and awards and was featured on several critics' 2012 Top 10 lists. A.O. Scott of The New York Times declared it a "perfectly linear story that bristles with suspense and ambiguity". Trier was named as one of the jury members for the "Cinéfondation" and short-film sections of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. In 2015, Trier directed the English-language film Louder Than Bombs, starring Jesse Eisenberg, Gabriel Byrne, and Isabelle Huppert. It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival where it received positive reviews with acclaim for its leading performance from Huppert. His fourth feature, the supernatural horror-romance Thelma, screened at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews. Andrew Barber of Variety praised the film describing it as an, "unnervingly effective slow-burn, and those with the patience for Trier’s patient accumulation of detail will find it pays off in unexpected ways." It was selected as the Norwegian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, held in 2018. In 2018, he co-directed, with his brother, Emil, a 55-minute documentary, The Other Munch, featuring the writer Karl Ove Knausgård curating, with Kari Brandtzaerg, To the Forest, an exhibition of paintings by Edvard Munch at Oslo's Munch Museum. Trier and Knausgård visit locations from Munch's life, discuss his works, themes, obsessions, and process. The Trier brothers connect Knausgård's unorthodox interpretation of Munch to Knausgård's literary works, in a portrait of both artists. Karl Ove Knausgård stated "When I was invited to curate the exhibition, I proposed that we make a film to coincide with it." Also in 2018, Trier served as the Jury President of the Critics' Week section at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. On July 7, 2021, The Worst Person in the World premiered to high acclaim competing for the Palme d'Or at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, where star Renate Reinsve won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress. Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter praised Trier's ability as a director writing "More than ever, Trier reveals how well he can keep shifting tones and emotional arcs without losing any narrative momentum." The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film and Trier himself earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the 94th Academy Awards. In 2023 it was announced that Trier would reunite with actor Renate Reinsve for his next film, Sentimental Value, a family drama that is set to begin filming in Norway. In 2012, Trier participated in the Sight & Sound critics' poll where he listed his 10 favorite films in alphabetical order: 2001: A Space Odyssey (USA, 1968) 8½ (Italy, 1963) Annie Hall (USA, 1977) Bresson's entire oeuvre Goodfellas (USA, 1990) Hiroshima Mon Amour (France, 1959) Mirror (Soviet Union, 1974) La notte (Italy, 1961) Persona (Sweden, 1966) Vertigo (USA, 1958) Weston, Hillary.
