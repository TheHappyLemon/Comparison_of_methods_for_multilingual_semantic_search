Al Wasl Football Club (Arabic: نادي الوصل لكرة القدم) is an Emirati professional football club based in Dubai, that competes in the United Arab Emirates Football League. It is a part of the multi-sports club Al Wasl SC. The club is located in Zabeel, where it plays in Zabeel stadium. Al-Wasl is amongst the most successful teams in the UAE and Dubai, winning 7 league titles since its establishment. The club is also the host of the largest fanbase in the whole UAE. Al Wasl was founded on 1960 as Zamalek Club when a group of young men gathered in Bakhit Salem's house in Zabeel to establish the club to practice their sporting hobbies. Members had to rent a small house, each paying 10 AED to support the club's budget. In 1962, the club moved to different house owned by Madia bint Sultan, and elected Ahmed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to be their club president. Around 1966 Zamalek would beat Al Shabab in a Canada dry championship which was their first achievement. In 1974 Al Orouba agreed to merge with Zamalek to form Al Wasl Club. Al Wasl Club was ranked in 2009 by IFFHS (International Federation of Football for History and Statistics) as the Club of the Century (1901-2000) in UAE because of the club performance in international competitions. The Original Clubs Al-Zamalek The idea of starting a football club in Zabeel first emerged in 1958, as a result of discussions and meetings by various youths living in the area. The times were very difficult, as there were no grass pitches or fields to play on, as football was still not a popular pastime, so as a result, they relied on pitches made of sand, and in 1960, Al-Zamalek club was founded in Zabeel. Al-Zamalek proved to be a key contender in the city of Dubai, they were considered one of the stronger teams and regularly played in local tournaments. Their first taste of glory came around 1966 where they defeated Al-Shabab Club in the finals of the Canada Dry Challenge Cup. Al-Shou’la In 1968, Al-Shou’la in Al Fahidi merged with Al-Zamalek. Al-Orouba Al-Orouba Club was founded in the early 1950s in the Jumeirah area of Dubai, it was a key contender in Dubai along with Al-Zamalek. Their team colour was either blue or green The Merges and the formations of Al-Wasl In 1974 it would also Merge with Al-Zamalek, and a new board of directors was made from the existing bodies of each club, now joined together. A new name was chosen for the team which was Al-Wasl, which was the old name for the City of Dubai. A new logo was created for the team which essentially was a combination of the two existing club crests of Al-Orouba and Al-Zamalek, and finally, the colour yellow was chosen for the team. In 1973, A short period before the Orouba-Zamalek Merger, the first generation of footballers began to retire and/or begin their studies abroad or locally, this was a key factor in the merging of Al-Orouba and Al-Zamalek. The reason which caused many early clubs in Dubai had merged with one another was due to the clubs using the same sand pitches, and due to the moving of players from club to club freely, without official transfer negotiations as those were not done in the area at the time. Al-Wasl Fanbase Al-Wasl is known for its dedicated and loyal fans. Widely considered to be the best Fan and supporter base in the United Arab Emirates, and the Arabian Gulf simultaneously.

Ultras Junoon Al-Wasl fans have the achievement of founding the very first Ultras Group in the Arabian Gulf, which was named Ultras Junoon, Junoon meaning craziness/madness in Arabic, a description of the excitement and passion found in Al-Wasl's Stands. Ultras Junoon are also considered to be the most creative fans group in the Arabian Gulf, as their Tifos are made with nothing short of Creativity and Hard work, and frequently make headlines not only in the UAE, but also in the Middle East football scene and even all the way to Japan and Italy.
