Josef "Jupp" Heynckes (German: [ˈjʊp ˈhaɪnkəs]; born 9 May 1945) is a German retired professional footballer and manager. The majority of his player career was as a striker for Borussia Mönchengladbach in its golden era of the 1960s and '70s, when they won many national championships and the DFB-Pokal, as well as the UEFA Cup.

He was a member of the West Germany national team that won the UEFA Euro 1972 and the 1974 FIFA World Cup titles. As manager, Heynckes won four Bundesliga titles with Bayern Munich and two UEFA Champions Leagues; with Real Madrid in 1997–98 and Bayern in 2012–13, the latter of which was part of a continental treble. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time. Heynckes played 369 matches in the German Bundesliga, scoring 220 goals. His tally is the fourth highest in this league, after Gerd Müller's 365 goals, Robert Lewandowski's 312, and Klaus Fischer's 268. After playing for amateur club Grün-Weiß Holt as a youth, Heynckes started his professional career in 1964 with his hometown club Borussia Mönchengladbach who were then in the second division. In 1965, the club, managed by Hennes Weisweiler, achieved promotion to the Bundesliga, with the teenaged striker scoring 23 goals in 25 matches in his debut season. In August 1965, Heynckes scored his first two Bundesliga goals against SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin. He scored 27 Bundesliga goals in two seasons for Borussia before joining Hannover 96, where he spent three years and scored 25 times in 86 league matches. He returned to Mönchengladbach in 1970, with the club having just won the first league title in its history. With Heynckes, who scored 19 times in 33 matches, Gladbach became the first club to retain the Bundesliga title in 1970–71. In the 1971–72 European Cup, Heynckes scored twice in an extraordinary 7–1 win against Italian champions Inter Milan. The match, however, was forced to be replayed after a drinks can had been thrown onto the pitch by a spectator, hitting Inter's Roberto Boninsegna. Borussia drew the replayed home leg 0–0 and were eliminated 4–2 on aggregate. In 1973, after eliminating Dutch club Twente 5–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals, Borussia Mönchengladbach became the first German side to reach the final of the UEFA Cup. Borussia lost the away leg of the final against Liverpool 3–0 at Anfield, after the match initially had to be abandoned after 27 minutes due to a waterlogged pitch. During the match, Heynckes had a penalty kick saved by Ray Clemence, denying his side a decisive away goal. In the return leg, Heynckes scored both goals in Gladbach's 2–0 win. The English team, however, prevailed 3–2 on aggregate to lift the trophy. With 12 goals, Heynckes was joint top scorer of the competition with Twente's Jan Jeuring. Despite disappointment in Europe, Gladbach ended the 1972–73 season with success in the DFB-Pokal final, beating 1. FC Köln at the Rheinstadion in Düsseldorf. In the 1973–74 season, Heynckes was joint top goalscorer in the Bundesliga, alongside Gerd Müller, with 30 goals. His Mönchengladbach side finished second in the table, with Müller's Bayern Munich winning a record third consecutive Bundesliga title. Heynckes was also the top scorer of the 1973–74 European Cup Winners' Cup with eight goals. In this competition, Borussia Mönchengladbach were knocked out in the semi-finals by Milan, losing 2–1 on aggregate.

This victory made Gladbach the first German winners of the UEFA Cup. Again, Heynckes was tournament top scorer, this time with ten goals. Altogether, Heynckes scored 23 goals in 21 games in the UEFA Cup, making him the ninth-highest goalscorer in the history of the competition, and the only member of the top ten to have scored at a ratio of over a goal per game. After regaining the title, Weisweiler left Borussia to become manager of Barcelona. He was replaced by Udo Lattek, under whom Heynckes would later begin his coaching career. Borussia Mönchengladbach went on to win the 1975–76 and 1976–77 Bundesliga titles, matching Bayern's feat of three titles in a row set earlier in the decade. In 1977, Borussia also reached its first European Cup final. In the previous season's competition, Heynckes had been top scorer with six goals. In 1976–77 European Cup, he was less prolific, scoring only one goal in the first round match against Austria Wien.

Despite his excellent form at club level, however, he spent most of the tournament on the bench as Gerd Müller, the national team's all-time top goalscorer, was used as the starting centre forward by coach Helmut Schön. Heynckes was in the starting line-up for West Germany's opening two fixtures against Chile and Australia but then played no further part due to injury and die Nationalelf won their second World Cup, beating the Netherlands 2–1 in the final at Munich's Olympiastadion. In 2013, Heynckes said of his experience at the 1974 World Cup, "I was in the starting lineup for the German national team competing for the World Cup, but after an injury I was sidelined for the entire final. This was the greatest disappointment of my life, but it spurred me on and became my greatest source of motivation." After his playing career, Heynckes stayed with Borussia Mönchengladbach and served the club for eight more years, first as an assistant and then as a manager, succeeding Udo Lattek in this position in 1979 at age 34.

Bayern were in 12th place at the time of his sacking. The team continued to struggle after his departure, eventually finishing five points clear of relegation in tenth place. The decision to sack Heynckes was later described by general manager Uli Hoeneß as "the biggest mistake of my career". Under Heynckes, Bayern reached the semi-finals of the 1988–89 UEFA Cup, the 1989–90 European Cup and the 1990–91 European Cup.

It's where I started as a 19-year-old professional, then worked as a coach. Since then I have come full circle. Mönchengladbach is my home town, I spent 23 years at the club, so this will not be just a normal game for me." The team's fortunes did not improve after Heynckes' departure and the club was relegated at the end of the season, finishing last in the Bundesliga table. Heynckes finished with a record of 5 wins, 4 draws and 12 losses. After over two years out of football, Heynckes came out of retirement and returned to football in April 2009, becoming caretaker manager of his former club Bayern Munich, replacing the sacked Jürgen Klinsmann.

The team's unbeaten record finally came to an end in March 2010 with a 3–2 defeat at 1. FC Nürnberg, after which Leverkusen only won two of their final nine matches and finished in fourth place. In the 2010–11 season, Leverkusen finished runner-up in the Bundesliga to Borussia Dortmund, thus qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2005. It was also the club's highest final league position since the 2001–02 season. They were knocked out in the second round of the DFB-Pokal for the second consecutive season. They also reached the round of 16 in the Europa League. Despite his success, Heynckes decided not to extend his contract and left Bayer Leverkusen in the 2011 close season to take over at Bayern Munich for a third time. On 25 March 2011, it was announced that Heynckes would be replacing Louis van Gaal as the manager of Bayern Munich at the beginning of the 2011–12 season. At the age of 66, he was the oldest coach in the Bundesliga. Heynckes took over a team which had finished third in the 2010–11 Bundesliga, three points behind his Bayer Leverkusen side. He finished with a record of 44 wins, 26 draws and 14 losses at Bayer Leverkusen. Heynckes' first match was a 3–0 win against Eintracht Braunschweig in the first round of the 2011–12 DFB-Pokal. Bayern started the league season with a surprise 1–0 defeat to Heynckes' former club Borussia Mönchengladbach at the Allianz Arena, before six consecutive Bundesliga wins without conceding took them to the top of the table. In all competitions, Bayern kept 12 consecutive clean sheets, including four Champions League matches, the last of which came in a 4–0 win over Hertha BSC. This run of good form ended with a 2–1 defeat to Hannover 96, and losses to Borussia Dortmund and Mainz 05 soon followed, allowing Dortmund, the previous season's champions, to overtake Bayern at the top of the table. Bayern briefly regained top spot in January and February, but after the Bavarians' draw with Hamburger SV on matchday 20, Dortmund again gained first position and went on to retain their title by eight points, ending the season on a 28-match unbeaten run. On 17 March 2012, Heynckes oversaw his 600th Bundesliga match as manager, a 6–0 victory over Hertha BSC. His opposing coach that day, Otto Rehhagel, is the only coach who has managed more Bundesliga matches, with over 800. After finishing the Bundesliga season in second place, Bayern faced champions Dortmund in the 2012 DFB-Pokal final, losing 5–2. Despite their disappointments in domestic competitions, Heynckes' Bayern had qualified for the 2012 Champions League Final in April 2012, defeating Real Madrid on penalty kicks in the semi-finals. In the final, held at the Allianz Arena, die Roten faced English club Chelsea. Despite controlling most of the match and taking a 1–0 lead in the 83rd minute, Bayern lost the match 4–3 on penalties. This meant that Bayern had finished as runners-up in all three major competitions in which they had competed in 2011–12. Bayern started the 2012–13 season by defeating Borussia Dortmund 2–1 in the DFL-Supercup. It was a significant result as the Bavarians had lost all three encounters with die Schwarzgelben in the previous season, and the last five encounters between the clubs overall. Bayern's Bundesliga campaign began with a record-breaking eight consecutive wins before they suffered their only league defeat of the season at Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern quickly regained form and went into the winter break nine points clear at the top of the table. On 16 January 2013, Bayern announced that former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola would replace Heynckes in July 2013. General manager Uli Hoeneß later stated that it was not Heynckes' decision to leave Bayern at the end of the season and was forced by the club's wish to appoint Guardiola. Though the club's press release announcing Bayern's agreement with Guardiola had claimed Heynckes would be retiring on the expiration of his contract, he stated he would not make a decision on his future until the end of the season. After returning from the winter break, Bayern only dropped two points in the entire second half of the Bundesliga season, winning 14 consecutive matches from January onwards and being confirmed as champions on 6 April 2013. This was the earliest a team had ever won the Bundesliga, and Bayern broke several other records during the season including; most points in a season (91), highest league winning points margin (25), most wins in a season (29), longest winning streak in a season (14), most clean sheets in a season (21), best goal difference in a season (+80) and fewest goals conceded in a season (18). The team scored in every match and suffered only one defeat.

On 14 May 2013, he took charge of a Bundesliga match for what he claimed to be the final time. Fittingly, the match was away at Borussia Mönchengladbach, Heynckes' hometown club who he served for over 20 years as a player and coach. In the Champions League, Bayern faced Barcelona at the semi-final stage, thrashing the favourites 7–0 on aggregate to reach a second successive final. The performance was seen as a display of physical and tactical superiority of Bayern over Barcelona. In the 2013 Champions League final, Heynckes' Bayern defeated Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund 2–1 at Wembley Stadium, making him the fourth manager (after Ernst Happel, Ottmar Hitzfeld, and José Mourinho) to win the competition with two clubs. On 1 June 2013, Heynckes took charge of Bayern for the last time in the 2013 DFB-Pokal final against VfB Stuttgart. Bayern won the match 3–2, becoming the first German club to complete the treble of the domestic league, the domestic cup and the European Cup. Former Bayern and West Germany captain Franz Beckenbauer, who led die Roten to three consecutive European Cup wins in the 1970s, called Heynckes' 2012–13 side "the best Bayern team ever", a view shared by the club's legendary forward Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. He finished with a record of 83 wins, 12 draws, and 14 losses. Consequently, he won the FIFA World Coach of the Year 2013 finishing ahead of Jürgen Klopp (second) and Sir Alex Ferguson (third). On 4 June 2013, Heynckes announced he would not coach a team during the 2013–14 season. On 21 June, in an interview with Der Spiegel, Heynckes said, "After everything that's happened over the past two years, I'm ready for some peace and quiet. After this string of successes, I could transfer to just about any club in Europe. I have a problem with the finality of saying 'never'. But I can assure you that I have no intention of coaching again. I had a worthy ending." He was replaced by Pep Guardiola, who had his first training session on 26 June 2013. On 6 October 2017, Heynckes was appointed Bayern Munich manager until the end of the 2017–18 season. Carlo Ancelotti was dismissed and Willy Sagnol managed the team on 1 October against Hertha BSC. Heynckes officially took the role on 9 October. His first match in his fourth stint was a 5–0 win against Freiburg. On 4 April 2018, Heynckes set a new Champions League record of most consecutive wins as a manager with twelve wins by defeating Sevilla in the quarter-final 1st leg match in 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, surpassing the record of ten wins in a row set by Louis van Gaal and Carlo Ancelotti. Bayern president Uli Hoeneß said numerous times in interviews that he wanted Heynckes to stay as manager for the 2018–19 season. Heynckes said in an interview with Sport Bild that he was only going to manage Bayern until the end of the season. Heynckes managed Bayern in 26 Bundesliga matches. He won 22, lost three and one match ended with a draw. In the Champions League, Heynckes was in charge of 10 matches. He won seven, lost one and two matches ended with a draw.
