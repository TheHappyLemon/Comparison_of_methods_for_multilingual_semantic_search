Eventually, it is revealed that she is sabotaging Violet in order to steal her job and permanent spot at 51 for herself, with her going as far as to blackmail Violet's lover Chief Hawkins (with her knowledge of their relationship) into transferring or firing Violet, knowing full well that any attempt by him to protect Violet or retaliate against her could be seen as special treatment by him (which he'd already been reprimanded for by the brass) for Violet, and thus could damage or even end both of their careers. However, when forced to help a pregnant woman deliver in the middle of a fire, Emma panics and abandons the woman, Violet, and other colleagues to save herself, resulting in her immediate termination from 51. It is later revealed in the eleventh-season premiere that Hawkins reported her actions to the CFD's top brass, which seemingly resulted in her firing from the department altogether. However, she resurfaces later in the season, having somehow gotten a job in the CFD's Internal Affairs Division. She initially uses her new position to continue her feud with Violet and the rest of 51, until the former finds and shows Hawkins' recorded entries of her blackmail attempts to her boss, which results in her being fired from the CFD altogether again, this time for good. Pouch the dog (seasons 1–4): Mills is given a dog by a child from a family who could not take care of it. Herrmann, Chief Boden and Mouch initially decide against it, but eventually agree to let her be adopted by the team.

In the fourth season, 51 allows her to be adopted by the son of a CPD detective killed in the line of duty to help him with his grief.

Roman was involved from the beginning having worked with the Chicago Fire Department and Deputy District Chief Steve "Chik" Chikerotis on Backdraft. Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel made an appearance in the series' pilot episode. Emanuel stated: "It's easier being mayor than playing mayor. I told them I'd do it under one condition: the TV show is making an investment to the Firefighters' Widows and Orphans Fund." The title "Chicago Fire" sparked some confusion in the show's first season due to it duplicating the name of a local professional soccer team, the Chicago Fire Soccer Club (later renamed Chicago Fire FC). Actor Taylor Kinney has said "If you (say) 'We're working on Chicago Fire,' they ask you if you're a soccer player." Producer Dick Wolf hoped that fans of the team might watch the show.

Chicago artist and retired firefighter Lee J. Kowalski's oil paintings of fire scenes can be spotted in several episodes. Molly's, a small bar owned by Herrmann, Dawson and Mouch, was filmed at Lotties in Bucktown. Filming no longer takes place on location to avoid disrupting business. Instead, the interior and exterior surroundings were recreated at Cinespace. In November 2012, WGN-TV reported a plane crash at 29th and Martin Luther King Drive on their morning newscast and showed live footage for a few minutes before realizing it was merely a set piece staged for Chicago Fire and not an actual emergency situation.

Production on the series was temporarily halted on September 14, 2022, after a shooting occurred near the set. On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 49 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". On March 27, 2013, NBC announced plans for a proposed spin-off of Chicago Fire, the police procedural drama Chicago P.D. that would involve the Chicago Police Department, the spin-off series being created and produced by Dick Wolf, with Derek Haas, Michael Brandt, and Matt Olmstead serving as executive producers. It premiered on January 8, 2014. The show follows an Intelligence Unit of the police and is filmed entirely in Chicago.
