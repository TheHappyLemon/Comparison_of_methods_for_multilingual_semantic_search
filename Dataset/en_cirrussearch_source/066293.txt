Pulusuk Pulusuk or Houk Island is a village and municipality in the state of Chuuk, Federated States of Micronesia. It is a small island that lies at the end of a 55 km (34 mi) long submerged atoll. Pulusuk is part of the Pattiw group, located 244 km (152 mi) to the west of Chuuk. The first recorded sighting by Europeans was by Spanish naval officer Juan Antonio de Ibargoitia commanding the vessel Filipino in 1799. He charted it as Bartolomé. Houk Airfield consists of a paved 1,350 feet (410 m) runway that cuts through the forested south end of the island.
