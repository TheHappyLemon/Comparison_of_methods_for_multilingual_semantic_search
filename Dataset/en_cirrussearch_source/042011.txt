Spielberg (formerly: Spielberg bei Knittelfeld) is a city located in the Bezirk Murtal in Styria, Austria. The city of Spielberg, with a population of about 5,000 inhabitants, is located north of the Mur in the east of Aichfeld, between the cities of Zeltweg and Knittelfeld. The urban area of Knittelfeld has grown together with part of the urban area of Spielberg. From 1986 to 2009 Spielberg was a Marktgemeinde (market town). On October 1, 2009 it became a “Stadtgemeinde” (city). Within the city limits, there are both urban and rural areas. The city is made up of 9 Katastralgemeinden (cadastral communities). Pausendorf is the biggest Katastralgemeinde, with 1500 inhabitants. The Katastralgemeinde Spielberg is only a small part of the city, but it gives its name to the entire city.

This was triggered when a number of industrial firms moved to the municipality, above all the Austria Antriebstechnik AG (ATB). Spielberg is home to the Red Bull Ring (formerly known as A1-Ring and Österreichring). From 1970 until 1987 and from 1997 until 2003 the Grand Prix of Austria took place there. In 2014, it returned to the Formula 1 calendar. In 2020 the first 2 races of the delayed F1 season took place there: the Austrian GP and the Styrian GP. In 2021, following the postponement of the Turkish GP, a second race, the Styrian GP, was held one week before the Austrian GP.
