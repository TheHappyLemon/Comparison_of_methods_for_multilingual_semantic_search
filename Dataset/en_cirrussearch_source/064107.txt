The Mohamed V Dam is an arch-gravity dam located 35 kilometres (22 mi) south of Zaio on the Moulouya River in Oujda-Angad Province, Morocco. The primary purpose of the dam is supplying water for the irrigation of 70,000 hectares (170,000 acres) downstream. Water is also used for hydroelectric power production and water supply to the city of Nador. The dam is named after Mohammed V of Morocco. The dam's reservoir and wetlands were designated as a Ramsar site in 2005.
