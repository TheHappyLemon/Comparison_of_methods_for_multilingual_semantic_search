Industrial peak of the town was on the 1870s, when 54 factories were working and close trade relations were between Dunaivtsi and Kyiv, Warsaw, Chişinău, Kharkiv, Poltava, Kherson, Łódź, Yarmolyntsi[citation needed]. The town was occupied by the Germans from July 1941 until last days of March 1944. During the occupation, the Germans carried out executions of the Jews. A witness interviewed by Yahad-In Unum described one of these executions, stating, "The Germans gathered 700 Jews of Demyankovtsy. They took them into the mine where the water rose until their knees. Afterwards, the entrance was exploded and Jews were suffocated inside." Dunaivtsi has had city status in its modern form since 1958.
