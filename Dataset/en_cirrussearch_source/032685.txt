After drawing the manga for the doujinshi circle, Imaishi worked as a creator. He worked at Gainax in 1995 as an in-between animator for Neon Genesis Evangelion. Some of his early works include animation direction, storyboarding and key animation for Kare Kano (His and Her Circumstances), FLCL, Diebuster, Oval X Over, and the ending animation of Paradise Kiss.
