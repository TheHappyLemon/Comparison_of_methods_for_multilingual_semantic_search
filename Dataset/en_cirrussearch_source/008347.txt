Year 1125 (MCXXV) was a common year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. June 11 – Battle of Azaz: The Crusader states led by King Baldwin II of Jerusalem defeat the Seljuk forces at Azaz and raise the siege of the town. Baldwin mobilizes a force of 1,100 armoured knights (from Antioch, Edessa and Tripoli) and 2,000 foot-soldiers. The Crusaders capture the Seljuk camp and Baldwin takes enough loot to ransom the prisoners taken by the Seljuk Turks (including his 4-year-old daughter Ioveta and Joscelin II who are taken hostage). Aq-Sunqur al-Bursuqi, governor (atabeg) of Mosul, withdraws to Aleppo and is forced to make a truce, leaving the frontier in northern Syria in peace for 18 months. May 23 – Emperor Henry V dies of cancer in Utrecht after leading an expedition against King Louis VI (the Fat) of France and then against the citizens of Worms. Having no legitimate children, Henry leaves his possessions to his nephew, Frederick II (the One-Eyed), duke of Swabia. At the Hoftag diet in Regensburg, Lothair II (duke of Saxony) is elected King of Germany and crowned at Aachen on September 13. Lothair II (supported by Pope Honorius II) asks Frederick II to restore to the crown the estates that he has inherited from Henry V. Frederick refuses, and by year's end a succession dispute breaks out between the House of Welf and the House of Hohenstaufen. The latter is led by Frederick and his brother Conrad III, duke of Franconia. King Inge the Younger of Sweden is murdered in Vreta Abbey, instigated by Queen Ulvhild Håkansdotter after a 20-year reign. Her cousin Magnus I (the Strong) proclaims himself ruler over the Lands of Sweden (Norrland, Svealand and Gothenland) (until 1134). The Venetians pillage the islands of Rhodes, ravage Samos and Lesbos, and occupy Chios (controlled by the Byzantine Empire). The Florentines sack and conquer the neighboring independent republic of Fiesole in Italy. Saracen pirates raid the city of Antibes in Provence, and the Benedictine monastery of Saint Honorat on the Lérins Islands (French Riviera). The first fair in Portugal is created in Ponte de Lima; it is an early sign of the commercialization and economic development. King Alfonso I (the Battler) of Aragon and Navarre leads a Castellan raid in Andalusia (Southern Spain). King Henry I arranges the marriage between his nephew Stephen of Blois and the 20-year-old Matilda, daughter and heiress of Eustace III, count of Boulogne. This gives Stephen control of the County of Boulogne and also lands in England that has belonged to Eustace (who dies on his return from the Holy Land). November – Jin–Song War: Emperor Taizong of the Jurchen-led Jin Dynasty declares war on the Chinese Song Dynasty – and orders his armies to invade Song territory. He sends the Western army to the city of Taiyuan in Shanxi province and the Eastern army to Bianjing (modern-day Kaifeng), the Song capital. The Song forces are not expecting an invasion and are caught off guard. The Khamag Mongol, a Mongolic tribal confederation, begins to play an important role on the Mongolian Plateau. They occupy the fertile lands of the basins of the rivers Onon, Kherlen and Tuul in the Khentii Mountains.
