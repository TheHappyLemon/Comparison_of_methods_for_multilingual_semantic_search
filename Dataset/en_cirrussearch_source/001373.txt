The Admiralty Mountains (alternatively Admiralty Range) is a large group of high mountains and individually named ranges and ridges in northeastern Victoria Land, Antarctica. This mountain group is bounded by the sea (Ross Sea and Southern Ocean), and by the Dennistoun Glacier, Ebbe Glacier, and Tucker Glacier. The Admiralty Mountains were discovered in January 1841 by Captain James Clark Ross, Royal Navy, who named them for the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty under whose orders he served. The Admiralty Mountains lie to the east of the Concord Mountains and the Victory Mountains, separated from them by the Ebbe Glacier in the north and the Tucker Glacier further south, which flows into the Ross Sea. They are to the south of the Anare Mountains, separated from them by the Anare Pass and the Dennistoun Glacier, which flow east to the Southern Ocean. To their east they are bounded by the Southern Ocean, Robertson Bay, the Adare Peninsula and the Ross Sea. The Dennistoun Glacier which flows past the northeastern section of the Admiralty Mountains, separates then from the Quam Heights and Hedgpeth Heights in the Anare Mountains to the north. The Robinson Heights in the northwest Admiralty Mountains are separated from the Anare Mountains to the north by the Anare Pass. They are east of the Everett Range in the Concord Mountains. The Homerun Range in the Admiralty Mountains is east of the Mirabito Range in the Concord Mountains. Further south, the Admiralty Mountains face the Cartographers Range in the Victory Mountains across the Tucker Glacier. The southern tip of the mountains joins to the Hallett Peninsula to the north of Tucker Inlet on the Ross Sea. Moubray Bay is to the north of the Hallett Peninsula, and receives several glaciers that drain the southeast of the range. The Adare Peninsula extends along the coast to the north of Moubray Bay and encloses Robertson Bay, which receives several glaciers that drain the central part of the mountains. To the north of this bay, glaciers drain the northeast of the mountains directly into the Southern Ocean.

Dennistoun Glacier (71°11′S 168°0′E﻿ / ﻿71.183°S 168.000°E﻿ / -71.183; 168.000﻿ (Dennistoun Glacier)), a glacier, 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) long, draining the northern slopes of Mount Black Prince, Mount Royalist and Mount Adam in the Admiralty Mountains. It flows northwest between the Lyttelton Range and Dunedin Range, turning east on rounding the latter range to enter the sea south of Cape Scott. Ebbe Glacier (71°03′S 164°45′E﻿ / ﻿71.050°S 164.750°E﻿ / -71.050; 164.750﻿ (Ebbe Glacier)), a tributary glacier about 60 nautical miles (110 km; 69 mi) long, draining northwest from the Homerun Range and Robinson Heights, and then west-northwest between Everett Range and Anare Mountains into Lillie Glacier. This feature saddles with Tucker Glacier, the latter draining southeast to the Ross Sea. Tucker Glacier (72°32′S 169°15′E﻿ / ﻿72.533°S 169.250°E﻿ / -72.533; 169.250﻿ (Tucker Glacier)), a major valley glacier of Victoria Land, Antarctica, about 90 nautical miles (170 km; 100 mi) long, flowing southeast between the Admiralty Mountains and the Victory Mountains to the Ross Sea. There is a snow saddle at the glacier's head, just west of Homerun Range, from which the Ebbe Glacier flows northwestward. A number of smaller glaciers drain the east of the mountains to the sea, including (from north to south) Simpson Glacier, Pitkevitch Glacier, Shipley Glacier, Ommanney Glacier, Dugdale Glacier, Murray Glacier, Moubray Glacier, Burnette Glacier and Ironside Glacier.

Robinson Heights (71°22′S 166°40′E﻿ / ﻿71.367°S 166.667°E﻿ / -71.367; 166.667﻿ (Robinson Heights)) are the mainly ice-covered heights 2,170 metres (7,120 ft), elliptical in plan and 15 nautical miles (28 km; 17 mi) long, which rise south of Anare Pass and form the northwest end of the Admiralty Mountains. Findlay Range 71°39′S 167°22′E﻿ / ﻿71.650°S 167.367°E﻿ / -71.650; 167.367﻿ (Findlay Range), a range lying parallel to and west of Lyttelton Range, extending between Grigg Peak and Sorensen Peak.
