Garbiñe Muguruza defeated Venus Williams in the final, 7–5, 6–0 to win the ladies' singles tennis title at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships. It was her second major singles title. She dropped just one set during the tournament, to Angelique Kerber in the fourth round. Serena Williams was the two-time reigning champion, but did not participate due to pregnancy. Venus Williams was the oldest player to reach the final since Martina Navratilova in 1994, and played her 100th Wimbledon singles match in the quarterfinals; it was her first Wimbledon final since 2009 and (by virtue of her run to that year's earlier Australian Open final) marked the first time she reached multiple major finals in a calendar year since 2003. Johanna Konta became the first Briton to reach the semifinals since Virginia Wade in 1978, and Magdaléna Rybáriková became the first Slovak to reach the semifinals. The tournament was the 17th consecutive women's singles major to feature a first-time semifinalist (Rybáriková), dating back to 2013 Wimbledon. Despite losing in the second round, Karolína Plíšková attained the WTA No. 1 singles ranking, after Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep lost in the fourth round and quarterfinals, respectively. This tournament marked the major main draw debuts of future US Open champion Bianca Andreescu and Australian Open champion and world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka. They lost to Kristína Kučová and Carina Witthöft in the first and second rounds, respectively. This was also the first Wimbledon main draw appearance for 2023 champion Markéta Vondroušová; she lost in the first round to Peng Shuai. 01.   Angelique Kerber (fourth round) 02.   Simona Halep (quarterfinals) 03.   Karolína Plíšková (second round) 04.   Elina Svitolina (fourth round) 05.   Caroline Wozniacki (fourth round) 06.   Johanna Konta (semifinals) 07.   Svetlana Kuznetsova (quarterfinals) 08.   Dominika Cibulková (third round) 09.   Agnieszka Radwańska (fourth round) 10.   Venus Williams (final) 11.   Petra Kvitová (second round) 12.   Kristina Mladenovic (second round) 13.   Jeļena Ostapenko (quarterfinals) 14.   Garbiñe Muguruza (champion) 15.   Elena Vesnina (second round) 16.   Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (first round) 17.   Madison Keys (second round) 18.   Anastasija Sevastova (second round) 19.   Timea Bacsinszky (third round) 20.   Daria Gavrilova (first round) 21.   Caroline Garcia (fourth round) 22.   Barbora Strýcová (second round) 23.   Kiki Bertens (first round) 24.   CoCo Vandeweghe (quarterfinals) 25.   Carla Suárez Navarro (second round) 26.   Mirjana Lučić-Baroni (first round) 27.   Ana Konjuh (fourth round) 28.   Lauren Davis (first round) 29.   Daria Kasatkina (second round) 30.   Zhang Shuai (first round) 31.   Roberta Vinci (first round) 32.   Lucie Šafářová (second round) Click on the seed number of a player to go to their draw section.
