Endla Nature Reserve is a nature reserve situated in central Estonia. The Endla nature reserve protects a fresh-water system of mires, bogs, springs and rivulets. As such, it plays an important role in recharging the waters of the Põltsamaa River. The flora is dominated by pine shrubs and reed beds. Several threatened species of orchid can be found in the nature reserve. Rare or threatened birds also use the area as breeding ground. Facilities for visitors include a visitors' centre, towers for bird watching and nature trails.
