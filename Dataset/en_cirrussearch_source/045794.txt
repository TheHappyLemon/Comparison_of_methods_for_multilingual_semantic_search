In 1985, Providence, Rhode Island, 16-year-old high school student Ted Stroehmann is about to go on a prom date with his dream girl, Mary Jensen, when he gets his scrotum stuck in his zipper. He is hospitalized after managing to painfully unzip it, which causes him to miss their date. Ted subsequently loses contact with her. Thirteen years later, in 1998, Ted is a magazine writer and still in love with Mary. On the advice of his best friend, Dom Woganowski, Ted hires private investigator Pat Healy to track her down. Healy discovers that she is an orthopedic surgeon living in Miami with her intellectually disabled brother Warren. After observing her for a few days, Healy also becomes fixated on her. He returns to Providence and lies to Ted about Mary, telling him she is overweight and has four kids by three different men. Healy quits his job and returns to Miami to pursue her. He resorts to lying, manipulation, and stalking to win Mary over. Meanwhile, Ted finds out that Healy was lying about Mary and drives to Florida to see her. During the drive, he picks up a hitchhiker who leaves a dead body in his car. Ted is mistakenly arrested for the murder and bailed out by Dom after the hitchhiker confesses to being the killer. Healy and Mary spend several weeks dating before her British architect friend Tucker exposes his lies. She ends their relationship after Tucker slanders Healy with false stories of being a suspected serial killer. Infuriated over this, Healy confronts him and discovers Tucker actually is an American pizza delivery boy named Norm Phipps who also is infatuated with Mary. Years earlier, Norm intentionally injured himself in order to become her patient and get close to her. He pretends to still be disabled to stay close, and drive away potential suitors. When Ted and Mary begin dating again, Healy and Norm team up to drive Ted away. When Mary reads an anonymous letter revealing that Ted hired Healy to find her, she becomes upset and dumps him. Ted then angrily confronts Healy and Norm, who deny sending the letter, and Ted leaves in frustration. Dom, who is revealed to be Mary's ex-boyfriend "Woogie", later shows up in her apartment and admits to writing the letter. She previously had a restraining order against Dom after he became obsessed with her, which started again when Ted found her despite being married with kids. Norm and Healy, listening outside, intervene and save Mary from Dom. Ted then arrives along with Brett Favre, an ex-boyfriend Mary dumped after Norm lied about him insulting Warren. Ted declares Favre should be with her since he was the only one not to use deception to win her over. After reuniting Favre with her and leaving the other men defeated, Ted leaves in tears, but she chases him down outside and says "I'd be happiest with you" before they kiss.

There's Something About Mary was directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, who had previously made Dumb and Dumber in 1994 and Kingpin in 1996. According to Bobby, the scene where Ted accidentally gets his scrotum stuck in his pants fly was inspired by a real incident, when their sister was listening to some records with some eighth grade students in the basement of their house: "One of the kids went up [to the bathroom] and he zipped himself up. He was in there for a long time. My dad, who was a doctor, actually had to go in and say, 'Hey, kid. You alright?'" Most of the film was shot in Miami, Florida. The Big Pink Restaurant is where Healy meets with Sully, and the Miami-Dade Cultural Center was the location for the architecture exhibit Mary and Healy attend together. The hair gel scene was filmed at the Cardozo Hotel, while Churchill's Pub was used as a strip club for a scene with Healy. The makeup effects were the handiwork of makeup effects designer Tony Gardner. Director Peter Farrelly said in an interview that he had offered Courteney Cox the role of Mary and Cox had accepted, but due to her filming Friends at the time, her agent turned down the offer on her behalf without her knowing.[citation needed] Besides Ben Stiller, actors Owen Wilson and Jon Stewart were considered potential candidates for the role of Ted Stroehmann. Bill Murray was considered for the role of Pat Healy, but the Farrelly brothers thought he was too old for it. Vince Vaughn and Cuba Gooding Jr. were also considered for the role of Pat Healy. Because the Farrelly brothers were fans of the New England Patriots, they originally wanted to cast quarterback Drew Bledsoe as Mary's football-playing boyfriend, but he could not do it due to a mosh incident he had in a club. The Farrelly brothers later offered the role to Steve Young, but he turned it down due to the film's coarse nature. Ultimately, the role was given to Brett Favre. Chris Farley was considered for the role of Mary's brother Warren, however his health was in a rapid decline due to his drug addictions and he was forced to turn down the role. He died in December 1997 in the middle of the film's production. There's Something About Mary was released on VHS and DVD on August 3, 1999. Four years later, a new two-disc Collector's Edition DVD release premiered on July 1, 2003. On May 5, 2009, the film was officially released on Blu-ray. Upon its release, There's Something About Mary ranked in fourth place behind Armageddon, Lethal Weapon 4 and The Mask of Zorro, collecting $13.7 million during its opening weekend, combined with $17.8 million from its first five days. During Labor Day weekend, the film reached the number one spot, making $10.9 million and beating Blade.

It was released in the United Kingdom on September 25, 1998, and topped the country's box office for the next two weekends. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 84% of 85 critics reviews were positive, with an average rating of 7.1/10.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars, stating, "What a blessed relief is laughter.
