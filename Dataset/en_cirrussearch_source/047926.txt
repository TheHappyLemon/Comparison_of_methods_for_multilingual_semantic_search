Representing Kazakhstan at the Summer Olympics, Shvedova retired during her first-round match against Ajla Tomljanović due to heat illness. In August, at the Cincinnati Open, she lost in the first round of qualifying to Zhang Shuai. At the first edition of the Cleveland Open, she was defeated in the first round of qualifying by Linda Fruhvirtová. And again, at the US Open, she was eliminated in the first round by Jasmine Paolini. On October 1, 2021, in a ceremony at the Astana Open, Shvedova announced her retirement from tennis. There was a celebration of her career as well. Shvedova is noted for her powerful serve, groundstrokes, and proficient net play. Her favorite serve is the flat serve down the T, her weakness is her consistency on the forehand side. Shvedova was born to Russian father Vyacheslav and Bashkir mother Nurzia, who used to be a professional runner (winner of the International Association of Ultra Runners 100 km World Championships, 1992). Shvedova has one brother. She began playing tennis at age 8 when her father introduced her to the sport in Chernogolovka (Moscow region). Shvedova changed her nationality from Russian to Kazakhstani in 2008 as part of the country's attempts to boost its sporting profile. Shvedova gave birth to twins in October 2018.

Dubai was classified as a Premier 5 event from 2009 to 2011 before being succeeded by Doha for the 2012–2014 period. In 2015, Dubai regained its Premier 5 status while Doha was demoted to Premier status. The Premier 5 tournaments were reclassified as WTA 1000 tournaments in 2021. In 2014, the Pan Pacific Open was downgraded to a Premier event and replaced by the Wuhan Open. The Premier 5 tournaments were reclassified as WTA 1000 tournaments in 2021.
