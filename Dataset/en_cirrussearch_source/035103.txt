The 2016–17 Ligue 1 season was the 79th season since its establishment. Paris Saint-Germain were the defending champions. The fixtures were announced on 1 June 2016. The season began on 12 August 2016 and ended on 20 May 2017. On 17 May 2017, Monaco secured the title after 37 matches, their first since the 1999–2000 season, the first under the Ligue 1 name and their eighth French title in total. There were 20 clubs in the league, with three promoted teams from Ligue 2 replacing the three teams that were relegated from Ligue 1 following the 2015–16 season. All clubs that secured Ligue 1 status for the season were subject to approval by the DNCG before becoming eligible to participate.

The fifth-placed team received the spot in Europa League third qualifying round originally designated to the fourth-placed team. After being relegated to Ligue 2, Bastia was initially further relegated to National due to financial difficulties. On 10 August 2017, the FFF announced that Bastia was denied entry to National. The club therefore took the place of its reserve team in Championnat National 3. Source: Ligue 1 Legend: Blue = home team win; Yellow = draw; Red = away team win.
