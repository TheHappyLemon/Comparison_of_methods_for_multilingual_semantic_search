Republican Football Club Akhmat (Chechen: футболан клуб Ахмат Соьлжа-ГӀала; Russian: Республиканский футбольный клуб Ахмат Грозный), commonly known as Akhmat Grozny, and formerly as Terek Grozny from 1958 to 2017, is a Russian professional football club based in Grozny that plays in the Russian Premier League. The club was founded in 1946, as Dynamo; it changed its name in 1948 to Neftyanik and in 1958 to Terek. The name was changed again in 2017 to Akhmat. The club is named after Akhmat Kadyrov.[citation needed] In the 1990s the club was disbanded for some time due to the war in Chechnya. From the 1990s to 2007 the club played its home games in the neighbouring resort city of Pyatigorsk, Stavropol Krai. Before the start of the 2008 Premier League season, the Russian Football Union granted Terek the right to host Premier League matches in Grozny.[citation needed] They won the Russian Cup by beating Krylya Sovetov Samara in the final and the Russian First Division in 2004. In 2004 they advanced through the UEFA Cup qualification by beating the Polish team Lech Poznań 1–0 in both legs but lost to Swiss outfit FC Basel in the first round. They played in the Russian Premier League in 2005 but were relegated after finishing last. Terek finished second in the First Division in 2007 and were promoted back into the Premier League.[citation needed] On 3 July 2008, Terek signed three Romanian players at once: Andrei Margaritescu (Dinamo București), Florentin Petre (CSKA Sofia) and Daniel Pancu (Rapid București). Terek finished 12th in the 2010 Russian Premier League season.[citation needed] A new stadium has been built for the club.[citation needed] Cameroonian FC Lotus-Terek Yaoundé, founded by Terek player Guy Stephane Essame and coached by Thomas Libiih, is a farm team of the Russian club. In January 2011 the club signed former Dutch international Ruud Gullit to an 18-month contract to manage the club. On 14 June 2011 Gullit was sacked for poor results. On 7 June 2017, the team was renamed from FC Terek to FC Akhmat, after Akhmad Kadyrov, former President of the Chechen Republic. On 30 October 2017, manager Oleg Kononov resigned, with Mikhail Galaktionov taking over in a caretaker capacity, before being announced as Akhmat's permanent manager on 14 December 2017. On 30 September 2019, after a 2–0 away defeat to Sochi, Rashid Rakhimov resigned as manager, with Igor Shalimov being appointed as Rakhimov's replacement the same day.
