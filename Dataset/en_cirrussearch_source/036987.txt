The president of Zimbabwe Rhodesia was the head of state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia. Like the country itself, it was never internationally recognized. The only president of Zimbabwe Rhodesia was Josiah Zion Gumede. The position was established on 1 June 1979, under the terms of the Internal Settlement negotiated between the government of Rhodesia and moderate African nationalists. It existed until, under the terms of the Lancaster House Agreement, control was turned over to Lord Soames as Governor of Southern Rhodesia on 12 December 1979.
