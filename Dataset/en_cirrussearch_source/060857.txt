Matveev received his degree in computing and networks from the Bauman Moscow State Technical University in 2006. After graduation, Matveev began working at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia as a junior research assistant. He was promoted to engineer in 2009. Matveev was selected as a cosmonaut in 2010. He was appointed to begin training on 12 October 2010, and was named a test cosmonaut on 31 July 2012. The Russian magazine Cosmonautics News reported that Matveev had been selected as a flight engineer for the Soyuz MS-06 spaceflight to the International Space Station; however, he did not launch on this mission, and was replaced by Ivan Vagner. Ultimately, neither Vagner nor Matveev flew on this mission. He was reassigned to Soyuz MS-21, which launched on 18 March 2022. After 194 days, MS-21 landed in Kazakhstan on 29 September 2022.
