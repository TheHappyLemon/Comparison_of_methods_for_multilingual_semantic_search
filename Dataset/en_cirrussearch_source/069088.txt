Expedition 70 is the 70th long-duration expedition to the International Space Station. The expedition began with the departure of Soyuz MS-23 on 27 September 2023 with Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen taking over the ISS command from Expedition 69 cosmonaut Sergey Prokopyev. It will end with the departure of NASA astronaut Loral O'Hara on Soyuz MS-24 on 6 April 2024. Initially, the expedition consisted of Andreas and his three SpaceX Crew-7 crewmates, Jasmin Moghbeli, Satoshi Furukawa and Konstantin Borisov from America, Japan, and Russia respectively, as well as Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub (both on a year long ISS mission) and another American astronaut Loral O'Hara, who launched aboard Soyuz MS-24 on September 15, 2023 and were transferred from Expedition 69 alongside the SpaceX Crew-7 astronauts. However, even after several months of outfitting EVAs and RTOd heat radiator installation, six months later on 9 October 2023, the Nauka RTOd radiator malfunctioned before active use of Nauka (the purpose of RTOd installation is to radiate heat from Nauka experiments). The malfunction, a leak, rendered the RTOd radiator unusable for Nauka. This is the third ISS radiator leak after Soyuz MS-22 and Progress MS-21 radiator leaks. If a spare RTOd is not available, Nauka experiments will have to rely on Nauka's main launch radiator and the module could never be utilized to its full capacity. Later, the crew was replenished by subsequent missions in both expedition and visiting crews, i.e., Axiom Mission 3, (consisting of American Michael López-Alegría, Italian astronaut Walter Villadei, ESA Swedish Project astronaut Marcus Wandt, and Turkish astronaut Alper Gezeravcı), SpaceX Crew-8, (consisting of American Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, Jeanette Epps and Russian Alexander Grebenkin) and Soyuz MS-25, (consisting of Russian Oleg Novitsky, Belarusian Marina Vasilevskaya, and American Tracy Caldwell-Dyson). Originally, the Boeing Starliner Crewed Flight Test was supposed to dock during the expedition. Instead, it was again moved farther down the vehicle schedule to May during Expedition 71.

The Soyuz MS-25 vehicle carried expedition member Tracy Caldwell-Dyson and visitors Oleg Novitsky of Roscosmos and Marina Vasilevskaya, a flight attendant trained by the Belarus Space Agency for ISS EP-21. One week after docking, Novitsky and Vasilevskaya will return with expedition member Loral O'Hara on the Soyuz MS-24 vehicle. Meanwhile, Kononenko and Chub, who launched on MS-24, will return on the MS-25 vehicle. For the first time during 25 March-6 April 2024, all currently active ports of ISS were occupied, that too seven in number. The Prichal aft, forward, starboard, and aft ports all have yet to be used since the module originally docked to the station, and are not included in the table. Graf, Abby (27 September 2023).
