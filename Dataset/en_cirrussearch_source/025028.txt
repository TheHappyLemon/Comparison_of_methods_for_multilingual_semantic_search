Perevalsk was founded in 1889 as Seleznyovsky Quarry, for the workers in coal mining and it belonged to Podolian nobleman and Imperial Russian loyal subject Kazimierz Mscichowski. Over time it grew by incorporating similar miner's settlements. In 1924 it was renamed as imeni Parizhskoi Kommuny (after the Paris Commune) out of brevity was referred to as Parkommuna. In 1938 it adopted its shortened name, Parkommuna, as official, and in 1964 it acquired its present name. In 1964, it became the administrative center of the newly established Perevalsk Raion. Since 2014, Perevalsk has been administered as a part of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).[better source needed] Perevalsk Raion was abolished by the Ukrainian government in 2020. Following the 2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine, Russia has declared the territory as their own, as part of their LPR.[citation needed] Чисельність наявного населення України на 1 січня 2022 [Number of Present Population of Ukraine, as of January 1, 2022] (PDF) (in Ukrainian and English).
