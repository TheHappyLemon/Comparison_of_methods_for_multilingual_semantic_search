Barry is an American black comedy crime drama television series created by Alec Berg and Bill Hader that premiered on HBO on March 25, 2018, and concluded on May 28, 2023, after four seasons and 32 episodes. Hader stars as Barry Berkman, a former U.S. Marine from Cleveland who works as a hitman; upon traveling to Los Angeles to kill a target, he finds himself joining an acting class taught by Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler), where he meets aspiring actress Sally Reed (Sarah Goldberg) and begins to question his path in life as he deals with his criminal associates such as Monroe Fuches (Stephen Root) and NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan). Barry received critical acclaim, with most praise going to its directing, writing, originality, humor, characters, and performances (particularly those of Hader and Winkler). Several critics have labeled it as one of the best television series of all time. The series has received various accolades, including 44 Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Hader won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series twice, while Winkler won Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance in the first season. For the second season, Winkler, Root, and Carrigan all received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor, while Goldberg received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Hader, Winkler, and Carrigan each received two more nominations for the third and fourth seasons. All four seasons of Barry were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. Barry follows Barry Berkman, a U.S. Marine and Afghanistan veteran from Cleveland, who works as a hitman and wrestles with loneliness, depression, and guilt caused by his lifestyle as well as his actions during his service. He travels to Los Angeles to kill a target and finds a new sense of purpose when he follows his target into an acting class. After joining the class and making plans to become an actor, using his newfound passion as an outlet for his anxiety, he struggles to distance himself from his old life and keep his past a secret from new friends and colleagues. Bill Hader as Barry Berkman, a depressed former private first class from the U.S. Marines and Afghanistan veteran who works as a hitman but is drawn towards human connection in an acting class. A mentally unstable yet exceptional assassin, Barry longs to put his criminal history behind him to become a full-time performer under the stage name Barry Block, but struggles to stop his past from creeping into the new life he tries to build for himself. The character's struggle with anxiety in a profession for which he has natural talent was inspired by Hader's tenure as a cast member on Saturday Night Live. Reese Levine portrays Barry as a child in flashbacks (season 4). Stephen Root as Monroe Fuches, Barry's old family friend since Barry's childhood, who groomed him for his post-military career as a hitman. He is cowardly, manipulative, and self-centered, refusing to believe he has been anything but good to Barry despite consistently abusing him and dragging him back into a life of crime to serve his own personal interests. Sarah Goldberg as Sally Reed, an aspiring and talented but struggling actress from Joplin, Missouri. She meets Barry when he joins her acting class and becomes romantically involved with him, culminating in a dysfunctional relationship. Seemingly good-natured but selfish and envious, Sally is focused on gaining fame and fortune as an actress while frequently alternating between bouts of narcissism and self-hatred in both her personal life and creative work. Glenn Fleshler as Goran Pazar (season 1; guest season 3), the leader of the Los Angeles branch of the Chechen mafia, who employs Barry to kill a man who has been sleeping with his wife, and whose gang is in conflict with a Bolivian drug cartel. Despite his ruthlessness as a crime boss, he cares greatly for his teenage daughter. Anthony Carrigan as NoHo Hank, an overly positive and naïve member of the Chechen mafia, and Goran's best friend and right-hand man, who believes being a gangster is his life's calling, though he denies that he would be happier conducting legitimate business. Hank quickly becomes attached to Barry, who does not reciprocate his attempts at friendship. Following Goran's death, he becomes the leader of the Chechen mafia but struggles with this responsibility as he continues to deny that he is not an inherently violent person. Originally planned to be killed by Barry in the pilot episode, Hank was made a series regular after Carrigan's performance impressed the show's creators. Henry Winkler as Gene Cousineau, an eccentric acting coach and Barry's mentor whose glory days as a performer are long behind him, having alienated his industry colleagues and loved ones. Cousineau is self-absorbed and rarely seems to help his acting students, in whom he instills a nearly fanatical devotion, unless it directly benefits him. Despite this, he makes a connection with and serves as a father figure to Barry, helping him come to terms with his past atrocities. Sarah Burns as Detective Mae Dunn (season 3; recurring season 2; guest season 4), a naïve and obtuse investigator who becomes Loach's partner.
