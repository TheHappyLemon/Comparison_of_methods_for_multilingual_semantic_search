José Antonio Chamot (born 17 May 1969) is a retired Argentine footballer and current manager who played as a full-back, mainly on the left flank but occasionally also on the right and, very rarely, as a centre-back. Born in Concepción del Uruguay, Chamot began his career with Rosario Central in his native Argentina, and then moved to Italy, where he played for Pisa (1991–93), Foggia (1993–94) and Lazio (1994–98). His spell at Lazio cemented him as one of the top full-backs in the Serie A; during his last season with the Roman club, he won the 1997–98 Coppa Italia. While playing for Lazio, he deliberately shook referee Pierluigi Collina's hand too firmly post match, and earned a one-game ban for dissent. Chamot then moved to Spain, where he spent one and a half seasons with Atlético Madrid, before returning to Italy (in the January 2000 transfer window) in order to join giants A.C. Milan, for whom he played until 2003, winning the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League and the 2002–03 Coppa Italia. He left Milan during the summer of 2003 (by that time he had lost his place in the starting eleven) and signed for Spanish side Leganés. After an injury-plagued season there, Chamot returned to Argentina to spend the final years of his career (2004–06) with Rosario Central, the club where he had started as a professional footballer; again, however, he was troubled by injuries, and announced his retirement at the end of 2006. Chamot earned 43 caps for Argentina over the course of 9 years (1993–2002), and played in three FIFA World Cups (1994, 1998 and 2002). He was Argentina's starting left-back during both the 1994 and 1998 World Cups, and also played one match in 2002 against Sweden, where he was employed as right-back. He was also part of the Argentina Argentina under-23 squad that won the silver medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, as one of the three overage players (older than 23) allowed for every squad.
