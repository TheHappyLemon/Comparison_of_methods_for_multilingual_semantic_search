The 2006–07 NBA season was the 61st season of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The San Antonio Spurs were crowned the champions after sweeping the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. The first NBA draft under the new CBA rules was conducted, where draftees must be at least a year removed from high school graduation and are at least 19 years old to be eligible. Andrea Bargnani of Italy was selected by the Toronto Raptors as the No. 1 pick, becoming the second foreign player without U.S. collegiate basketball background to be selected No. 1. Portland Trail Blazers guard Brandon Roy was named Rookie of the Year. A new design for the official NBA game ball was revealed on June 28, 2006, at the NBA draft. Amid complaints by players and coaches, the league switched back to the previous ball on January 1, 2007. The 2007 NBA All-Star Game was played on February 18, 2007, at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, the first time the event was held in a non-NBA city. The West defeated the East 153–132, with Kobe Bryant winning the game's MVP award. For the second straight year, the Hornets played a split home schedule between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, due to Hurricane Katrina. The Denver Nuggets and the New York Knicks entered into a brawl near the end of a December 16 match up. All ten players on the court at the time, including Nuggets star Carmelo Anthony (the league's leading scorer at the time), were ejected. Seven players were suspended as a result of the incident, the most notable of which was Carmelo Anthony's 15-game suspension. After 11 seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, All-Star guard Allen Iverson was traded to the Denver Nuggets with rookie Ivan McFarlin for Andre Miller and Joe Smith. After the 2006 Playoff controversy, the format of team seeds changed. Each division winner may be seeded no lower than 4th, but the top non-division-winning playoff team may seed higher than a divisional champ if they have a better win–loss record. Home court advantage is given to the team with the better record, regardless of seeding. The Phoenix Suns and the Dallas Mavericks notched multiple 12+ game win-streaks during the course of the regular season. The Suns rattled off streaks of 15 and 17 games straight (tied for fifth longest in NBA history), while the Mavericks' streaks stretched to 12, 13, and 17 games straight. The San Antonio Spurs joined these two teams by notching a 13-game winning streak. Kobe Bryant notched four consecutive 50+ point games against the Portland Trail Blazers, Minnesota Timberwolves, Memphis Grizzlies and New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets; his streak ranks fourth behind streaks by Wilt Chamberlain. He also changed number from 8 to 24 this season. Jason Kidd and Vince Carter of the New Jersey Nets become only the tenth pair of teammates in NBA history to record triple doubles in the same game. Nearly 20 years had passed since the last tandem, Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, performed this feat. The Toronto Raptors won their first division title in the franchise's twelve-year history. It also marked the first time a Canadian-based NBA team had won a division title. The Golden State Warriors, who had not qualified for the playoffs since 1994, became the first 8 seed to defeat a 1 seed in a best-of-seven playoff series, defeating the 67-win Dallas Mavericks in 6 games. Dirk Nowitzki won the NBA MVP Award and Tony Parker won the NBA Finals MVP Award, the first time either award was won by a European-born player. Long-time Boston Celtics coach and executive Red Auerbach died on October 28 of heart attack at age 89. Reeling with the loss of their patriarch, and being down two key contributors in Paul Pierce and Tony Allen, the Celtics finished the season with the second-worst record in the NBA, at 24–58, which included a franchise record 18–game losing streak. Another Celtics legend, Dennis Johnson, died on February 22, 2007, of the same ailment at age 52. This led to them acquiring both Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen, the following season, to turn their legendary franchise around to a 42–game improvement that followed suit for the next five seasons for the three players. The 2007 NBA Finals, won by the San Antonio Spurs 4–0 over the Cleveland Cavaliers, was the least-watched Finals series in NBA History until the 2020 NBA Finals, with a rating of 6.2. Adidas became the official outfitter of the NBA they remained for the next ten years until Nike became the official outfitter in 2017. Boston Celtics – slightly changed their uniforms added their alternate logo of a cloverleaf above the jersey. Milwaukee Bucks – added new logo and new uniforms, replacing dark green, purple, grey and silver with remained dark green, grey and silver, added red to their color scheme added side panels to their jerseys and shorts.

The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions are marked by an asterisk.
