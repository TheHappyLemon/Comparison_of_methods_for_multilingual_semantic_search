Look up thousand or 1000 in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 1000 or one thousand is the natural number following 999 and preceding 1001. In most English-speaking countries, it can be written with or without a comma or sometimes a period separating the thousands digit: 1,000. A group of one thousand things is sometimes known, from Ancient Greek, as a chiliad. A period of one thousand years may be known as a chiliad or, more often from Latin, as a millennium. The number 1000 is also sometimes described as a short thousand in medieval contexts where it is necessary to distinguish the Germanic concept of 1200 as a long thousand. The decimal representation for one thousand is 1000—a one followed by three zeros, in the general notation; 1 × 103—in engineering notation, which for this number coincides with: 1 × 103 exactly—in scientific normalized exponential notation; 1 E+3 exactly—in scientific E notation. The SI prefix for a thousand units is "kilo-", abbreviated to "k"—for instance, a kilogram or "kg" is a thousand grams. This is sometimes extended to non-SI contexts, such as "ka" (kiloannum) being used as a shorthand for periods of 1000 years. In computer science, however, "kilo-" is used more loosely to mean 2 to the 10th power (1024). In the SI writing style, a non-breaking space can be used as a thousands separator, i.e., to separate the digits of a number at every power of 1000. Multiples of thousands are occasionally represented by replacing their last three zeros with the letter "K" or "k": for instance, writing "$30k" for $30 000 or denoting the Y2K computer bug of the year 2000. A thousand units of currency, especially dollars or pounds, are colloquially called a grand. In the United States, this is sometimes abbreviated with a "G" suffix. 1000 is the 10th icositetragonal number, or 24-gonal number. It is also the 16th generalized 30-gonal number. 1000 is the Wiener index of cycle length 20, also the sum of labeled boxes arranged as a pyramid with base 1 – 20. 1000 is the element of multiplicity in a 24×24{\displaystyle 24\times 24} toroidal board in the n-Queens problem, with respective indicator of 25 and count of 51. 1000 is the number of strict partitions of 50 containing the sum of no subset of the parts. A chiliagon is a 1000-sided polygon, of order 2000 in its regular form. 1000 has a reduced totient value λ(n){\displaystyle \lambda (n)} of 100, and Euler totient φ(n){\displaystyle \varphi (n)} of 400. 11 integers have a totient value of 1000 (1111, 1255, ..., 3750). One thousand is also equal to the sum of Euler's totient summatory function Φ(n){\displaystyle \Phi (n)} over the first 57 integers. In decimal, multiples of one thousand are totient values of four-digit repdigits: 7777 and 9999 have totients of 6000, 5555, and 8888 (as well as 11110) have totients of 4000, 3333, 4444 and 6666 have totients of 2000, 1111 and 2222 have a totient of 1000. Notice, that in the list of composite numbers, 7777 is very nearly the composite index of 8888: 8886 is the 7779th composite number. Also, 5000 has a totient value of 2000, as does 5050 = 2025 + 3025 = 452 + 552, where 3000, 5000 and 7000 are the three multiples of one thousand, less than 104, to not be totient values of four-digit repdigits; 10000 has a totient value of 4000. The totient of 1000 is 400, of 100 it is 40, and of 10 it is 4. 1600 = 402 is the totient value of 4000, as well as 6000, whose collective sum is 10000, where 6000 is the totient of 9999, one less than 104. The sum of the first nine prime numbers up to 23 is 100, with φ(p(23))=1000{\displaystyle \varphi (p(23))=1000}, where p(23)=1255{\displaystyle p(23)=1255} is the number of integer partitions of 23. Using decimal representation as well, 997 is the 168th and largest prime number less than 1000, while 97 is the 25th and largest prime number less than 100; with 9 and 7 respectively the (4th) largest composite and prime less than 10. On the other hand, the largest prime number less than 10000 is the 1229th prime number, 9973. 1000 is also the smallest number in base-ten that generates three primes in the fastest way possible by concatenation with decremented numbers: 1,000,999 1,000,999,998,997 1,000,999,998,997,996,995,994,993 all represent prime numbers.

A connected graph with a given Wiener index represents the sum of the distances between all unordered pairs of vertices in said graph. In the sequence of regular 1000-gonal numbers of the form n×(499n−498){\displaystyle n\times (499n-498)}, the first non-trivial solution is 2997. In Chowla's function, that counts the sum of divisors except for 1{\displaystyle 1} and n{\displaystyle n}, 2997 is the first number to have a value of 1600, which is the Euler totient of 4000 and 6000, while the fifth member in the sequence 9985 (that follows 0, 1, 1000, 2997 and 5992) has an average of divisors that is 2997; with 5992 ÷ 2 = 2996, and 1000 + 2997 + 5992 = 9989 (a difference of 4 from the fourth member, after 1). There are 499 regular star polygrams to the regular chiliagon: 300 are regular compound star forms — a count that represents the twenty-fourth triangular number — with the remaining 199 forms represented by simple regular star polygons. 1600, a repdigit in septenary (44447), is the composite index of 1891, in turn the like-index of 2223. 2222 and 8888 are both numbers n such that n − 1 is prime (as with 4, 44, 444, and 888), yielding respectively the 331st and 1107th prime numbers, where the former (2221) is also the 64th super-prime. These two prime indexes collectively have a range of 777 integers (1107 : 331), which as a number is also a repdigit in senary. The sum (2 + 3 + 5 + ... + 29) of the first 10 prime numbers is 129, which is the 97th indexed composite number. 9973 is also the 201st super-prime, where 1000 − 201 = 799, which is the smallest number in decimal to have a digit sum of 25, and the mirror permutation of digits of 997. When splitting four-digit 9973 into two two-digit numbers, 99 and 73, the latter is the composite index of 99, that, when added together is 172, the one hundred and thirty-second composite, with 132 itself the 99th composite; 73 is the twenty-first prime number. 1601 is the 252nd prime, itself a value with a composite index of 197, where 1601 is the 40th and largest consecutive prime lucky number of Euler of the form n2 + n + 41. The number of 4-digit prime numbers, in decimal, is its mirror permutation of digits 1061, the 172nd prime. Also, 7, 97 and 997 are all three respectively at a difference of 3 from 10, 100 and 1000, where, on the other hand, 9973 is 27 = 33 away from 10000. 8 as a binary number is "1000", and this representation, when written in factorial base, is equivalent to 2410. In primorial base, it is equal to 3010. Wikimedia Commons has media related to 1000 (number). Mathematics portal "chiliad". Merriam-Webster. Archived from the original on 25 March 2022.
