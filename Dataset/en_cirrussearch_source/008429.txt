The 1950 FIBA World Championship, also called the 1st World Basketball Championship – 1950, was the inaugural edition of the World Cup basketball tournament for men's national teams. It was held by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), from 22 October to 3 November 1950. Argentina hosted the competition at Luna Park in Buenos Aires, where ten nations participated in the event. Argentina claimed the gold medal, by beating the United States 64–50 in the decisive game of the final round. After winning the tournament, Argentinian fans celebrated by burning newspapers which became known as the "Night of the Torches". In the aftermath of World War II, Argentina was chosen as host of the inaugural World Cup partly because of its neutrality during the war. FIBA determined the requirements to qualify for the World Championship to be as follows: The top three teams in the previous Olympic tournament (the United States, France and Brazil). The top two teams from the previous South American Championship (Uruguay and Chile). The winner of EuroBasket 1949 (Egypt). The top team in Asia (South Korea). The host country (Argentina). Prior to the Championship, South Korea withdrew due to logistical and financial difficulties in travelling to Argentina, while Uruguay withdrew after Argentinian immigration officials refused the team visas to enter the country. Subsequently, FIBA extended invitations to Ecuador, Yugoslavia, Spain, and Peru. Egypt and Peru advance to the second preliminary phase. Ecuador and Yugoslavia advance to the first repass round. Argentina, Brazil, Egypt and USA advance to the final round. Chile and France advance to the first repass round Peru and Spain advance to the second repass round.
