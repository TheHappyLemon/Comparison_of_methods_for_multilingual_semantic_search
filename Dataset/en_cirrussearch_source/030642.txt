The region is located in the central part of the country. It is one of just three in the country (the others being Prague and the Central Bohemian Region) which does not have a border with a foreign country. The Vysočina Region is home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the most in any region in the Czech Republic.

The region is located in the central part of the Czech Republic, partly in the southeast of the historical region of Bohemia and partly in the southwest of the historical region of Moravia. The entire Vysočina Region is located in the nature region of Bohemian-Moravian Highlands, from whose colloquial name vysočina (meaning "the highlands") the region got its name. Within the country, the region has a relatively high altitude and is the source of many rivers. The most important rivers are the Sázava, Jihlava, Svratka and Oslava.
