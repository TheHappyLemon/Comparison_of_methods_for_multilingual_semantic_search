In the AFC Asian Cup final against Qatar, Yoshida started and captained the side, as they lost 3–1, finishing as runner–up in the process. During the match, he was penalised for handball, leading Qatar to successfully convert the penalty to give the opposition team a 3–1 lead. After the match, Yoshida said: "I felt that the team had a good performance in the (semi-final) match against Iran, and they felt that they were going to be able to go this way and be able to go this way. I couldn't control, and I didn't win. I feel unhappy." However, Yoshida's call-up to the tournament caused squad selection problems for new Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhüttl during his absence. In response, he acknowledged the risk he took by playing for Japan in the Asian Cup. Following the conclusion of the AFC Asian Cup, Yoshida didn't receive an international call–up until August. He was also given the captaincy. Yoshida captained the remaining matches of 2019 with clean sheets. During this run, he scored his first international goal of the year, in a 6–0 win against Mongolia on 10 October 2019. On 14 November 2019, Yoshida also played his 100th match for Japan against Kyrgyzstan. Almost a year later, in October 2020, he was called up to the Samurai Blue squad. He started four matches as captain by the end of the year and helped Japan keep three consecutive clean sheets before losing to Mexico on 17 November 2020. At the beginning of 2021, Yoshida continued to retain his captaincy and helped the Samurai Blue kept another three consecutive clean sheets against South Korea, Mongolia and Myanmar. Yoshida has two brothers: Mirei and Honami He later credited his older brother, Honami, for playing an important role in his football career. Before he was born, his name "Maya" was originally planned for a girl when his mother was pregnant. But the name was kept even if it was a boy who was born. Yoshida revealed on his blog on 26 September 2012 that he was married. Four years later, Yoshida revealed he was a first time father when his wife gave birth to a baby daughter. During his time at Southampton, Yoshida resided in Winchester. After spending seven years at Southampton, Yoshida revealed in an interview with SunSport that he's a permanent resident in the United Kingdom and feels 25 per cent English. His family runs a boarding house in Nagasaki for children who cannot go to high school. Growing up, Yoshida revealed he's a fan of Dragon Ball Z and had an entire collection until his Dad gave it to charity. Yoshida reflected on this, saying it helped him to think generously and give back to society. In November 2007, Yoshida signed for an agency with Tetsuro Kiyooka, a FIFA Players' Agent (Sports agent), in hopes of moving to Europe. It worked when he joined VVV-Venlo, three years later after signing for Tetsuro Kiyooka. Since moving to Europe, Yoshida created his personal blog, where he reflected about his experience living and playing in a different continent. On every anniversary of the Atomic bombings, Yoshida, who is from Nagasaki, spoke out about the thoughts of the event. In May 2018, Yoshida published his first book titled "Unbeatable Mind". In addition to speaking Japanese, Yoshida is fluent in English since he first studied the language in middle school. Yoshida also studied Italian and Spanish. By August 2020, Yoshida began to speak Italian fluently. On 9 August 2013, it was announced that Yoshida would be on the front cover of the Japanese Edition of FIFA 14. During his Japan's career, Yoshida said he considered Atsuto Uchida as fellow competitor, yet his best friend, and is also friends with Eiji Kawashima. Yoshida has an uncle, Tsuyoshi Shimoyanagi, who is a former professional baseball player. He is also a part-owner of Soccer Samurai. In August 2019, Yoshida revealed that he was pledging one percent of his salary to a pledge-based charitable movement, named Saints Foundation. Two months later, Yoshida was named ambassador for the Saints' Foundation along with teammate James Ward-Prowse. In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, Yoshida posted a message on his social media account, urging people to stay at home. While the season was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Yoshida said he exercised daily for three months in order to maintain his fitness. In May 2020, Yoshida used his own money to buy 10,000 masks from Japan and deliver them to hospitals in Genoa.
