Jonas Siegenthaler (born 6 May 1997) is a Swiss professional ice hockey defenceman for the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League (NHL). Siegenthaler made his National League A debut playing with ZSC Lions during the 2013–14 season. He was rated as a top prospect, projected as a possible first round selection in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, and was selected 57th overall by the Washington Capitals. On 30 July 2015, Siegenthaler was signed to a three-year entry-level contract with the Capitals. Siegenthaler remained with the ZSC Lions on loan for the 2015–16 season in order to further develop. In 40 games with the Lions, Siegenthaler contributed 8 points from the blueline before the team suffered a first-round defeat in the postseason. On 16 March 2016, with the Lions season and his loan period at an end, he was reassigned to the Capitals AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears. He also spent the 2016–17 season with the ZSC Lions. After being knocked out with the Lions in the NLA quarterfinals, he returned to the Hershey Bears in mid-March 2017. The Capitals recalled Siegenthaler from Hershey on 8 November 2018, to play against the Columbus Blue Jackets the next night at home in his first NHL game. Veteran Capitals defencemen Brooks Orpik (injured reserve) and John Carlson (day-to-day) were both unavailable to play. Siegenthaler scored his first NHL point on 14 December 2018 in a 6–5 win over the Carolina Hurricanes, gaining the primary assist on a goal by Alexander Ovechkin. During the 2020–21 season, while approaching the NHL trade deadline, Siegenthaler was traded by the Capitals to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for a conditional third-round pick in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft on 11 April 2021. On 9 July 2021, Siegenthaler signed a two-year, $2.25 million contract extension to remain with the Devils. On 26 July 2022, the Devils and Siegenthaler agreed to a five-year, $17 million contract extension. On 6 January 2024, Siegenthaler suffered a broken foot while blocking a shot against the Vancouver Canucks. Siegenthaler was removed from the injured reserve on 20 February. On 11 March, he was elbowed by New York Rangers forward Matt Rempe, causing him to leave the game early. Rempe was suspended four games for the hit. On 13 March, it was announced that he was diagnosed with a concussion and will be out for an extended period of time. Siegenthaler's father is from Switzerland, while his mother is from Thailand. He is the first known NHL player of Thai descent. Siegenthaler competed with Switzerland under-18 team at the IIHF World U18 Championships in 2013, 2014 and 2015. His outstanding play was recognized when he was named to the 2015 U18 WJC All-Star Team. He was also selected to participate at the 2014 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament.[citation needed] He was chosen to skate, as a 17-year-old, with the Swiss junior squad at the 2015 World Junior Championships. Siegenthaler played his last WJC for Switzerland in 2017 where he tallied six points in five games and was Switzerland's most used player with over 25 minutes of ice-time per game.[citation needed] "ZSC talent Jonas Siegenthaler won't move to North America". swisshockeynews.ch. 1 April 2014.
