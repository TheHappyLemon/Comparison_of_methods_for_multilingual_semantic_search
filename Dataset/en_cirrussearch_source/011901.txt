The Mackin Table (84°57′S 64°0′W﻿ / ﻿84.950°S 64.000°W﻿ / -84.950; -64.000﻿ (Mackin Table)) is an ice-topped, wedge-shaped plateau, about 20 nautical miles (37 km; 23 mi) long, standing just north of Patuxent Ice Stream in the Patuxent Range of the Pensacola Mountains, Antarctica. The Mackin Table was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1956–66. It was named for J. Hoover Mackin, professor of geology at the University of Washington, at Seattle. The name was suggested by United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP) geologists who investigated the Pensacola Mountains, several having been students under Mackin.

The Patuxent Ice Stream flows past the south end of the Mackin Table. The east of the table contains the Shurley Ridge, Plankington Bluff, Houk Spur and Mount Dumais. The southern tip contains Mount Tolchin, Lekander Nunatak and Bessinger Nunatak, and is north of Blake Rock. The northern edge of the table holds Mount Weininger, Mount Campleman, Stout Spur, Pierce Peak, the Sullivan Peaks and Mount Wanous. Phillips Nunatak is just north of Sullivan Peaks. 84°54′S 65°23′W﻿ / ﻿84.900°S 65.383°W﻿ / -84.900; -65.383.
