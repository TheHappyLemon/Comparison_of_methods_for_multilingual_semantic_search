Hümaşah Sultan (Ottoman Turkish: هماشاہ سلطان, meaning "phoenix of the Şah"; 1543 – 1582) was an Ottoman princess, the daughter of Şehzade Mehmed and the granddaughter of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and his consort Hürrem Sultan. Hümaşah Sultan was born in Manisa in 1543, where her father Şehzade Mehmed served as sanjakbey. He was the eldest child of Suleiman the Magnificent and his consort Hürrem Sultan. She was her father’s only child. Following her father's death in 1543, shortly after her own birth, she was taken under the care of her grandmother Hürrem Sultan and moved to Constantinople. Like her cousin Ayşe Hümaşah Sultan, daughter of Mihrimah Sultan (younger sister of Hümaşah's father), she was reportedly beloved by their grandfather, Sultan Suleiman, with whom she kept correspondence. Hümaşah, her cousin Ayşe, and her aunt Mihrimah would all imitate the communication style ushered in by her grandmother Hürrem, whose letters to the Sultan are known for their colourfulness, charm, and smoothness. She is regarded by historian Mustafa Çağatay Uluçay as amongst the most influential women of Suleiman's lates years reign. In 1563, she presented her cousin Şehzade Murad (future Sultan Murad III) with a concubine, who would go on to be Safiye Sultan. Hümaşah's first husband was Ferhad Pasha. He had previously served as second Kapıcıbaşı. In 1553, he became the Agha of the Janissaries. In 1557-8, he was made the governor of Kastamonu Sanjak, and in 1564, he was made the third vizier. The marriage took place in 1566 in the Old Palace. The groom, in compliance with the law, walked on foot to the corner of the Old Palace with a scepter in his hand. Their palace was located in the precincts of the Old Palace and Bayezid II Mosque. The two together had five sons and three daughters, including Sultanzade Mehmed Bey, Sultanzade Mustafa Bey, Fatma Sultan and Hatice Sultan. Hümaşah was widowed at Ferhad's death on 6 February 1575. On 25 August 1575, six months after the death of Ferhad Pasha, Hümaşah married Lala Mustafa Pasha. Mustafa was tutor to her uncle, Sultan Selim II. She was his second wife. The two together had one son, Sultanzade Abdülbaki Bey. She died in 1582 , and was buried alongside her father and uncle, Şehzade Cihangir, in Şehzade Mosque. She had a provision made, supported by vakfs, that is, charitable foundations, so that the Quran would be read for the sake of her soul. She had five sons and three daughters by her first marriage with Ferhad Pasha, who included: Sultanzade Mehmed Bey; Sultanzade Mustafa Bey (died 1613, buried beside his father in his mausoleum in Eyüp); Fatma Sultan (died 28 July 1588, buried in the courtyard of Şehzade Mosque), married governor of Shahrizor Eyalet, Mehmed Pasha (died August 1592), son of Mustafa Pasha, and the brother of grand vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha; Hatice Sultan (probably buried inside the mausoleum of Şehzade Mehmed, Şehzade Mosque), propably married Mustafa Bey, sanjak bey of Kastamonu in 1577; She had a son by her second marriage with Lala Mustafa Pasha: Sultanzade Abdülbaki Bey; Necdet Sakaoğlu (2007).
