The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was the 45th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Stockholm, Sweden, following the country's victory at the 1999 contest with the song "Take Me to Your Heaven" by Charlotte Nilsson. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT), the contest was held at the Globe Arena on 13 May 2000. The contest was presented by Swedish television presenters Kattis Ahlström and Anders Lundin. Twenty-four countries took part in the contest. Latvia participated for the first time, while Slovakia, Greece and Hungary decided not to compete, citing financial reasons. Finland, Macedonia, Romania and Switzerland returned after their relegation from the previous edition. Russia also returned, after their last participation in 1997. Meanwhile, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia were relegated due to having the lowest average scores over the previous five editions. The winner was Denmark with the song "Fly on the Wings of Love", performed by the Olsen Brothers and written by the oldest brother Jørgen Olsen. This was Denmark's second victory in the contest, following their win in 1963 almost 4 decades earlier. Russia, Latvia, Estonia and Germany rounded out the top five. Both Russia and Estonia achieved their best result in the contest up to this point, while Latvia achieved the best placing for a debuting country since Poland's second-place finish in 1994. On the day of their victory, Jørgen Olsen was 50 years and 61 days of age, making him the oldest artist yet to win the contest. The combined ages of the Olsen Brothers make them the oldest aged act ever to win the contest. Sponsored by Microsoft, the contest was also broadcast in Australia, Canada, Japan, the United States, and via the Internet for the first time. Stockholm Malmö Gothenburg The 2000 contest took place in Stockholm, Sweden, following the country's victory at the 1999 edition with the song "Take Me to Your Heaven", performed by Charlotte Nilsson. It was the fourth time that Sweden had staged the contest, following the editions held in 1975, 1985 and 1992, held in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, respectively. It was the first time since 1996 that the contest was held on mainland Europe, having in the interim been held in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Israel. Three cities were considered as host city of the contest: Stockholm, which named the Globe Arena as its venue; Gothenburg, which decided to bid with the venue of the 1985 contest, Scandinavium; and Malmö, which bid with the 1992 contest venue, the Isstadion. As on previous occasions, the decision was preceded by an analysis of the possibilities of arranging the event in different places in Sweden, with the organisers eliminating the possibility of hosting the contest in Malmö, due to the proposed venue being outdated and having a comparatively small audience capacity. As Gothenburg and Stockholm progressed in the bidding phase, the selection of the host city was entrusted to television producer Sam Nilsson, who selected Stockholm for the role on 7 July 1999. It was said to be chosen due to the size of the Globe Arena, accommodating a record-breaking audience of 16,000 (although the capacity was reduced to 13,000 for the show), as well as due to Stockholm's last hosting being in 1975. It was also argued that it would be somewhat cheaper than the other options. Per the rules of the contest twenty-four countries were allowed to participate in the event, one more than the twenty-three countries that participated in the 1999 event. Latvia entered the contest for the first time, and Finland, Macedonia, Romania, Russia, and Switzerland returned after being absent from the previous year's event. 1999 participants Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia did not participate in this year's contest. Several of the performing artists had previously competed as lead artists in past editions. Spain's Serafín Zubiri and Sweden's Roger Pontare both competed in the contest for the second time, having previously participated for their countries in 1992 and in 1994 alongside Marie Bergman respectively. The two members of Cypriot duo Voice, Alexandros Panayi and Christina Argyri, had also both participated in Eurovision before, with Panayi having previously represented Cyprus in 1995, while Argyri had been a backing performer at the same contest. A number of former participating artists also returned to perform as backing vocalists for some of the competing entries: Eyjólfur Kristjánsson [is], having previously represented Iceland in 1991 alongside Stefán Hilmarsson, returned to support the Icelandic duo August and Telma as a backing singer; Albano Carrisi, who twice represented Italy with Romina Power in 1976 and 1985, supported Switzerland's Jane Bogaert on stage; and Gabriel Forss, a member of the group Blond that represented Sweden in 1997, was a backing singer for Malta's Claudette Pace in this year's event. Additionally, Eamonn Toal competed for Ireland in this year's contest, having previously served as backing vocalist for Eddie Friel in 1995. Due to the high number of countries wishing to enter the contest, a relegation system was introduced in 1993 in order to reduce the number of countries which could compete in each year's contest. Any relegated countries would be able to return the following year, thus allowing all countries the opportunity to compete in at least one in every two editions. The relegation rules introduced for the 1997 contest were again utilised ahead of the 2000 contest, based on each country's average points total in previous contests. However the rules were modified for 2000 to ensure that the four participating countries which provide the largest financial contribution towards the organisation of the contest would be given an automatic place in the contest every year. This group – comprising France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom – was subsequently dubbed the "Big Four" group of countries. Alongside the previous year's winning country and the Big Four, the remaining places in the 2000 contest were given to any eligible countries which had not competed in the 1999 contest, and the countries which had competed in 1999 that had obtained the highest average points total over the preceding five contests. In cases where the average was identical between two or more countries, the total number of points scored in the most recent contest determined the final order. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia were therefore excluded from participating in the 2000 contest, to make way for the return of Finland, Macedonia, Romania, Russia and Switzerland, and debuting country Latvia. Broadcasters in Greece, Hungary and Slovakia, participating countries from the 1998 contest which had not competed in 1999, and were therefore eligible to participate in 2000, decided not to enter, reportedly due to financial reasons. The calculations used to determine the countries relegated for the 1999 contest are outlined in the table below. Table key   Qualifier  ‡  Automatic qualifier  †  New/returning countries which did not compete in 1999 The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was produced by the Swedish public broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT). Svante Stockselius served as executive producer, Peter Lundin served as producer, Marius Bratten served as director, and Mikael Varhelyi and Kristofer Röhr served as designers. The contest was presented by the journalist Kattis Ahlström and the television presenter Anders Lundin. The graphic design for this year's contest was developed by Stockholm Design Lab and was centred around a stylised mouth logo. It was given the Excellent Swedish Design award later that year. It was described by its designers as "a sensual, yet stylistically pure mouth representing song, dialogue and speech", and was later one of the possible choices for the generic logo introduced at the 2004 contest. The softness of the mouth was contrasted with a pointy typeface, made specifically for the contest. During each performance, a distorted version of each performing country's flag would be shown within the mouth next to the stage. Logo for 2000 contest was presented on 17 February 2000. The draw to the determine the running order of competing countries was held on 21 November 1999. A compilation album featuring all 24 competing entries was released on 13 May 2000, the day of the contest, by EMI Records and CMC International. Each participating broadcaster was represented in the contest by one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country's performance, and all performers must have reached the age of 16 in the year of the contest. Selected entries were not permitted to be released commercially before 1 January 2000, and were then only allowed to be released in the country they represented until after the contest was held. Entries were required to be selected by each country's participating broadcaster by 28 February, and the final submission date for all selected entries to be received by the contest organisers was set for 10 March. This submission was required to include a sound recording of the entry and backing track for use during the contest, a video presentation of the song on stage being performed by the artists, and the text of the song lyrics in its original language and translations in French and English for distribution to the participating broadcasters, their commentators and juries. The results of the 2000 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in 1975: each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country's top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. Each participating country was required to use televoting to determine their points. Viewers had a total of five minutes to register their vote by calling one of twenty-three different telephone numbers to represent the twenty-four competing entries except that which represented their own country, with voting lines opening following the performance of the last competing entry. Once phone lines were opened a video recap containing short clips of each competing entry with the accompanying phone number for voting was shown in order to aid viewers during the voting window. Systems were also put in place to prevent lobby groups from one country voting for their song by travelling to other countries. Countries which were unable to hold a televote due to technological limitations were granted an exception, and their points were determined by an assembled jury of eight individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, comprised additionally of an equal number of men and women, and below and above 30 years of age. Countries using televoting were also required to appoint a back-up jury of the same composition which would be called into action upon technical failure preventing the televote results from being used. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country's performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing; if a tie still remained, the youngest jury member would have the deciding vote. The contest took place on 13 May 2000 at 21:00 (CEST and lasted 3 hours and 2 minutes. The show began with a video montage, comprising various scenes of contemporary Sweden overlayed with the shadow of a human mouth, representing the contest logo, reciting the names of the twenty-four participating countries in English in the order in which they would perform. The montage finished with a night-time aerial shot of the Globe Arena, followed by live transmission from inside the arena, where violinist Caroline Lundgren, dressed in traditional Swedish folk costume, exclaimed "Welcome Europe!" This was followed by a welcome from the presenters of the contest, Kattis Ahlström and Anders Lundin, in various languages of the participating countries. The interval act, "Once Upon a Time Europe Was Covered with Ice", mixed pre-recorded elements from various musicians and people from across Europe with live performances within the Globe Arena, and was composed and edited by Johan Söderberg and produced by John Nordling. The performance within the Globe Arena featured Lundgren on violin, the Strängnäs Drum Corps, street musicians and performers from Stockholm, and the Bounce Streetdance Company [sv]. The winner was Denmark represented by the song "Fly on the Wings of Love", composed and written by Jørgen Olsen and performed by Olsen Brothers. This marked Denmark's second victory in the contest, following its first win in 1963. Belgium meanwhile finished in last place for the eighth time. Prior to the contest Estonia, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands were the favorites to win, with internet polls topped by the last two entries. It therefore came as a surprise to many when Denmark ended up winning, because Denmark was not a pre-contest favorite. Russia finished second and after the contest the Russian delegation petitioned for the disqualification of the winner because a vocoder had been used during the performance. This was not upheld by the EBU. Each country nominated a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for their respective country. As had been the case since the 1994 contest, the spokespersons were connected via satellite and appeared in vision during the broadcast. Spokespersons at the 2000 contest are listed below.  Israel – Yoav Ginai [he]  Netherlands – Marlayne  United Kingdom – Colin Berry  Estonia – Evelin Samuel  France – Marie Myriam  Romania – Andreea Marin  Malta – Valerie Vella  Norway – Marit Åslein [no]  Russia – Zhanna Agalakova  Belgium – Thomas Van Hamme  Cyprus – Loukas Hamatsos  Iceland – Ragnheiður Elín Clausen  Spain – Hugo de Campos  Denmark – Michael Teschl  Germany – Axel Bulthaupt   Switzerland – Astrid von Stockar  Croatia – Marko Rašica  Sweden – Malin Ekander  Macedonia – Sandra Todorovska  Finland – Pia Mäkinen  Latvia – Lauris Reiniks  Turkey – Osman Erkan  Ireland – Derek Mooney  Austria – Dodo Roscic [de] According to the rules of the Eurovision Song Contest 2000, all participating countries should have used televoting, where the top ten most voted for songs were awarded the 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 point(s). In the televoting household shall not be permitted to vote more than three times. In exceptional circumstances where televoting was not possible, a jury was used instead: Russia, Macedonia, Turkey, Netherlands, Romania and Latvia. The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in the order in which they performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country's points in English or French in ascending order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below. The below table summarises how the maximum 12 points were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. Denmark received the maximum score of 12 points from eight of the voting countries, with Latvia and Russia receiving four sets of 12 points each, Germany receiving three sets, Turkey receiving two, and Iceland, Romania and Sweden each receiving one maximum score. Each participating broadcaster was required to relay live and in full the contest via television. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as "passive participants"; any passive countries wishing to participate in the following year's event were also required to provide a live broadcast of the contest or a deferred broadcast within 24 hours. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below. Sponsored by Microsoft, the contest was also broadcast in Canada, Australia, Jordan, Japan, the United States, and via the Internet for the first time, through MSN all 18 European sites and Windows Media channel site. There were some controversies concerning some participating countries. Israel, who opened the contest, entered a group who waved Israeli and Syrian flags advocating peace between the two nations. The two male singers in the group also ran up to each other and kissed for a brief moment. The Russian delegation petitioned for the winning Olsen Brothers to be disqualified, after they had used a vocoder to give Jørgen Olsen an electronic sound to his voice, during one of the verses of their performance. This issue was rejected by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). In the Netherlands, NOS decided to take the contest off air halfway through because of the Enschede fireworks disaster that happened earlier that day, so it could use the channel for continuous news broadcasts. Later, NOS declared that it was both for practical reasons as well as because they found it "inappropriate to broadcast a light entertainment programme on the night of such a catastrophic event". As a result, televoting had to be suspended and the Dutch votes were given by a stand-by jury instead. The contest was later rebroadcast in full on 12 June 2000. The Barbara Dex Award is the award, created by fansite House of Eurovision, was awarded to the performer deemed to have been the "worst dressed" among the participants. The winner in 2000 was Belgium's representative Nathalie Sorce, as determined by the visitors of the website House of Eurovision. On behalf of the German public broadcasting consortium ARD Performed under the Romanian title "Luna" Determined by totalling all points awarded in the past five contests and dividing by the number of times that country had participated. Croatia's score from the 1999 contest was reduced by 33% for the purposes of determining average scores due to the use of synthesised pre-recorded vocals in that year's Croatian entry. Debut appearance. The Dutch votes were provided by a backup jury following interruption to the broadcast of the contest in the Netherlands as a result of the fireworks disaster in the Dutch city of Enschede. Deferred broadcast on 14 May at 01:05 CEST (00:05 UTC) The live broadcast of the contest in the Netherlands was suspended partway through in order to provide emergency news coverage of the Enschede fireworks disaster. The contest was later broadcast in a summary format lasting one hour and fifty minutes on 12 June 2000 at 13:50 CEST (11:50 UTC). Deferred broadcast on 14 May at 20:30 AEST (10:30 UTC) Delayed broadcast on 14 July 2000 at 19:35 JST (10:35 UTC) Deferred broadcast on RTP1 at 23:00 WEST (22:00 UTC) "The end of a decade: Stockholm 2002".
