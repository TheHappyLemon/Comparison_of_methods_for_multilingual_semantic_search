It lies in the Iron Mountains and partly in the eponymous protected landscape area. The area around the Chrudimka River is inhabited since the 12th century. Hlinsko was founded in the 12th century as a guarding settlement on the trade route from Bohemia to Moravia. The first written mention of Hlinsko is from 1349. The fortress in Hlinsko is first documented in 1413. In the 16th century, it served as a royal customhouse. During the reign of Maria Theresa, Hlinsko became a market town, and in 1834, it became a town. During its history, the town's economy consisted mainly of agriculture, pottery, wire-making and weaving. In 1871, the railway was built and the town was industrialized. There is a major dairy company Mlékárna Hlinsko in the town. The company was founded in 1939, and the production started in 1943. Hlinsko is the terminus of two railway lines, heading from Pardubice and from Havlíčkův Brod. Hlinsko and several municipalities in the surrounding area are known for Slavic carnival processions of masks. In 2010, this tradition known as "Shrovetide door-to-door processions and masks in the villages of the Hlinecko area" was included on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. Hlinsko is known for the Betlém Village Monument Reservation with preserved examples of folk architecture. This area around the Chrudimka River consists of valuable timbered and brick houses from the 18th and early 19th centuries. It is part of the Vysočina Open Air Museum. The historic centre is formed by Poděbradovo Square. The most valuable building are the town hall, Ježdík's House and the old fortress.
