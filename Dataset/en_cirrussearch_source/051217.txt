It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the animation, screenplay, music, visuals, and emotional weight. The film grossed US$193.8 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing Japanese film of 2019 and the seventh highest-grossing anime film of all time, unadjusted for inflation. The film won a number of awards, including being selected as the Japanese entry for Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards. It received four Annie Award nominations, including for Best Independent Animated Feature, tying Spirited Away, Millennium Actress, (both 2001) and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2005) for the second-joint most nominations for an anime film at the Annies, behind Ghost in the Shell (1995) and then Belle (2021) with five. In June 2021, first year high schooler Hodaka Morishima escapes to Tokyo in order to get away from his troubled home life in Kōzu-shima. When his ferry to the city is hit by a torrential rainstorm, he almost slides off the boat, but Keisuke Suga, saves his life. As Hodaka begins to struggle financially due to a lack of job opportunities, he later finds a Makarov PM handgun lthat was abandoned in a trash can but, he keeps it even though guns are illegal. He meets Hina Amano, an employee of a McDonald's restaurant, who takes pity on him and gives him free food. Suga hires him as his assistant at a small occult magazine publishing company where they investigate urban legends related to the unusually rainy weather in Tokyo. They hear the legend of "sunshine girls" who can stop rain, and bring sunshine. Hodaka sees Hina being intimidated into working at a club. He attempts to intervene, but is attacked by the club owner. He draws the gun, and out of panic, fires it, barely missing him. Later, he throws the gun away after realizing his mistake. Hina then grabs him and takes him to Yoyogi Kaikan, an abandoned building with a shrine on the roof, Hina shocks him by demonstrating her ability to clear the sky by praying. He later discovers that Hina lives alone with her brother Nagi, and they have no adult guardian. Seeing how they are also in financial trouble, Hodaka proposes to start a business together: a job to clear the weather for large social gatherings, such as weddings and parties. Their business becomes a success, however, Hina was filmed and broadcast on television after being hired to clear the sky for a fireworks display, leading to their site getting flooded with requests. They decide to temporarily suspend business to give them some time to rest. Meanwhile, the police are searching for Hodaka, as his family had filed a missing person report. They later trace Hodaka using a security camera, where he was captured using the gun. Officers arrive at Hina's apartment and interrogate her; Hina realizes that because they have no legal guardians, social services are going to separate her and Nagi. Suga, having also been visited by the police, fires Hodaka, explaining that police suspect him of kidnapping him. Hodaka, Hina, and Nagi try to run away but are halted by the weather, which is worsening, subsequently causing delays on public transport. Two police officers find them walking in the street, and tackle Hodaka to the ground, however, he is set free by Hina, who unintentionally uses her powers to send a bolt of lightning to a nearby truck, causing it to explode, distracting the officers. They eventually take shelter in a hotel. Hina reveals that her body is slowly turning transparent the more she uses her power, and reveals that her sacrifice will allow the weather to return to normal. The next day, Hina has vanished and the rain has stopped. The police track Hodaka to the hotel and take him into custody. Nagi is sent to the children's counseling center. Hodaka, realizing that he has fallen in love with Hina, wants to bring her back, and escapes from custody with the help of Suga's niece Natsumi. The police surround Hodaka in the abandoned building, but Suga, inspired by Hodaka's desperation to see Hina, helps him escape. At the rooftop shrine, Hodaka jumps through the shrine gate and is transported into the sky, where he finds Hina and asks her to leave with him, insisting that Hina let go of her worries about the weather and start living for herself. As soon as they come back to the rooftop shrine, Hina, Hodaka, Natsumi, Nagi, and Suga are all arrested, and the heavy rains resume. Hodaka is sentenced to a three-year probation and sent back to his home in Kōzu-shima. Three years later, the rain has been falling without end in Tokyo, submerging much of the city. In the spring of 2024, having finished his probation, Hodaka graduates from high school and returns to Tokyo to start college. He meets with Suga, who has expanded his business. After Suga encourages him to find Hina, Hodaka finds her praying on a street overlooking the drowned city. They reunite, with Hodaka promising her that they will be all right.

On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on reviews from 30 critic reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Brian Ashcraft of Kotaku praised the film, saying; "in Weathering with You, the connection to real-world weather seems muted and like a missed opportunity. Weather in Japan has long been predictable. But in the past few years, Japanese weather, like weather all over the world, has gotten increasingly strange, relentless and dangerous. In the movie, it's mentioned how the weather has been changing, but it's in relation to how spring and summer have become less enjoyable for kids in Japan. There's nothing about how dangerous this weather has become. And even with the movie shows the power of weather, the impact is underplayed. but later wrote "the biggest problem that Weathering with You has is this: it's the follow up to Your Name". Daryl Harding, writing for Crunchyroll News, praised the world-building aspect of the film, stating that Shinkai has his finger on the pulse of modern Tokyo's atmosphere, but criticized the similarity between Weathering with You and Your Name. Kim Morrissy of Anime News Network also gave the film a generally positive review, praising its visuals and use of weather to convey the story's metaphor, but criticizing the execution in the second half of the film; she wrote that "Shinkai was evidently constrained by the need to fit his story into a particular template, one that didn't seem to fit the plot this time around". Twwk, reviewing the film for Beneath the Tangles, was mostly positive as well, writing; "The movie isn't as emotionally powerful as Your Name due to a screenplay that plays too loose (and lazy) to earn its huge moments, but it's still heartfelt." James Marsh from South China Morning Post praised the film for its animation, but criticized it for its lack of "clarity of vision seen in Your Name". He described the plot as more straightforward than that of Your Name, but said it has some unanswered and "dangling" plot threads. A review by Alicia Haddick for Otaquest praised the film's attempts to differentiate itself from Makoto Shinkai's past work and praised its animation, story and music, but said that its reliance on the structure of his last film hurt the movie overall, stating that "it's impossible to discuss this film without the specter of Your Name hanging over your shoulder". Andrew Paredes, writing for ABS-CBN News, praised the film's characters, story, themes, and Makoto Shinkai's directing, saying; "The effusive emotion and Shinto mysticism rubbing up nicely against real-world concerns. And then there's the animation: Shinkai has outdone himself with this follow-up, presenting Tokyo not just with detailed fidelity, but also with a glow that suggests a lush, lambert [sic] inner life." Terence Toh, writing for The Star, praised the film's characters and story, saying; "Weathering With You boasts of wonderful visual and likeable characters. The story is also right as rain." The film was selected Japan's entry for Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards, but it failed to make the shortlist. It also received four Annie Award nominations including Best Independent Animated Feature, which makes it the fourth anime film tying with Spirited Away, Millennium Actress, and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence to have four nominations; the second-joint highest for an anime film at the Annies, behind Ghost in the Shell (1995) and then Belle (2021) with five.
