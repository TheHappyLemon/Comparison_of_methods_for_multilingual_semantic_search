Georgy Mikhailovich Vitsin (Russian: Георгий Михайлович Вицин; 18 April 1917 – 22 October 2001) was a Soviet and Russian stage and film actor. People's Artist of the USSR (1990). Vitsin was born in Terijoki, former Finland, now Zelenogorsk, Saint Petersburg in 1917 (Soviet documents list him as having been born in Petrograd — now Saint Petersburg). He enjoyed a long acting career and continued performing until close to the end of his life. Apart from playing with Yuri Nikulin and Yevgeny Morgunov, he appeared in dozens of films that earned him the adoration of millions. Modest and sympathetic characters played by Vitsin evoked kindly feelings of viewers. At the same time the actor played in detective, historical and lyrical feature films. His first film roles date to the 1940s. He gained nationwide popularity in the former Soviet Union with the emergence of a series of 1960s comedies by director Leonid Gaidai. He played the role of the Coward among a trio of colorful, scheming characters in such Gaidai movies as Bootleggers (1962), Operation Y and Shurik's Other Adventures (1965), and Kidnapping, Caucasian Style (1967). The last two subsequently beat the Soviet all-time record of ticket sales. The trio of actors, including the late Yuri Nikulin and Yevgeny Morgunov, was "the most popular ensemble in the history of the national cinema." In 1990, he was awarded the top artistic title of the Soviet era, that of People's Artist of the USSR. In spite of the plenty of his characters Vitsin's talent deserved something greater and he never played the major role of his life. “Vitsin is awfully gifted and both of us together are not worth his finger”, his partners Nikulin and Morgunov said about him. According to film director Nikita Mikhalkov, Vitsin "was one of those rare people and actors whom upon meeting, you immediately feel as if they must know just as much about you as you know about them." According to Mikhalkov, Vitsin was also rare in that his popularity did not affect his personality. He was modest to the point that even in the years leading up to his death, when his financial circumstances were abysmal, he never asked for help. Russian media reported that Vitsin had declined into alcoholism and vagrancy but these reports were false. During the last seven years of his life Georgy Vitsin did not act in films and appeared only in comic concerts of the Theatre of Film Actor. He died on 22 October 2001 at 4:30 p.m. He was buried at Vagankovo Cemetery, Moscow. A monument to Georgy Vitsin was established in Zelenogorsk in 2008 marking the town's 460th jubilee and the 90th anniversary since the actor's birthday. 1937: Bespridannitsa 1944: Ivan the Terrible — oprichnik 1945: Hello Moscow! — railwayman 1946: The Great Glinka — spectator 1952: Composer Glinka — Nikolai Gogol 1953: Belinsky — Nikolai Gogol 1954: The Boys from Leningrad — Vasia Vesnushkin 1955: Twelfth Night — sir Andrew 1956: Maxim Perepelitsa — grandpa Musiy 1956: The Mexican — Billy Carthey 1956: Murder on Dante Street — Pitu 1957: Poet — (uncredited) 1957: Don Quixote — Sanson Carrasco 1957: She Loves You — Kostya Kanareykin 1957: Wrestler and a clown — Enrico 1958: New attraction — Semion Iljich 1958: A Groom from the Other World — Pyotr Petrovich Fikusov 1958: A Girl with a Guitar 1959: Ottsy i deti — Sitnikov 1959: I Was a Satellite of the Sun — Uchyonyy 1959: Vasily Surikov — Ilya Repin 1959: Kak possorilis Ivan Ivanovich s Ivanom Nikiforovichem — Gogol 1960: Tri rasskaza Chekhova — Degtyaryov (segment "A Vengeance") 1961: Dog Barbos and Unusual Cross (Short) — Coward 1961: End of old Beryozovka — Geometry teacher 1961: Bootleggers — Coward (segment "Pyos Barbos i neobychainy kross") 1962: Artist from Kokhanivka — Grandfather Kuzma 1962: The Way to the pier — intellectual in the sobering-up station 1962: Colleagues 1963: Molchat tolko statui — Jacques Meslier 1963: Strictly Business — avantyurist Sam (segment "The Ransom of Red Chief") 1963: Kain XVIII — Freelance Hangman 1963: The first trolleybus — drunk man 1963: Blind Bird — train passenger 1963: Short stories 1964: A Tale of Lost Times — evil wizard Andrew 1964: Spring chores — uncle Pudya 1965: Balzaminov's Marriage — Misha Balzaminov 1965: Give Me a Book of Complaints — Zaveduyushchiy otdelom 1965: Zaychik — assistant director 1965: Operation Y and Other Adventures of Shurik — The Coward (segment "Operatsiya Y") 1965: Road to the sea 1966: Byvayet i tak 1966: Udivitelnaya istoriya, pokhozhaya na skazki 1966: Podi tuda, ne znayu kuda — Narrator 1966: Who invented the wheel? — Uncle 1966: The Formula of the Rainbow — Director of the toy factory 1966: Kidnapping, Caucasian Style — Coward 1967: Seven Old Men and One Girl — Coward 1968: Tatyanin den — Man Offering New Chronology 1968: Save the drowning — Militia Precinct Chief 1968: An Old, Old Tale — Dobryy Bolshebnik 1969: The Diamond Arm — Drunk Man 1969: Golfstrim — Igor's Father 1969: In the thirteenth hour of the night — Ovinny 1969: Kabacjok "13 chairs" (TV Series) — pan Cypa 1970: Step off the roof — englishman 1970: Guardian — Tebenkov 1970: As we were looking Tishka — Petty Officer Stepanov 1971: Kak my iskali Tishku 1971: The Twelve Chairs — fitter Mechnikov 1971: The Shadow — doctor 1971: Gentlemen of Fortune — Gavrila Sheremetev (Sad Sack) 1971: Spring tale (TV Movie) — Tsar Berendey 1972: The mortal enemy — Yegor 1972: Tobacco Captain (TV Movie) — cook 1973: Incorrigible Liar — Alexei Ivanovich Tyutyurin 1973: The Sannikov Land — Ignaty 1973: Chipollino — lawer Vetch 1973: Have you ever loved? 1974: Tsarevich Prosha — «King Katorz IX» 1974: North Rhapsody — seller 1974: Honey boy — Macintosh 1974: My destiny (Short) — drunk man 1975: Car, Violin and the Dog Klyaksa — Banjo / Guitar 1975: The big attraction — Gankin 1975: It Can't Be! — Papanya nevesty 1975: Finist, the brave Falcon — Agafon 1975: Puzyrki 1975: Shag navstrechu — people at the buffet 1976: The Blue Bird — Sugar 1976: Shag navstrechu — Man 1976: Au-u! — Learning 1976: Shepherd Yanka — Prince Kukimor 1976: Merry dreams or Laughter and Tears (TV Movie) — Krivello 1977: Twelve Chairs (TV Mini-Series) — Bezenchuk 1977: The sun, the sun again 1977: Until the clock strikes — Grandfather / The Great Gardener 1977: Marinka, Yanka and the secrets of the royal castle — Prince Kukimor 1978: Istoriya s metranpazhem — Semyon Kaloshin 1980: Borrowing Matchsticks — Tahvo Kenonen, tailor 1980: Comedy of bygone days — Coward 1981: Ruki vverkh! 1982: Love by Request — Hapless Boyfriend-artist (voice, uncredited) 1982: Sorcerers (TV Movie) — cat (voice) 1983: The Pokrovsky Gate — Savelich (voice) 1985: Rivals — old man 1985: Dangerous for Your Life! — Alexander Chokolov 1986: Travel Pan Klyaksa 1986: I counselor outpost 1992: Shot in a coffin — Colonel Zakusnyak 1992: Gospoda Artisty — Nil Palych 1993: Brave guys — Maj.
