Guatemala first participated at the Olympic Games in 1952, but then missed the next three Olympiads. Guatemala has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since 1968. The nation has participated in the Winter Olympic Games once, in 1988. Guatemala won its first Olympic medal sixty years after its first Olympic appearance, during the 2012 Summer Olympics, when Érick Barrondo took second place in the men's 20 km walk. This makes Guatemala notable as one of the few countries with more Nobel laureates than Olympic medalists. The National Olympic Committee (NOC) for Guatemala was created in 1947 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that same year. In mid-2023, Guatemala was suspended by the IOC due to a 'domestic legal dispute', meaning its athletes would not be invited to compete under their own flag for the 2024 Summer Olympics. On March 19, 2024, the IOC EB provisionally lifted the suspension of Guatemala's NOC.   Host country Category:Olympic competitors for Guatemala List of flag bearers for Guatemala at the Olympics Tropical nations at the Winter Olympics Guatemala at the Paralympics "Chen wins Olympic 20km walk, history for Guatemala".
