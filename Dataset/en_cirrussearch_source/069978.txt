Medovik (Russian: медови́к (medovik), from мёд/мед — 'honey') is a layer cake popular in countries of the former Soviet Union. The identifying ingredients are honey and smetana (sour cream) or condensed milk. It is a dessert which is known for its lengthy preparation time. It consists of layers of sponge cake with a cream filling and is often covered with nuts or crumbs made from leftover cake. While the thin layers harden shortly after coming out of the oven, the moisture of the filling softens it again over time. There are many recipes and variations of this cake, but, the main ingredient is honey, giving it the characteristic taste and flavor. According to Russian tradition, the cake was created in the 19th century in the Russian Empire by a young chef who sought to impress Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna, wife of Alexander I. Empress Elizabeth could not stand honey, and any dish made with it drove her mad. One day, however, a young new confectioner in the Imperial kitchen did not know the empress's dislike, and he baked a new cake with honey and thick sour cream. Surprisingly, and unaware of the honey content, Empress Elizabeth immediately fell in love with it. Despite this legend, medovik is not mentioned in any of the 19th-century Russian cookbooks. The first recipe for medovik is found in the 1957 and 1960 book "Ukrainian Dishes" published in Ukrainian in Kyiv. Medovik gained its intense popularity during the Soviet era. Today, there are numerous variations of medovik: with condensed milk, buttercream or custard. Desserts similar to medovik are also popular in other Eastern and Central European countries. There is the Czech medovnik, Lithuanian medutis and the Polish miodownik. In Bulgaria, medovik is mostly known under the name "French village cake". Ukrainian medivnyk is cooked without the cream.
