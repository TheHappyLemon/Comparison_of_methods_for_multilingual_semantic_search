India Tower (previously known as the Park Hyatt Tower; also known as the Dynamix Balwas Tower or DB Tower) is an uncompleted 126-story, 707.5 m (2,321 ft) megatall skyscraper that began construction in the city of Mumbai, India, in 2010. The tower was originally planned for completion in 2016, but construction work was put on hold in 2011 due to a dispute between the tower's developers and Mumbai's civic authorities. As of 2023, there are no updates on the construction of the building. The Dynamix Balwas realtor Group first proposed the project, under the name of Park Hyatt Tower, in 2008. The Dynamix Balwas proposal would have been an 85-story tower with a height of 301.1 metres (988 ft). The project was subsequently dropped, before being revived and amended in 2010 as a much taller building. In January 2010, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation authorised the tower's construction on a site located at Charni Road in Girgaon, southern Mumbai, just north of Mumbai's historical CBD (Central Business District). Site preparation work commenced in late 2010. However, in May 2011 Mumbai's civic building proposals department issued a stop-work order due to a payment dispute with the developers, halting the tower's construction indefinitely. The tower was cancelled on 16 October 2015.[citation needed] Legacy Tower Suzhou Zhongnan Center Goldin Finance 117 Wuhan Greenland Center World One Baoneng Shenyang Global Financial Center Azerbaijan Tower India Towers in South Mumbai "CTBUH Tall Buildings Database".
