Jasper Stuyven (born 17 April 1992) is a Belgian professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Lidl–Trek. He is considered to be a classics specialist, and has won several major races including the 2021 Milan–San Remo, one of cycling's monuments, the 2020 Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and the 2016 Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne. He has also had success in stage races, winning the overall classification of the 2019 Deutschland Tour as well as a stage of the 2015 Vuelta a España. Stuyven has also competed in six editions of the Tour de France, finishing on the podium several times on different stages. Born in Leuven, Stuyven had a successful career as a junior rider. In 2009, at age 17, he won the UCI Junior World Road Race Championships. 2010 brought Stuyven more successes when he won one day races Paris-Roubaix Juniors and Remouchamps–Ferrières–Remouchamps. He began his professional career at age 20 for Bontrager–Livestrong; he earned four victories with the team, including the Volta ao Alentejo. Stuyven joined UCI WorldTeam Trek Factory Racing in 2014 at the age of 22. During this season, he rode in his first grand tour, the Vuelta a España. In this race, he earned fourth place in three stages and finished ninth in the points classification. 2015 brought Stuyven his biggest victory yet, when he won stage 8 of the Vuelta a España in a reduced bunch sprint. Stuyven had been involved in a crash earlier in the stage and he was forced to withdraw from the race after the stage with a broken scaphoid. In 2016, he won the Belgian one-day race Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne by breaking away solo for the last 17 kilometres (11 miles) of the race. Stuyven also earned a fifth place at the E3 Harelbeke. He was named in the start list for the Tour de France where he held the polka-dot jersey as leader of the mountains classification for two days. Stuyven was part of the 5 man leading group at Paris–Roubaix, and finished fourth in the sprint finish behind Greg Van Avermaet of BMC Racing Team. He rode in the Giro d'Italia. In stage six, Stuyven finished second behind Silvan Dillier of BMC Racing Team after the pair had been part of a five-man breakaway that rode clear of the peloton for almost all of the 217-kilometre (135-mile) stage. Stuyven finished the race in 98th place overall, and was second in the points classification behind Fernando Gaviria of Quick-Step Floors. In 2018, Stuyven finished in the top 10 in many of the spring classics, including 4th place in Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, and 5th in Paris–Roubaix, being part of the chase group with Sep Vanmarcke and defending champion Greg Van Avermaet. In the Tour de France, he came close to winning stage 14 but was overtaken on the last climb by eventual stage winner Omar Fraile with less than 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) to go; for his efforts, however, he walked away with the day's combativity award. In September, he first won the Grand Prix de Wallonie, before winning his home town race in Leuven, the Grote Prijs Jef Scherens. In late August, Stuyven won the Deutschland Tour after taking the overall lead on stage 3. He carried his good form into the autumn classics with several top ten results, including two podium finishes at the Grand Prix de Wallonie and the Tour de l'Eurométropole. Before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the 2020 road cycling season, Stuyven got off to a strong start. In the opening weekend of the Belgian road cycling season, he won Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, beating fellow Belgian Yves Lampaert in a two-up sprint, before finishing fifth in Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne the day after. Once racing resumed, he bookended August with a pair of fifth-place finishes in the Circuito de Getxo on 2 August and then in the UEC European Road Championships road race on 26 August. On 20 March, Stuyven won Milan-San Remo for his first Monument victory. With three kilometers left, he attacked at the bottom of the descent of the Poggio, the last climb in the race. Many of the main pre-race favorites in the lead group were hesitant to chase him down, though Søren Kragh Andersen managed to bridge across to Stuyven in the final kilometer. With the group closing down the duo, Stuyven launched out of Kragh Andersen's slipstream in the last 200 meters. Though he was on his limit, he held on for the win on the line just ahead of the chasing group, led home by Caleb Ewan ahead of defending champion Wout van Aert. Stuyven studied at the Sint-Pieterscollege in Leuven. Outside of cycling, he and his uncle Ivan, an experienced chocolatier, run a small chocolate boutique in Betekom named Chocolade Atelier Stuyven that opened in 2016 and often produces many cycling-themed pieces. 2009 1st Road race, UCI World Junior Championships 2nd Overall Giro della Toscana 3rd Overall Driedaagse van Axel 4th Overall Keizer der Juniores 2010 1st Paris–Roubaix Juniors 1st Remouchamps–Ferrières–Remouchamps 1st Stage 4 3 Giorni Orobica 3rd Road race, UCI World Junior Championships 4th Overall Driedaagse van Axel 1st Stage 3 2011 2nd Paris–Roubaix Espoirs 2012 1st Stage 3 Cascade Classic 7th Grand Prix de Wallonie 2013 1st Overall Volta ao Alentejo 1st Points classification 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 2 1st Stage 1 Tour de Beauce 3rd Grote Prijs Jef Scherens 3rd Liège–Bastogne–Liège Espoirs 2015 (1 pro win) 1st Stage 8 Vuelta a España 2016 (1) 1st Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 5th E3 Harelbeke 9th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad Tour de France Held after Stages 2–4 Combativity award Stage 2 2017 (1) 2nd Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 3rd Road race, National Championships 3rd Overall BinckBank Tour 1st Stage 7 4th Paris–Roubaix 5th Brussels Cycling Classic 6th Japan Cup 7th Eschborn-Frankfurt – Rund um den Finanzplatz 7th EuroEyes Cyclassics 8th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2018 (3) 1st Grand Prix de Wallonie 1st Grote Prijs Jef Scherens 2nd Brussels Cycling Classic 3rd Road race, National Championships 3rd Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec 3rd Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen 4th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 5th Paris–Roubaix 6th E3 Harelbeke 7th Tour of Flanders 9th Gent–Wevelgem 9th Halle–Ingooigem 10th Overall BinckBank Tour 1st Stage 4 10th Milan–San Remo 10th Dwars door Vlaanderen 10th Tour de l'Eurométropole Combativity award Stage 14 Tour de France 2019 (1) 1st Overall Deutschland Tour 2nd Grand Prix de Wallonie 3rd Tour de l'Eurométropole 4th London–Surrey Classic 5th Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec 5th Brussels Cycling Classic 6th Binche–Chimay–Binche 6th Grand Prix de Fourmies 2020 (1) 1st Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 5th Road race, UEC European Championships 5th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 5th Circuito de Getxo 2021 (1) 1st Milan–San Remo 3rd Paris–Tours 3rd Primus Classic 4th Road race, UCI World Championships 4th Tour of Flanders 7th Overall Benelux Tour 7th Bretagne Classic 10th Dwars door Vlaanderen 2022 4th Gent–Wevelgem 7th Paris–Roubaix 9th Overall Danmark Rundt 9th Classic Brugge–De Panne 10th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2023 3rd Road race, National Championships 4th Overall Renewi Tour 5th Overall Tour of Belgium 6th Road race, UCI World Championships 7th Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen 10th Milan–San Remo 10th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 2024 2nd E3 Saxo Classic 7th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 8th Milan–San Remo 10th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 2023 1st UEC European Championships 1st National Championships "Trek-Segafredo announce official 2019 rosters for men and women".
