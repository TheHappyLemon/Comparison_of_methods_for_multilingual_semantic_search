It hosts the administration of Monastyryska urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 5,380 (2022 estimate). Its older name was Monastyryshche (Монастирище), which gave rise to the Yiddish name Monastrishtsh.

From 1454 to 1465, Monastyryska was owned by Teodorik Buchatsky-Yazlovetsky, later by Mykhailo "Muzhyla" Buchatsky, and from 1468, it was possessed by Jan of Yazlovets. By 1478, Jan of Porokhova had ownership. In 1454, it is noted as a town with Magdeburg rights and a castle. For most of its history, the city belonged to the Kingdom of Poland. From the mid-14th century to 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), it was part of Ruthenian Voivodeship. Monastyryska received a town charter in 1454, and in February 1653, a battle between Polish and Cossack troops took place here, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. The Polish army under Stefan Czarniecki failed to capture the town, defended by Ivan Bohun. After the partitions of Poland, Monastyryska was annexed by the Habsburg Empire. It remained in the province of Galicia until November 1918. In the Second Polish Republic, it was part of Buchach County, Tarnopol Voivodeship. Following the Soviet Invasion of Poland (September 17, 1939), the town was annexed by the Soviet Union. Many Lemkos families came to Monastyryska after Operation Vistula. Since 1991, it has belonged to independent Ukraine. Until 18 July 2020, Monastyryska was the administrative center of Monastyryska Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ternopil Oblast to three. The area of Monastyryska Raion was merged into Chortkiv Raion. Monastyryska has one of the largest Roman Catholic cemeteries in the region of Podole, with more than 2,000 stone tombs. The cemetery has the burial chapel of the Potocki family as well as a military chapel, where veterans of the January Uprising and soldiers of the World War I Polish Legions rest.
