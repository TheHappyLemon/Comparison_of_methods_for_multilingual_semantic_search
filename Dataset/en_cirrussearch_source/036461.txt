Melissic acid (or triacontanoic acid) is the organic compound with the formula CH3(CH2)28CO2H. It is classified as a very long chain fatty acid, a subset of saturated fatty acids. It is a white solid that is soluble in organic solvents. Melissic acid gets its name from the Greek word melissa meaning bee, since it was found in beeswax. n-Triacontanoic acid was synthesized by Bleyberg and Ulrich (1931) and by G.M. Robinson. Triacontanoic acid and triacontanamide (CH3(CH2)28-CONH2) can be self-assembled.
