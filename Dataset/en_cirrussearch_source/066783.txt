The Communist University of the National Minorities of the West (KUNMZ – Kommunistichesky Universitet Natsionalnykh Menshinstv Zapada; КУНМЗ - Коммунистический университет национальных меньшинств Запада) was created by a 28 November 1921 decree of the Council of People's Commissars and charged with training party cadres from the western regions of Russia and the Volga Germans. The first rector of the university was the Polish communist Julian Marchlewski, which the university was later named after. In 1929–1930, it began to admit representatives of the communist parties of the Central European, Scandinavian, and Balkan countries, as well as Italy.
