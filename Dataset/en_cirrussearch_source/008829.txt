She was awarded with diplomas at the Tallinn graphics triennials (1983, 1987, 1989), with a silver medal at the Paris Spring Salon (1984) and at the 2nd miniature graphics triennial in Riga, she received the Riga City Prize and a commemorative medal (1987). Dragūne's works are in the collections of various Latvian museums, as well as in private collections in Latvia and abroad. Dragune's black and white lithographs are characterized by strong contrasts, painterly tonal transitions, the multi-layered nature of the artistic image, and poetics permeated with sharp irony. The portraits reveal the continuity and changeability of the development of a person's inner world. The artist realizes book illustrations in the technique of lithography, watercolour, gouache, ink and crayon drawing, harmonizing all the elements of book construction in a single artistic ensemble.
