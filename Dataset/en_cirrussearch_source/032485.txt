Johan Vansummeren (born 4 February 1981) is a Belgian former professional road racing cyclist, who rode professionally between 2004 and 2016 for the Relax–Bodysol, Silence–Lotto, Garmin–Sharp and AG2R La Mondiale teams. Vansummeren was born, raised, and resides in Lommel, Flanders, Belgium. After two seasons in the amateur ranks, Vansummeren turned professional with Relax–Bodysol in 2004. Although Vansummeren's role was primarily that of a domestique, he competed as a team leader during the classic season. In 2011, Vansummeren won the biggest race of his career, Paris–Roubaix. Vansummeren won the race after escaping from three other riders with 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) remaining, winning by nineteen seconds at the velodrome in Roubaix. He was victorious, despite riding the final 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) with a flat tire. Vansummeren also won the 2007 Tour de Pologne and rode the Tour de France nine times. Vansummeren signed with AG2R La Mondiale for the 2015 and 2016 seasons. In June 2016, he announced his retirement from the sport after being diagnosed with a heart problem that had been detected in February at the Tour of Oman and resulted in him missing the classics season. 1999 1st Overall Junior Tour of Wales 2001 4th Overall Le Triptyque des Monts et Châteaux 4th Circuit de Wallonie 5th Overall Ronde de l'Isard 1st Stage 5 8th Grand Prix de Waregem 2002 1st Circuit de Wallonie 1st Zellik–Galmaarden 3rd Overall Le Triptyque des Monts et Châteaux 5th Ronde van Vlaanderen U23 2003 1st Liège–Bastogne–Liège Espoirs 2nd Road race, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 3rd Beverbeek Classic 4th Ronde van Vlaanderen U23 7th Overall Tour of Slovenia 9th Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 10th Overall Tour de Normandie 10th Overall Le Triptyque des Monts et Châteaux 2004 8th Grand Prix Rudy Dhaenens 10th Grand Prix Eddy Merckx (with Bert Roesems) 2005 4th Overall Tour Down Under 2006 1st Points classification Tour of Britain 5th Road race, National Road Championships 9th Grand Prix d'Isbergues 2007 1st Overall Tour de Pologne 1st Stage 7 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 2008 8th Paris–Roubaix 2009 5th Paris–Roubaix 10th Clásica de San Sebastián 2011 1st Paris–Roubaix 1st Duo Normand (with Thomas Dekker) 2012 1st Stage 2 (TTT) Tour of Qatar 9th Paris–Roubaix 10th Strade Bianche 2014 10th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne "Profile of Johan Vansummeren".
