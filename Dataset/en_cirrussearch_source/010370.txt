The Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2012 was the tenth edition of the annual Junior Eurovision Song Contest. It took place at the Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands on 1 December 2012. Dutch broadcaster AVRO was the host broadcaster for the event. For the second time the Netherlands hosted the contest, after hosting the contest in 2007 in Rotterdam. The show was hosted by Kim-Lian van der Meij for a second time, this time joined by Ewout Genemans. The motto for the contest was "Break The Ice". Twelve countries took part in the contest, making it the smallest number of countries participating in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest history, and equalling the number of countries participated in the 1970 Eurovision Song Contest held at RAI Congrescentrum. Albania and Azerbaijan, and Israel made their debuts at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. Whilst nine countries from the previous edition continued their participation in the contest, four countries withdrew: Lithuania, Bulgaria, Latvia and Macedonia. The contest was won by Anastasiya Petryk for Ukraine with the song "Nebo". Georgia and Armenia finished in second and third place, respectively. This was Ukraine's first Junior Eurovision victory and second Eurovision victory after Ruslana won the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest in Istanbul. Ukraine's winning margin of 35 points was also a record. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) invited broadcasters to bid for the rights to host the contest. On 11 October 2011, the EBU announced that the Dutch broadcaster AVRO had won the right to host next year's event. On 27 February 2012, it was announced that the tenth edition of the contest would take place on 1 December and be held at the Heineken Music Hall (or commonly abbreviated as HMH) in Amsterdam. The Heineken Music Hall was specially designed for music shows, several artists like Madonna and Kylie Minogue made shows at the venue. Furthermore, it is often used by the Dutch Entertainment Company Q-dance for the Event-Series X-Qlusive taking place several times a year. The big hall (also called Black Box) has been used for concerts and boasts a capacity of 5,500 and is 3000 m². After parties are given in a smaller hall, with a capacity of 700. On 1 September 2012, it was confirmed that twelve countries would be taking part in the contest. This was the lowest number of entries since 2009. Débutante countries included, Albania, Azerbaijan, and Israel. Latvia and Lithuania withdrew after competing since 2010, while Bulgaria and Macedonia withdrew after competing in the 2011 edition. Prior to the event, a digital compilation album featuring all the songs from the 2012 contest, along with karaoke versions, was put together by the European Broadcasting Union and released by Universal Music Group on November 2012. The Russian representative, Lerika, has participated in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest before; she represented Moldova in 2011, finishing in 6th place with the song "No, No". This is the second case in the competition to feature a returning artist from previous editions after Katya Ryabova (Russia 2009 and 2011). In January 2012, it was announced that Ewout Genemans alongside Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2007 co-host Kim-Lian van der Meij would present the contest later in the year. Genemans had been involved with the contest for the past two years, having hosted the Dutch national selection for the contest, Junior Songfestival in 2010 and 2011. In December 2011, Genemans signed a 2 year exclusivity deal with the host broadcaster to present shows only on their station. Dutch entertainer and singer Kim Lian reprised her role as host again, after hosting the contest from the Ahoy Arena in 2007 alongside Sipke Jan Bousema. The architect was Frits van Dongen.
