The 2015 UCI World Tour was the seventh edition of the ranking system launched by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 2009. The series started with the opening stage of the Tour Down Under on 20 January, and concluded with Il Lombardia on 4 October. For the second successive year, Spain's Alejandro Valverde won the World Tour individual points title, amassing 675 points over the course of the season. The Movistar Team rider finished 201 points clear of his closest rival and compatriot Joaquim Rodríguez of Team Katusha, while Colombian rider Nairo Quintana was third – also for the Movistar Team – 17 points behind Rodríguez and 218 points in arrears of Valverde. In the teams' rankings, Movistar Team finished top for the third year running, with a total of 1619 points. Second place went to Team Katusha, 13 points behind, while Team Sky finished in third position. The nations' rankings was comfortably headed by Spain, with a points advantage of 839 over Italy, who moved into second at the final race  with Vincenzo Nibali's victory at Il Lombardia. The UCI WorldTeams competed in the World Tour, with UCI Professional Continental teams, or national squads, able to enter at the discretion of the organisers of each event. All events from the 2014 UCI World Tour are included, except the Tour of Beijing, which will no longer be organised. Notes As Ponzi rode for Southeast Pro Cycling, which is not a World Tour team, he was ineligible to score points towards the UCI World Tour standings. The World Team Time Trial Championship awards points only in the team rankings, not in the individual or national standings. Riders tied with the same number of points were classified by number of victories, then number of second places, third places, and so on, in World Tour events and stages. 215 riders scored points. 48 other riders finished in positions that would have earned them points, but they were ineligible as members of non-WorldTour teams. Team rankings were calculated by adding the ranking points of the top five riders of a team in the table, plus points gained in the World Team Time Trial Championship (WTTT). National rankings were calculated by adding the ranking points of the top five riders registered in a nation in the table. The national rankings, as of 15 August, were also used to determine how many riders a country could have in the World Championships. Riders from 34 countries scored points.
