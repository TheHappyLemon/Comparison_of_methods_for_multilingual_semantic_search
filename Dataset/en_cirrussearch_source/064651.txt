The Qualley siblings spent their early years on a ranch in Missoula, Montana, moving to Asheville, North Carolina, when Margaret was four. Qualley's parents separated when she was five years old, and she subsequently split her time equally between them. For many years, her parents lived just 3 miles (5 km) apart. Her family home with MacDowell is in North Carolina, where they have extended family nearby. As a teenager growing up in Asheville, North Carolina, she and her sister were both debutantes, and Qualley made her debut at the Bal des débutantes in Paris.

However, at the age of 16, following an offer to become an apprentice with the North Carolina Dance Theater company, Qualley decided to quit dance. In order to stay in New York, she began working as a model. Of this period, Qualley says: "I wrote to my mom saying: 'Look, I don't think I want to be a dancer any more so I'm going to quit ballet and stay here. I will have this and this income next week.' I laid it out in a way that she couldn't say no because I was so organized." Qualley later changed her focus to acting and attended London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art summer program.
