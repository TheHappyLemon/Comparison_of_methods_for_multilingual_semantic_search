I was captain of the team at Eupen, while I was a year younger than the rest. The national youth coaches followed me, Standard informed me several times. even then I was too timid to take that step.

It's so sad to have a rich country and the people there being so poor. It's not normal. They don't have to be afraid of what could be the consequences if they don't vote for this guy or that guy. They need to have the courage. They need to respect the final decision and not, like so many times [in the past], go on the streets and create some chaos. But first of all they need to vote with courage." In October 2017, Kabasele spoke about his use of social media, saying: "I'm only Christian Kabasele, I'm not the football player so on Twitter I'm just a normal person. It's good for me and the fans to have that kind of interaction, but I'm just myself."
