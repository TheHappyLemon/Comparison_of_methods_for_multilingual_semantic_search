Cape Buor Khaya, (Russian: Мыс Буор-Хая; Mys Buor-Khaya) is a headland in the Laptev Sea. It is located between the Buor-Khaya Gulf on the west and the Yana Bay on the east. It is a conspicuous headland and has an 11 m high light on a framework tower. The sea in the area surrounding the cape is frozen for about nine months every year and often clogged with ice floes. On its eastern side there is a long semi-submerged landspit known as Kosa Buor-Khaya. Administratively the Buor-Khaya Cape belongs to the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) of the Russian Federation. The area has a subarctic climate (Dfc) bordering on a tundra climate (ET).
