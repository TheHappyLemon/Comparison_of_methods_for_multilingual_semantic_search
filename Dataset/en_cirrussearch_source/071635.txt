The 2024 World Athletics Indoor Championships was the 19th edition of the international indoor track and field competition, organised by the World Athletics. The event was held between 1–3 March at the Commonwealth Arena in Glasgow, United Kingdom. It was the third time, after Birmingham 2003 and 2018, that the World Indoor Championships were held in the United Kingdom, and the first time in Scotland. Glasgow hosted the European Athletics Indoor Championships in 1990 and 2019, and as in the latter, the competitions again took place at the Commonwealth Arena. The event is five months before the 2024 Summer Olympics and is a part of the qualification process for these Games. Bidding began in March 2021 with final presentations in the autumn that year. Glasgow, Toruń of Poland and Almaty in Kazakhstan submitted bids to host the 2024 World Athletics Indoor Championships. On 1 December 2021, at their meeting in Monaco, the World Athletics Council chose Glasgow to host the 19th edition of championships.
