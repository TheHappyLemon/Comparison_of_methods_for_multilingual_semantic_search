Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is currently the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body. The "formula" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and vehicles must conform. The Formula One World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. The results of each race are combined to determine two annual championships, one for drivers (World Drivers' Championship), and one for constructors (World Constructors' Championship). This list is for the circuits that hosted World Championship races from 1950 until now. The terms "Formula One race" and "World Championship race" were not always synonymous throughout history – see Formula One § Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races for a detailed explanation. The first World Championship Grand Prix was held in 1950 at Silverstone; since then 77 circuits in total have hosted a Grand Prix. A lot of classic (older) circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations throughout their history: Nürburgring, Spa-Francorchamps, Monza, etc. Taking Nürburgring as an example, the first World Championship race there used the 22.835 km (14.189 mi) configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent Grands Prix have used a shorter, safer circuit. Formula One circuits were predominantly in Europe during the early years of the championship; as the sport has expanded, so has the location of its circuits. The expansion into Asia and America has been a recent occurrence. Of the 20 circuits that hosted a Grand Prix in 2012, nearly half were not on the calendar before 1999. The Autodromo Nazionale Monza has hosted the most World Championship races; the only season it did not host a race was in 1980, when the Italian Grand Prix was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari. The Las Vegas Strip Circuit became the 77th circuit to host a Grand Prix, when it held the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023; this is the latest addition to this list. The longest circuit to have hosted a Grand Prix is the Pescara Circuit, which hosted the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix: the 25.800 km (16.031 mi) long circuit in Pescara, Italy, held the annual Coppa Acerbo race, and in 1957 it was the only time that this race was included as part of the World Championship, a race which Stirling Moss won. As some circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations, the most recent configuration used is listed in the table below. The "Circuit" column uses the name contemporary to the last time the circuit was used in Formula One. The "Map" column shows a diagram of the latest configuration on current tracks and the last configuration used on past tracks. The "Type" column refers to the type of circuit: "street" is a circuit held on closed city streets, "road" refers to a mixture of public roads and a permanent track, and "race" is a permanent facility. The "Last length used" shows the track length for the configuration that was used last time the Formula One race was held on a given track. The "Direction" column shows the direction for the configuration that was used last time the Formula One race was held on a given track. Silverstone Circuit and the Bahrain International Circuit held two races each in 2020. From 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 was part of the World Championship. The Red Bull Ring held two races per season in both 2020 and 2021. General Hughes, Mark; Tremayne, David (2002). The Concise Encyclopedia of Formula 1. Parragon. pp. 70–93. ISBN 0-75258-766-8.
