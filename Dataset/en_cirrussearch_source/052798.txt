Alexey Alexandrovich Lutsenko (Kazakh: Алексей Александрович Луценко; born 7 September 1992) is a Kazakh professional cyclist, who rides for UCI WorldTeam Astana Qazaqstan Team. In 2012 he won the under-23 road race at the UCI Road World Championships in the Netherlands. At the 2015 Tour de Suisse, Lutsenko put in an attack after the penultimate climb of the day and it led him to victory on stage 8. In 2019, Lutsenko had his most prolific season to that point, with ten individual victories. His first start of the season, the Tour of Oman, saw him win three stages, the points classification and the overall general classification. After top-ten finishes at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad (fourth) and Strade Bianche (seventh), Lutsenko won a stage and the mountains classification at Tirreno–Adriatico. He finished seventh overall at the Critérium du Dauphiné, before winning both the time trial and the road race by more than a minute at the Kazakh National Road Championships. After finishing inside the top twenty placings at the Tour de France, Lutsenko won the Arctic Race of Norway on the final stage, overturning a three-second pre-stage deficit to Warren Barguil. He finished fourth at the Deutschland Tour and second at the Coppa Ugo Agostoni before two wins in three days, at the Coppa Sabatini and the Memorial Marco Pantani – becoming the latter race's first non-Italian winner. At the start of the 2020 season, and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic-enforced suspension of racing, Lutsenko took third-place overall finishes at the Tour de la Provence (winning the points classification), and the UAE Tour. He then won the sixth stage of the Tour de France following a 17-kilometre (11-mile) solo attack. Lutsenko's next victory did not come until the 2021 Critérium du Dauphiné, when he won the fourth stage individual time trial. He moved into the race lead after the sixth stage, but ultimately finished second overall behind Richie Porte. He recorded his best overall finish at the Tour de France with a seventh-place finish in the 2021 edition, but took only one further victory during the rest of the year, at the Coppa Ugo Agostoni. Lutsenko opened his 2022 season with victory in the inaugural edition of the Clásica Jaén Paraíso Interior, soloing the last 25 kilometres (16 miles) to the win. He finished inside the top ten placings at the Vuelta a Andalucía (ninth), missing out on a stage victory to Wout Poels in a two-up sprint in Baza. At the Tour de France, he worked his way up the general classification, moving into the top ten overall after two high stage finishes on consecutive summit finishes at Peyragudes and Hautacam. He ultimately finished 9th, almost 23 minutes down on race winner Jonas Vingegaard. Lutsenko and his family live in Monaco.
