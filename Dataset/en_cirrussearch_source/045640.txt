Manninen made his Liiga debut playing with Oulun Kärpät during the 2013–14 Liiga season. After the 2018–19 season, placing second on Jokerit in scoring with 20 goals and 48 points in 62 games, Manninen was traded by Jokerit to fellow KHL club, Salavat Yulaev Ufa, in exchange for financial considerations and the rights to Miro Heiskanen and Henrik Borgström on 17 May 2019. In March 2022, while in his third season with the club, Manninen left Salavat Yulaev Ufa during playoffs due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

After attending the Golden Knights training camp, Manninen was assigned to play in the American Hockey League (AHL) with affiliate, the Henderson Silver Knights. He remained with the Silver Knights for the duration of the season, posting 40 points through 53 regular season games. As a pending free agent from the Golden Knights, Manninen opted to resume his European career in agreeing to a one-year contract with Swiss-based, Genève-Servette HC of the National League (NL), on 12 May 2023. In 2019 IIHF World Championship Manninen was the point leader of the Finnish national team that claimed the world championship.
