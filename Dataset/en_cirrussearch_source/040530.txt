Yukiya Arashiro (新城幸也, Arashiro Yukiya, born 22 September 1984) is a Japanese road bicycle racer, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Team Bahrain Victorious. Born in Ishigaki, Okinawa Prefecture, Arashiro was the Japanese Under-23 National Time Trial and Road Race Champion in 2005. He has also won the Japanese National Road Race Championships three times, in 2007, 2013 and 2022. In 2009 he was selected by his team to ride the Tour de France. Along with Fumiyuki Beppu, he was the first Japanese national to complete that race, as on prior occasions Kisso Kawamuro and Daisuke Imanaka had started, but not finished, the race. By finishing the 2010 Giro d'Italia, he became the first Japanese person to finish two Grand Tour events. He recorded a third-place stage finish on the fifth stage, behind breakaway companions Jérôme Pineau and Julien Fouchard. He completed his third Tour de France in 2012 in 84th place—the highest placing of a Japanese person at that time—and earned the most combative award on Stage 4. He participated in the men's road race at the 2012 Summer Olympics and finished in 48th place. A few weeks after the Olympics, he became the first Japanese to win a race categorized as HC by the UCI, the Tour du Limousin of the Palais des Sports de Beaublanc in Limoges. Competing in the 2015 Vuelta a España, he became the first Japanese person to finish the three Grand Tours. He finished 27th in the 2016 Summer Olympics men's road race, and 35th in the 2020 Summer Olympics men's road race. Arashiro has completed all sixteen Grand Tours that he has started, with a best finish of 65th at the 2014 Tour de France and the 2015 Vuelta a España. 2005 National Under-23 Road Championships 1st Time trial 1st Road race 9th Tour de Okinawa 2006 3rd Overall Tour du Limousin 3rd Tour de Okinawa 2007 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st Stage 7 Tour of Japan 2nd Overall Vuelta Ciclista a León 1st Mountains classification 2nd Tour du Jura 3rd Overall Tour de Hokkaido 1st Stage 4 3rd Tour de Okinawa 5th Japan Cup 7th Tour du Finistère 2008 1st Overall Tour de Okinawa 1st Stages 1 & 2 Asian Road Championships 3rd Time trial 10th Road race 3rd Overall Tour du Limousin 1st Stage 2 3rd Overall Tour de Kumano 1st Stage 2 5th Overall Tour of Japan 7th Overall Les 3 Jours de Vaucluse 7th Overall Tour de Bretagne 2009 9th Overall Four Days of Dunkirk 10th Trophée des Grimpeurs 10th Grand Prix de Denain 2010 1st Critérium cycliste international de Quillan 5th Paris–Tours 7th Grand Prix de la Somme 9th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 9th Val d'Ille Classic 9th Japan Cup 2011 Asian Road Championships 1st Road race 4th Time trial 2nd Road race, National Road Championships 5th Overall Paris–Corrèze 10th Overall Tour du Limousin 2012 1st Overall Tour du Limousin Combativity award Stage 4 Tour de France 2013 1st Road race, National Road Championships 2nd Overall Tour du Limousin 2014 10th Amstel Gold Race 2015 3rd Japan Cup 5th Paris–Camembert 6th Cholet-Pays de Loire 10th Road race, Asian Road Championships 2016 1st Stage 7 Tour of Japan 2nd Road race, Asian Road Championships 9th Japan Cup Combativity award Stage 6 Tour de France 2017 Asian Road Championships 2nd Team time trial 7th Road race 3rd Hong Kong Challenge 2018 Asian Road Championships 1st Team time trial 5th Road race 1st Overall Tour de Taiwan 2019 2nd Road race, National Road Championships 2022 National Road Championships 1st Road race 3rd Time trial 2023 3rd Road race, Asian Road Championships National Road Championships 3rd Time trial 8th Road race "Bahrain Merida Pro Cycling Team".
