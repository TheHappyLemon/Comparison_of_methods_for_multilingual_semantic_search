Vecbebri Manor (Latvian: Vecbebru muižas pils; German: Alt-Bewershof) is a manor house in the historical region of Vidzeme, in northern Latvia. Vecbebri Manor was built during the first half of the 19th century in Classical style. Severely damaged by fire in 1905, the manor was later restored under the supervision of architect Vilhelms Bokslafs. It became a school building in 1922, and has housed the Bebri comprehensive boarding primary school (Bebru vispārizglītojošā internātpamatskola) since 1996.
