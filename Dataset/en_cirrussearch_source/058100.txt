Clermont Foot 63 (Occitan: Clarmont d'Auvèrnhe; commonly referred to as Clermont Foot or simply Clermont) is a French professional football club based in Clermont-Ferrand, France. As of the 2023–24 season, it competes in Ligue 1. The first incarnation of the club was formed in 1911 and the current club was created in 1990 as a result of a merger. The club plays its home matches at the Stade Gabriel-Montpied located within the city. Between 2014 and 2017, Clermont was managed by Corinne Diacre, the first woman to manage a men's professional football team. In 2021, the club achieved promotion to Ligue 1 for the first time in its history. The club started in 1911 under the name Stade Clermontois. Despite little league success in the early days, they reached the semi-finals of the Coupe de France during the 1945–46 season.[citation needed] Their professional status was repealed after the 1946–47 season due to financial difficulties.[citation needed] The club became professional again in 1966.[citation needed] 1984 saw an expansion, with Stade-Clermontois and AS Montferrand merging to form Clermont-Ferrand Football Club (CFC).[citation needed] The club was placed in the third division. The club was later renamed Clermont Foot Auvergne, having to start again in the Division Honneur. After 13 years, Clermont Foot got promoted multiple times, from the Division Honneur up to Ligue 2 in 1993.[citation needed] During these 13 years of success, the club had numerous successes in the Coupe de France. One notable cup run was in 1997, when the Auvergne club eliminated three professional sides, Martigues, Lorient and then Paris Saint-Germain,[citation needed] before succumbing to Nice.[citation needed] The club won the Championnat National in 2007,[citation needed] being promoted to Ligue 2 again, from which they had been relegated in 2006. In 2014, Clermont became the first French professional men's team to appoint a female manager when they appointed Helena Costa. Less than a month after taking charge, Costa quit her role, and was replaced by another woman, Corinne Diacre, who would go on to train the French women's team. Clermont were promoted to Ligue 1 for the 2021–22 season for the first time in their history, having achieved promotion to the league after finishing second in the 2020–21 edition of Ligue 2.
