Ángel Ganivet García (13 December 1865 in Granada, Spain – 29 November 1898 in Riga) was a Spanish writer and diplomat. He was considered a precursor to the Generation of '98. On 29 November 1898, disillusioned in love, Ganivet drowned himself in the Daugava River. Nearly failing in his attempt, he was first rescued but managed to throw himself into the river again. Ganivet had contemplated suicide for several years, and he had suffered from progressive syphilitic paralysis. Granada la bella. (1896) (Granada the Beautiful) Idearium español.
