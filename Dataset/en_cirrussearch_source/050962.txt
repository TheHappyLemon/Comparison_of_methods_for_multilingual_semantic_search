The GSP Stadium (Greek: Στάδιο ΓΣΠ) is a football stadium in Strovolos, Nicosia District, Cyprus. Although small by international standards, it is the largest stadium in Cyprus, with a capacity of 22,859 and was opened in 1999. It serves as the home stadium for the 3 biggest football clubs of Nicosia APOEL, Olympiakos & Omonia. It is also the home stadium of the Cyprus national football team. A stadium under the same name, the old GSP Stadium, existed from 1902 until 1999 in the centre of Nicosia and had a capacity of 12,000. Designed by Theo. David Architects, the new GSP Stadium opened for use on 6 October 1999. The complex has three arenas: a football stadium, an athletics stadium and an auxiliary football pitch intended for training. The stadium is owned by the Pancyprian Gymnastic Association. With an official seating capacity of 22,859 the GCP Stadium is the largest football venue in Cyprus. It is located at the entrance to Nicosia (as approached from the A1 highway) and was inaugurated in 1999 by the then-President Glafcos Clerides and Archbishop Chrysostomos I. The first game was held on 6 October 1999 and there was a friendly match between APOEL and Omonia, which ended 3–3. Since then, the stadium is not only the home of Nicosian teams but usually of Cyprus national football team. During the World Cup 2006 qualifying round it was used as home for all matches of Cyprus. The stadium is the only one in Cyprus which satisfies UEFA Criteria. For this reason since 2004 it is used as home for all the teams of Cyprus in European Cups. Annually, the stadium hosts the Cypriot Super Cup. Also until 2005, it was hosting annually the Cypriot Cup final. In 2002, the stadium was home for Israeli clubs for the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League matches. It hosted the UEFA Cup quarter final (as home for Hapoel Tel Aviv) between Hapoel Tel Aviv and A.C. Milan. It was also used by Maccabi Haifa for home stadium for the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League group stage matches and for the UEFA Cup matches. Some matches were attractive for Cypriots like the matches Maccabi Haifa-Olympiacos CFP and Maccabi Haifa-Manchester United, since those two Maccabi's rivals are very popular in Cyprus. It's the only stadium in Cyprus build only for track & field games. In addition with the hotel, it provides a full training centre solution for athletes all over the world. During the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, many athletes from different countries used the stadium for training.[citation needed] The GCP Stadium hosted all home matches of Anorthosis Famagusta's 2008–09 UEFA Champions League group stage campaign and all APOEL's 2009–10 UEFA Champions League group stage home matches.

Pancypria participated in the A' Pancyprian Games which took place in the G.S. Olympia Stadium in Limassol.
