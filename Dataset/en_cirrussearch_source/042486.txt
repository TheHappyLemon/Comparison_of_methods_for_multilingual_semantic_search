V magazine writer Dylan Kelly called Steinfeld an "artist of ambidexterity, showcasing supremacy across an impressive repertoire of on-screen roles in film and television", and said "her musical prowess is one of melodic self-growth and good-natured, lyrical wisdom". Steinfeld said in a 2016 interview, "With [my] music, I feel like I get to be myself, tell my own story, and take my life experiences and not put them into another story but into my own words." She went on to say that "music is such a big influence in [her] acting" and that the two "entwine". Variety writer Natalie Weiner stated that Steinfeld has long been injecting "some vague notion of female empowerment [...] into her music. Self-love is a common theme Steinfeld has looked at within her music. Steinfeld has stated that she hopes to be remembered as "an artist that truly cared about the art". She went on to note the "differences between working on a film set and in a studio are multiple", and adding that "she loves the freedom of making music". There's something so freeing about going into a studio. It doesn't matter what time of day it is, doesn't matter what you're wearing or whether you're wearing make-up or not. You go into a room with people that you love and you feel comfortable with, and can be yourself around and be vulnerable and open up and talk about experiences. Magic happens in those moments. Steinfeld has cited Madonna and Rihanna as her biggest musical influences. Other artists Steinfeld has cited as influences include Britney Spears, Tori Kelly, Selena Gomez, Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. Steinfeld noted their "strength, courage and their ability to go out [...] and express themselves". She has also said that she grew up listening to Boyz II Men and Luther Vandross due to her mother's love for them. In 2011, Steinfeld was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the 2010 film True Grit, making her one of the youngest actresses to be nominated in the category. She also received nominations for a BAFTA Award for Best Actress, a SAG Award and a Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress for the same film. In 2016, she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for The Edge of Seventeen. Steinfeld has also won awards for her music, including a 2017 Billboard Music Award for Top Covered Artist for her song "Most Girls". Her 2015 single "Love Myself" debuted on the Billboard Pop Songs chart at number 27 (later peaking at 15), marking the highest debut for a solo female artist on the chart in 17 years, since Natalie Imbruglia's "Torn" in 1998. The song went on to be certified two times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2020, "Most Girls" and Steinfeld's collaboration, with Grey and Zedd titled "Starving", were certified two and four times platinum, respectively, by the RIAA. Steinfeld started dating Instagrammer Cameron Smoller in 2016. They made their public debut as a couple at a Golden Globes party in early 2017 but broke up in November 2017.

On the set of True Grit, Steinfeld created a "swear jar"; every time someone uttered the word "fuck", Steinfeld would collect $5 from the perpetrator, while other vulgarities were worth a dollar. As a trade-off, she had to pay up 50 cents if she said "like". She stated she "matched it and donated it all to an Alzheimer's foundation". Steinfeld has made several public appearances during charity events, such as the Breast Cancer Foundation's 2014 Hot Pink Party, the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball 2015 tour, and WE Day 2019 in California. In 2016, Steinfeld participated in singing "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" with fellow singers and celebrities.
