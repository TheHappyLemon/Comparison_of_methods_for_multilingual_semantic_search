Scott Darling (born December 22, 1988) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender. He previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Chicago Blackhawks and Carolina Hurricanes. Darling was selected by the Phoenix Coyotes in the sixth round, 153rd overall, of the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. Darling won the Stanley Cup as a member of the Blackhawks in 2015, becoming the first Chicago-area native player to do so as a member of the Blackhawks. Darling grew up in Chicago's southern suburb of Lemont, Illinois, and as a child idolized the Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Ed Belfour. He played minor ice hockey with the AA Vikings (Orland Park), AA Huskies (then Darien, now Romeoville) and AAA Team Illinois and Chicago Young Americans. He played in the 2002 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Chicago Young Americans. He attended Notre Dame College in Wilcox, Saskatchewan, in eighth grade and played AAA hockey for the Hounds. He attended Lemont High School. Prior to turning professional, Darling attended the University of Maine, where he played two seasons of NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey with the Black Bears ice hockey team. In the 2013–14 season, Darling enjoyed his most successful American Hockey League (AHL) season, earning 13 wins in 26 games with the Milwaukee Admirals. On July 1, 2014, the Chicago Blackhawks signed Darling as a free agent to his first NHL contract on a one-year deal. Darling made his NHL debut on October 26, 2014, against the Ottawa Senators, making 32 saves in the 2–1 win. He became the first former Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL) player to play in an NHL game. On November 1, 2014, it was announced Darling had been reassigned to the Blackhawks' AHL affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs, following starting goaltender Corey Crawford's recovery from an upper-body injury. However, Darling was recalled two weeks later, on November 15, 2014. On February 22, 2015, Darling was promoted from Rockford and placed onto Chicago's NHL roster, replacing Antti Raanta as the team's backup goaltender, who himself was demoted to Rockford. The Blackhawks also signed Darling to a two-year contract extension. On March 18, 2015, Darling recorded his first NHL shutout in a Blackhawks' victory over the New York Rangers. On April 15, 2015, Darling recorded his first playoff win after replacing Crawford in net, making 42 saves, with the Blackhawks defeating the Nashville Predators 4–3 in double overtime. Darling set an NHL record in his debut for the longest relief appearance without allowing a goal (67:44), as well as the most saves in relief without allowing a goal (42). On June 15, 2015, Darling became the first Chicago-area native player to win a Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks. On April 28, 2017, at the conclusion of the Blackhawks season in 2016–17, Darling's rights as a pending free agent were traded to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for the Ottawa Senators' original third-round pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. On May 6, 2017, Darling agreed to terms with the Hurricanes on a four-year contract. His first season with Carolina was underwhelming, as he recorded a 13–21–7 record with a 3.18 goals against average (GAA).[citation needed] On November 29, 2018, the Hurricanes placed Darling on waivers. At that point, he had a .892 save percentage in seven appearances for the club. He cleared the following day, and joined the Hurricanes' AHL affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers. On February 10, 2019, Darling was granted a "personal leave of absence" from the Charlotte Checkers and the Hurricanes organization for an undetermined period of time. On June 30, 2019, Darling and a 2020 sixth-round draft pick were traded to Florida Panthers in exchange for James Reimer. He was subsequently placed on unconditional waivers for the purpose of buying out the final two years of his contract. Darling signed with Innsbruck HC of the Austrian Hockey League in November 2019. He abruptly returned to the United States in March 2020 following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in Europe. Darling appeared in 33 contests for Innsbruck, where he posted a 3.34 GAA and .898 save percentage prior to his departure. As a free agent, Darling returned from Austria and agreed to a professional tryout contract to attend the Florida Panthers training camp on January 2, 2021. With the Panthers under the leadership of former Chicago Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville, Darling was subsequently released without a contract at the conclusion of camp. On January 26, Darling returned to the roots of his past success in joining the Blackhawks, signing a professional tryout contract (PTO) with the Rockford IceHogs of the AHL, to begin the 2020–21 season. He made a lone appearance in his return to the IceHogs on February 9, allowing five goals on 27 shots. Darling was released from his PTO with the IceHogs on February 17, 2021. He retired from professional hockey after his release. Darling reflected on his career, stating, "I grew up in Chicago, I've been a 'Hawks fan my entire life, I still am a 'Hawks fan. It meant the world to me. My family went to the parade in 2010, I watched 2013 with my mom on her couch and being on the 2015 team and helping them along, oh my God, it makes me emotional just talking about it." Darling played for the United States in the 2018 IIHF World Championship, mainly serving as the backup to Keith Kinkaid. He recorded featured in two wins in as many games with a 2.25 GAA and a .870 save percentage. On May 20, the United States defeated Canada 4–1 to win the bronze medal. Darling played in the Wayne Gretzky Ice Hockey Classic for Team USA in the summer of 2016 in Australia. According to Darling, he was depressed for six months after his retirement, until he began doing stand-up comedy. Darling was recognized by a comedian at Chicago's Laugh Factory comedy club who encouraged Darling to try and open for him. By summer 2022, he toured with comedian Ian Bagg and performed multiple shows in Raleigh. Darling became a studio analyst for Blackhawks coverage on NBC Sports Chicago in October 2022. Born in Newport News, Virginia, Darling was the son of an Army officer who was stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington and Fort Rucker, Alabama before the family finally settled in the Chicago suburb of Lemont. At the University of Maine, he was involved in excessive partying and by his sophomore year was abusing alcohol. He frequently violated the school's code of conduct and was given three suspensions from the hockey team within a 16-month period, resulting in him being dropped. After bouncing around for several years through various minor hockey leagues, his goaltender coach Brian Daccord said he was not permitted to play at his hockey school until he made a dedicated commitment to the gym. It was at this time, he lost nearly 40 pounds and gave up alcohol in 2011. Darling said even at the lowest point, after being cut from what might have been the worst team in organized hockey, he never forgot something his father told him about getting ahead: "It was kind of like his motto—'Saw the wood that's in front of you.' " In 2016, Darling helped a homeless man in Arizona by buying him groceries and renting him a hotel room for the month. The story went viral after Darling's Uber driver shared it with the media. Darling's deed was recognized by President Barack Obama during the Blackhawks' visit to the White House, who recounted the story and praised Darling. Darling, Scott (December 23, 2014).
