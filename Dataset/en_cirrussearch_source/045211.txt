The Parent Trap is a 1998 American romantic comedy film directed and co-written by Nancy Meyers in her feature directorial debut, and produced and co-written by Charles Shyer. It is a remake of the 1961 film of the same name and an adaptation of Erich Kästner's 1949 German novel Lisa and Lottie (Das doppelte Lottchen). Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson star as a divorced couple who separated shortly after their identical twin daughters' birth; Lindsay Lohan stars (in her film debut) as both twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James, who are fortuitously reunited at summer camp after being separated at birth. David Swift wrote the screenplay for the original 1961 film based on Lottie and Lisa. Swift is credited along with Meyers and Shyer as co-writers of the 1998 version. The film premiered in Los Angeles on July 20, 1998, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 29, and was a box-office hit, grossing $92.1 million against a $15 million budget. It received positive reviews from critics, with Lohan's performance, in particular, earning high praise. In 1986, Nicholas "Nick" Parker and Elizabeth James meet and fall in love on the Queen Elizabeth 2. They eventually marry and have twin daughters, Hallie and Annie. However, they divorce shortly after the twins' birth. Nick gains custody over Hallie and raises her on his vineyard in Napa, California, while Elizabeth raises Annie in London, England, where she works as a wedding gown designer. Eleven years and nine months later, the twins are coincidentally sent to the same summer camp, where they form an intense rivalry. After Hallie and her friends perform a dangerous prank on Annie's cabin, the twins are sent to the isolation cabin, where they begin to bond over their similarities. After discovering the parallels between their respective family situations, they show one another a photograph of their parents and realize that they are twins who were separated at birth. They decide to switch places to convince their parents to reconcile; each girl trains the other to act like her. In London, Hallie happily meets Elizabeth, the family butler Martin, and her maternal grandfather Charles, while Annie meets Nick and their family nanny Chessy in California. Much to Annie's dismay, she learns that Nick is engaged to Meredith Blake, a 26-year-old publicist from San Francisco who only wants to marry Nick for his fortune. Meredith is planning on sending Hallie to boarding school once she and Nick get married. Annie phones Hallie and implores her to bring their mother to California to try and break up Nick and Meredith, but Hallie refuses, desperate to spend more one-on-one time with Elizabeth. After Chessy notices changes in "Hallie's" behavior, Annie confesses her identity to Chessy, and Chessy agrees to keep it a secret from Nick. While on the phone with Annie discussing Nick's impending wedding to Meredith, Hallie is caught by Charles, who encourages her to tell Elizabeth the truth. After telling Elizabeth the truth, the two decide to travel to California to establish joint custody of the twins between each parent. The twins, with the help of Martin and Chessy, arrange for a meeting between Nick and Elizabeth at the Stafford Hotel in California. Upon reuniting with Elizabeth, Nick learns that he has had Annie with him since the end of camp, though he is delighted by this. Elizabeth also meets Meredith and learns of her engagement with Nick. Annie and Hallie attempt to recreate the night their parents met by arranging dinner on a yacht. Nick and Elizabeth discuss their breakup, which occurred when Elizabeth ran off after a fight, secretly hoping that Nick would follow her. They agree on shared custody but decide against resuming their relationship. Elizabeth plans to fly back to London with Annie the next day, but the twins refuse to reveal which one is which unless the entire family takes a camping trip. Elizabeth insists that Meredith go in her place so that she can become acquainted with the twins before marrying Nick. On the trip, the twins play a series of pranks on Meredith, leading to her furiously demanding that Nick choose between her or them. Finally seeing Meredith's true nature, Nick breaks up with her. After the camping trip, Nick and Elizabeth realize that they are still in love, but decide to go their separate ways, each with the twin they have respective custody of. When Elizabeth and Annie arrive back in London, they find Nick and Hallie, who took a faster flight. Nick says that he did not want to make the same mistake of not going after Elizabeth again, and they share a kiss. Elizabeth and Nick have remarried with Hallie and Annie as their bridesmaids and Chessy and Martin have become engaged.

Simon Kunz as Martin, the James family's butler, who falls in love with Chessy. He is based on Staimes, the McKendrick family's chauffeur from the original film.

Meyers and Shyer's daughters Hallie Meyers-Shyer and Annie Meyers-Shyer make appearances in the film, credited as Lindsay and Towel Girl, respectively. Lohan's brother Michael (credited as Lost Boy At Camp) plays a boy at Camp Walden who did not realize he was going to an all-girls camp. Lohan's mother, Dina, and other siblings Aliana and Dakota, all appear in uncredited cameos at the airport in London. The film's cinematographer Dean Cundey appears in an uncredited cameo as the captain of the Queen Elizabeth 2, who marries Nick and Elizabeth at the beginning of the film. Jeannette Charles portrayed Queen Elizabeth II in a deleted scene in which she and Hallie meet. Casting More than 1,500 young actresses submitted audition tapes for the dual roles of Hallie and Annie. Director Nancy Meyers was looking for "a little Diane Keaton" to play the parts. Before Lohan was cast in the roles, actresses Scarlett Johansson, Mara Wilson, Michelle Trachtenberg, and Jena Malone all either auditioned or were considered for the roles, with Malone turning the roles down multiple times. Filming Principal photography started on July 15, 1997, in London, United Kingdom, and continued in Napa Valley AVA, San Francisco, Lake Arrowhead, and Los Angeles, California to December 17, 1997. Camp Walden was filmed on location at Camp Seely in Crestline, California. Parker Knoll, the vineyard and residence of the Parker family in the film, was shot on location in Rutherford, California at Staglin Family Vineyard. The exterior of the fictional Stafford Hotel was shot at The Langham Huntington in Pasadena, California and the Administration Building, Treasure Island in San Francisco, while the interior and pool scenes were shot at the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey, California. Book In 1962, a year after Disney originally adapted Das doppelte Lottchen into The Parent Trap, Cyrus Brooks translated the German book into English as Lisa and Lottie, an edition still published in the United States and Canada. In 2014, Das doppelte Lottchen was faithfully retranslated into English by Anthea Bell and republished in the United Kingdom and Australia by Pushkin Press as The Parent Trap, after Disney's hit film adaptations. Then in 2020, Australian actress Ruby Rees recorded an unabridged narration of Bell's translation for Bolinda. There are several connections between this film and the original 1961 version: The characters Marva Kulp Sr. and Marva Kulp Jr. are named after Nancy Kulp, the actress who played a camp counselor in the 1961 film, Miss Grunecker. Both versions of the film feature product placement by Nabisco. In the 1998 film, Oreos are featured, while in the 1961 film, Fig Newtons are featured. During the poolside scene where Annie and Meredith meet for the first time, Meredith speaks on the phone with someone named Reverend Mosby, who was a character in the 1961 film played by Leo G. Carroll. Joanna Barnes appears in both films, playing Vicky Robinson in the 1961 film, and Vicki Blake in the 1998 version. She also calls Annie (as Hallie) "pet", which Vicky Robinson did to Sharon (as Susan). The Stafford Hotel is named after a boy in the 1961 film that accepts the boy's camp invitation to the dance at the beginning of the film. Right before Hallie meets Meredith for the first time, Hallie can be heard singing a few bars of "Let's Get Together", a song from the 1961 version that was originally sung by Hayley Mills. There are bunkhouses named Arapahoe in both films. Hallie (as Annie) "smells" her grandfather, saying he smells of peppermint and pipe tobacco. Susan (as Sharon) does the same in the 1961 film. Both films have the same run time (2 hours and 9 minutes). The song used in the opening sequence, in which glimpses of Nick and Elizabeth's first wedding are seen, is Nat King Cole's "L-O-V-E". The song used in the end credits, in which photos of Nick and Elizabeth's second wedding are seen, is his daughter Natalie Cole's "This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)". The instrumental music featured prominently in the hotel scene where the girls and their parents cross paths serendipitously is "In the Mood", which was previously made famous by the Glenn Miller band. The song "Let's Get Together" is also quoted over the Walt Disney Pictures logo, and at the end of Alan Silvestri's closing credits suite. When Hallie shows up at Annie's poker game at Camp Walden, the music used is "Bad to the Bone" by George Thorogood and the Destroyers. The tune playing as Hallie and Annie are making their way up to the Isolation Cabin is the main theme from "The Great Escape" by Elmer Bernstein. The song coming from the radio in Meredith's car as she pulls up to the Parkers' home is "Parents Just Don't Understand" by DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. The background song heard in the campfire scene is "How Bizarre" by the music group OMC. The song playing as Annie, Elizabeth, and Martin say goodbye to Hallie, Nick, and Chessy toward the end of the film is "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye", performed by Ray Charles and Betty Carter. All tracks are written by Alan Silvestri 1.^ Not featured in the motion picture. The film premiered in Los Angeles on July 20, 1998. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $11,148,497 in 2,247 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #2 at the box office, behind Saving Private Ryan.

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 87% based on 53 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website's critics consensus states: "Writer-director Nancy Meyers takes the winning formula of the 1961 original and gives it an amiable modern spin, while young star Lindsay Lohan shines in her breakout role." Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based from 19 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale. Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert each gave the film three stars. Critic Kenneth Turan called Lohan "the soul of this film as much as Hayley Mills was of the original", going on to say that "she is more adept than her predecessor at creating two distinct personalities". Lohan won a Young Artist Award for best performance in a feature film. In a 2021 interview, the star of the original film, Hayley Mills, said, "It was so like the one I did, and yet not. But I thought it was really good." She also praised Lohan's performance, calling her "excellent". The Parent Trap was originally released on VHS in the United States on December 8, 1998. A 20th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray was released as a Disney Movie Club Exclusive on April 24, 2018. The film was also available as a launch title on Disney+. On February 21, 2018, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that remakes of several films are in development as exclusive content for The Walt Disney Company's streaming service Disney+ with one of those projects named in the announcement as The Parent Trap. Malayalam TV series Kasthooriman Season 2 is a loose adaptation of the movie. On July 20, 2020, Katie Couric moderated a virtual cast reunion through her Instagram account for the film's 22nd anniversary. Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Elaine Hendrix, Lisa Ann Walter, Simon Kunz, Nancy Meyers, and Charles Shyer all participated in the video chat. A charity fundraising effort during the COVID-19 pandemic, the reunion special helped raise money for chef José Andrés' non-profit organization World Central Kitchen. Quaid then released an extended version of the reunion on his podcast The Dennissance on the following day. "The Parent Trap: 128 minutes (Starz 01/2010 Schedule, Page 4)" (PDF).
