The Group expanded in Europe through numerous acquisitions and subsidiaries in Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Greece, Spain, the Netherlands and Finland.

In 2008 a class action lawsuit was filed against Salt Lake City-based Teleperformance USA seeking unpaid wages for employees, alleging a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. On 19 May 2010, a settlement was reached for approximately $2 million to be paid to 15,862 workers in 10 US states. A group of labor unions filed a complaint documenting unsafe working conditions, monitoring, surveillance, union busting and retaliation against employees in ten countries in April 2020. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, workers in the Philippines, including those supporting Amazon's Ring camera contract, had nowhere to sleep but at their workspaces and were unable to meet social distancing requirements. The Financial Times was able to verify this with video and photos, including in a Cebu City office. After the working conditions were made public, the company promised to make improvements, but NBC News reported after six months the company was providing intermittent shuttle service, not properly sanitizing working spaces, and sending workers home without pay if they were quarantined. While Amazon required support contractors to be onsite, Netflix's contract with Teleperformance allowed employees to work from home. In Colombia, the union Utraclaro, part of the UNI Global Union, has organized Teleperformance employees, including moderators. In 2021, after the union submitted its demands for the company to protect freedom of association, Teleperformance filed a lawsuit against the union in a labor court. In November 2022, the Ministry of Labour launched an investigation into the company. After the investigation, shares in the company dropped by 34%. Following the allegations, Teleperformance hired Bureau Veritas to audit its employee management practices, including corporate social responsibility and compliance with local labour laws. In December 2022, the subsidiary received independent certification from Bureau Veritas on the "use and inclusion of the international standard ISO 26000 in the field of social responsibility within its operations in Colombia." In April and May 2023, the company signed agreements allowing workers in Colombia, Romania and Poland to unionize. The company also stated, in its 2023 first-half results, that the Colombian government had closed its investigation with no findings against it. Workers in Colombia, including those working on contracts for Apple, are reportedly remotely monitored by the company, including by AI-enabled cameras and voice recording using its own TP Cloud Campus platform. The company issued a press release in July 2021 stating that 240,000 employees in 52 countries were using the platform by mid-2021. Workers in Albania, including those working on Apple content, were protected from webcam monitoring at home through their Data Protection Commission. Teleperformance employs content moderators for platforms including TikTok, with moderators in Tunisia and Colombia, reviewing explicit content to remove it from the platform. Its "Trust and Safety" branch and moderation program were launched in 2019. After an investigation by Forbes reported that the company retained material with child sexual abuse, Teleperformance and TikTok were criticized by the United States Senate Committee on Commerce and by shareholders. In November 2022, the company announced that it would exit "the highly egregious part of the trust and safety business." However, it reversed its decision in March 2023.
