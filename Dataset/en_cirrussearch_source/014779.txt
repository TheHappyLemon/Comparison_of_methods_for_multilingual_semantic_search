Židikai (Samogitian: Žėdėkā) is a town in Mažeikiai district municipality, Lithuania. It is located 21 km west of Mažeikiai. Židikai is the seat of Židikai elderate. Židikai is known for being the home of Marija Pečkauskaitė – Šatrijos Ragana, a famous Lithuanian writer (1877–1930) for the last 15 years of her lifetime. Židikai originates from the words Žydi kaip laukas (blooms like a field in English), or from the word Židikis (meaning tough). Židikai was first mentioned in historic records in 1568 AD. From 1614, Židikai was held by the Kražiai Jesuits. In 1659, during the Northern Wars, Swedish forces burnt down Židikai. Between 1918 and 1939, when Lithuania was established as an independent state, Židikai prospered. It was both a center of a parish as well as services and a center of local governance. Židikai population in the interwar period reached nearly 1,000. Before World War II, Židikai had an important Jewish community. According to the census of 1923, there were 893 residents in the shtetl, 799 being Jewish (89%). During the summer of 1941, hundreds of Jews were murdered in mass executions perpetrated by an einsatzgruppen of Germans and Lithuanian collaborators. Economic activity in the village stalled. After the war, during the years of Soviet occupation, Židikai developed similarly to other small towns of Lithuania: in 1952, a hospital was established in a former parsonage; in 1954, a secondary school was established replacing the primary school; and in 1956, Židikai's Culture Center was founded. Židikai's population in 1959 was 429. After the re-establishment of Lithuania in 1990, Židikai became the seat of the Židikai elderate. Currently, the town has three grocery shops, a gymnasium, a dispensary, a library, a music school and a Culture center. Parks were created in 2006 and 2008. In 2007, the President of the Republic of Lithuania approved a new coat of arms of Židikai. On 30 April 2010, a project to renovate the center of the town began. It was financed by the EU and Mažeikiai District Municipality's funds. During the project, the Nepriklausomybės and Turgaus squares as well as the buildings of the Culture center and Židikai elderate were renovated. The project was finished in 2012. Its value was LTL 731,677. The old town of Židikai is an urban monument with its street plan protected. The large Lithuanian company, ORLEN Lietuva has a presence in the Židikai eldership.
