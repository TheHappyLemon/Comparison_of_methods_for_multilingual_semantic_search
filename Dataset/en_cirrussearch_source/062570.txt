Longue paume was on the Summer Olympic Games programme in 1900. Longue paume has generally not been classified as official, although the IOC has never decided which events were "Olympic" and which were not. André Drevon (2000).

This is not correct and no decision has ever been made. No discussion of this item can be found in the account of any Session.
