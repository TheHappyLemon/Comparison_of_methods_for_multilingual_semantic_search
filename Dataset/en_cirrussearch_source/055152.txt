An electronic symbol is a pictogram used to represent various electrical and electronic devices or functions, such as wires, batteries, resistors, and transistors, in a schematic diagram of an electrical or electronic circuit. These symbols are largely standardized internationally today, but may vary from country to country, or engineering discipline, based on traditional conventions. The graphic symbols used for electrical components in circuit diagrams are covered by national and international standards, in particular: IEC 60617 (also known as BS 3939). There is also IEC 61131-3 – for ladder-logic symbols. JIC JIC (Joint Industrial Council) symbols as approved and adopted by the NMTBA (National Machine Tool Builders Association). They have been extracted from the Appendix of the NMTBA Specification EGPl-1967. ANSI Y32.2-1975 (also known as IEEE Std 315-1975 or CSA Z99-1975). IEEE Std 91/91a: graphic symbols for logic functions (used in digital electronics). It is referenced in ANSI Y32.2/IEEE Std 315. Australian Standard AS 1102 (based on a slightly modified version of IEC 60617; withdrawn without replacement with a recommendation to use IEC 60617). The number of standards leads to confusion and errors. Symbols usage is sometimes unique to engineering disciplines, and national or local variations to international standards exist. For example, lighting and power symbols used as part of architectural drawings may be different from symbols for devices used in electronics. Symbols shown are typical examples, not a complete list. The shorthand for ground is GND. Optionally, the triangle in the middle symbol may be filled in. General ground (IEC-style) Signal/low-noise ground (the asterisk is not part of the symbol) Chassis ground (IEC-style) Battery, single-cell Battery, multi-cell Solar cell (photovoltaic cell) DC voltage source Controlled DC voltage source Current source Controlled current source AC voltage source It is very common for potentiometer and rheostat symbols to be used for many types of variable resistors and trimmers. ANSI-style: (a) Resistor, (b) Rheostat, (c) Potentiometer / Trimmer IEC-style: (a) Resistor, (b) Rheostat, (c) Potentiometer / Trimmer Photoresistor (ANSI) Thermistor (ANSI). Use -t for NTC symbol.
