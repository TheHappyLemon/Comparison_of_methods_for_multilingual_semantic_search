Michal Kadlec (born 13 December 1984) is a Czech professional footballer who plays as a defender for Czech club 1. FC Slovácko. He previously played for Sparta Prague, Bayer Leverkusen and Fenerbahçe. Kadlec made his senior debut in 2007. He has scored 8 goals in 67 caps for the Czech Republic, representing them at three (2008, 2012, and 2016) UEFA European Championships. Kadlec was born in 1984 in Vyškov. After his father, Miroslav Kadlec, joined 1. FC Kaiserslautern in 1990, the family moved to Germany in the Kaiserslautern area. Kadlec learned German in kindergarten before he went to school a year later. After his time in Grundschule, he went to the Gymnasium. In 1998, Kadlec's father signed for FK Drnovice and so he returned to the Czech Republic. Kadlec started his professional career in Slovácko and made his debut in a match against Baník Ostrava. In 2005, he joined Sparta Prague. On 14 June 2013 he joined Fenerbahçe for a €4.5 million transfer fee, signing a three-year contract worth €2.1 million per season. On 17 November 2007, Kadlec was called up to the Czech national team for a game against Slovakia, and made his debut in a 3–1 victory (scoring an own goal). He scored his first goal in a win over Scotland on 30 May 2008 (also 3–1). On 16 June 2012, against Poland in the European Championship, Kadlec headed a ball off the line in the dying seconds, preserving the Czechs' spot in the quarter-finals of the tournament. The strike had beaten goalkeeper Petr Čech and appeared to be headed to the inside of the far post; had it been scored then Poland would have ensured a draw, and the Czech Republic would have been eliminated from the tournament. On 11 July 2013, EA Sports announced that Kadlec would feature on the Czech cover of FIFA 14, alongside global cover star Lionel Messi.
