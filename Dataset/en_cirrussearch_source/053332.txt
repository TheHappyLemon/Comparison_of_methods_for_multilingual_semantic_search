Maximilian Schachmann (born 9 January 1994) is a German cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Bora–Hansgrohe. In 2012, he was nominated Germany's 'Cyclist of the Year'. He rode in the 2018 Giro d'Italia, where he won stage 18. Schachmann was born in Berlin and grew up on the outskirts of the city. His school was 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) away from his home and since buses only ran once an hour, he took the bicycle to school, igniting his interest in pursuing cycling as a career. Schachmann turned professional in 2017 with Quick-Step Floors. He had to end his season early after a crash on stage 5 of the Tour de Pologne. In 2018, Schachmann had a break-out season. After an eighth-place finish at the Flèche Wallonne, he went to his first Grand Tour, starting the 2018 Giro d'Italia. Here, he won the stage to Prato Nevoso. He added a bronze medal in the time trial at the UEC European Road Championships to his record as well as a stage win and third overall at the Deutschland Tour. For 2019, Schachmann moved to German squad Bora–Hansgrohe. In March, he won a stage of the Volta a Catalunya. At the Tour of the Basque Country, Schachmann won the stage-one time trial to take the overall lead, before securing two more stage wins on stages 3 and 4. He then competed in the Ardennes classics, placing fifth at both the Amstel Gold Race and the Flèche Wallonne and then claimed third place at Liège–Bastogne–Liège. On 30 June, Schachmann won the German National Road Race Championships, coming in first in a Bora–Hansgrohe 1–2–3 finish during a demanding race in extreme heat of up to 40 °C (104 °F), where only 15 of 190 starters reached the finish line. In July 2019, he was named in the startlist for the 2019 Tour de France. During the stage-13 time trial, he was on his way to post a good time, when he crashed near the end of the course. While he finished the stage, he was later diagnosed with multiple fractures to his hand and had to abandon the Tour. At the beginning of the 2020 season, Schachmann placed second to Remco Evenepoel at the Volta ao Algarve. In March 2020, Schachmann won Paris–Nice in an edition shortened by one stage due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He won the first stage and then held on to an eventual lead of 18 seconds over Tiesj Benoot to become the fifth German winner of the event, and the first since Tony Martin in 2011. Schachmann continued in good form following the return to racing in August, taking third place at Strade Bianche. At Il Lombardia, he suffered an accident when a car entered the race course 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) from the finish. He continued to the finish, where he placed seventh, but fractured his collarbone in the incident. Despite the incident, Schachmann was announced as part of Bora–Hansgrohe's Tour de France octet. In March, he successfully defended his title at Paris–Nice, taking the race lead over Primož Roglič after a crash. He had a strong remainder of the spring season as well, placing third in the Amstel Gold Race and fourth in the Tour de Suisse. In June, he won the German National Road Race Championships. The following month, he placed 10th in the Road race at the Summer Olympics. 2011 2nd Road race, National Junior Road Championships 2012 3rd Time trial, UCI Junior Road World Championships 9th Time trial, UEC European Junior Road Championships 2013 9th Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 2014 2nd Time trial, National Under-23 Road Championships 5th Time trial, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 5th Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 2015 2nd Time trial, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 3rd Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 8th Overall Tour de Berlin 2016 1st Time trial, National Under-23 Road Championships 1st Overall Tour Alsace 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 3 2nd Time trial, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 2nd Overall Tour de Berlin 3rd Overall Le Triptyque des Monts et Châteaux 7th Overall Giro della Valle d'Aosta 1st Stage 3 2017 National Road Championships 4th Time trial 5th Road race 4th Overall Ster ZLM Toer 10th Le Samyn 2018 (3 pro wins) 1st Team time trial, UCI Road World Championships Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 18 Held after Stages 1–5 1st Stage 6 Volta a Catalunya 2nd Classic de l'Ardèche 3rd Time trial, UEC European Road Championships 3rd Overall Deutschland Tour 1st Stage 2 4th Time trial, National Road Championships 4th Overall BinckBank Tour 7th Overall Volta ao Algarve 8th La Flèche Wallonne 2019 (6) 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st GP Industria & Artigianato di Larciano 1st Stage 5 Volta a Catalunya 3rd Liège–Bastogne–Liège 5th Amstel Gold Race 5th La Flèche Wallonne 10th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 1st Points classification 1st Stages 1 (ITT), 3 & 4 10th Overall Tour of California 2020 (2) 1st Overall Paris–Nice 1st Stage 1 2nd Overall Volta ao Algarve 3rd Strade Bianche 7th Giro di Lombardia 9th Road race, UCI Road World Championships Combativity award Stage 13 Tour de France 2021 (2) 1st Road race, National Road Championships 1st Overall Paris–Nice 3rd Amstel Gold Race 4th Overall Tour de Suisse 9th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 10th Road race, Olympic Games 10th La Flèche Wallonne 2022 2nd Grosser Preis des Kantons Aargau 10th Overall Tour de Suisse 2023 (1) 1st Stage 3 Sibiu Cycling Tour National Road Championships 3rd Road race 3rd Time trial 2024 9th GP Miguel Induráin "BORA – hansgrohe".
