Bangabandhu National Stadium (Bengali: বঙ্গবন্ধু জাতীয় স্টেডিয়াম), formerly known as the Dhaka Stadium, is a multipurpose sports arena and the national stadium of Bangladesh. Located in the Motijheel area of Dhaka, it is predominantly used for football matches and serves as the home venue for the Bangladesh national football team. The stadium is well known for hosting a high-profile international friendly between Argentina and Nigeria in 2011. The stadium has undergone multiple renovations.

Despite its reduced capacity of 36,000 after renovation, it remains the largest stadium in Bangladesh. The current name, bestowed to honor Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the nation and also known as "Bangabandhu" or "Friend of Bengal," adds a significant historical touch. The Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka is the only venue in the world to have hosted an inaugural home fixture for two Test nations: Pakistan and Bangladesh.India were the visitors on both occasions: in 1954–55, when Dacca was the capital of East Pakistan, and in 1976–77, when the first unofficial Test match was held between Bangladesh against the touring MCC from England.

After that teams like Deccan Blues from India and MCC toured Bangladesh several times to play against BCCB XI and Bangladesh national team respectively. Alongside cricket, the stadium was also known to host the historic Dhaka League, which was the country's premier football league even before independence of Bangladesh. In the 80s when football's popularity was skyrocketing, the Dhaka Derby attracted thousands of fans into the stadium from all over the country. The stadium regularly hosted the now defunct Aga Khan Gold Cup, which by many is considered to be first organized international competition that involved club teams around Asia. The 1978 AFC Youth Championship marked the first major international tournament hosted by both the stadium and the country.
