Kanopus-V-IK (formerly Kanopus-V 2) is a Russian Earth observation satellite developed by the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Electromechanics and operated by Roscosmos. It was launched on July 14, 2017, designed for monitoring the environment over a large swath of land, and has an expected service life of 5 years. Kanopus-V-IK's mission is to collect data for environmental monitoring and mapping, detection of fires, agricultural planning, and assessing land use. It can also be used to monitor man-made and natural disasters. The satellite uses the Kanopus satellite bus. It was originally built as Kanopus-V 2 but was modified to include an infrared detection capability. Kanopus-V-IK contains several instruments. The Panchromatic Imaging System (PSS) collects black-and-white images for monitoring the environment and covers a ground swath of 23.3 km (14.5 mi). The Multispectral Imaging System (MSS) covers four spectral bands. The green wavelengths are used for vegetation monitoring and the red to near-infrared wavelengths for fire and hotspot detection. The Multispectral Scanner Unit-IK-SR (MSU-IK-SRM) aids in fire detection over a 2,000 km (1,200 mi) swath of the Earth's surface, while having a minimal revisit time due to the satellite's low orbit. Kanopus-V-IK launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 31 on July 14, 2017, at 12:36 local time (06:36 UTC) on board a Soyuz 2 rocket. It was launched with over 70 other satellites in a satellite rideshare mission. It contained 48 CubeSats for Planet Labs. They were launched to a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 512.7 km (318.6 mi), an apogee of 515.2 km (320.1 mi), and an inclination of 97.4°. Graham, William (2017-07-14).
