Quercus serrata, the jolcham oak, (Chinese: 枹栎; pinyin: bāolì, 小楢 (Japanese: konara)) is an East Asian species of tree in the beech family. It is native to China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea. Quercus serrata is a deciduous oak tree reaching a height of 25 metres (82 feet) occupying elevations from 100–2,000 m (330–6,560 ft). The bark is gray or reddish-brown with longitudinal furrows. The leaves are up to 17 centimetres (6+3⁄4 in) long by 9 cm (3+1⁄2 in) wide, leathery, elliptical in shape, with serrated margins; they are densely covered with trichomes when young, becoming glabrous with age. The petioles are short (3 cm). The flowers are pistillate inflorescences from 1.5–3 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄4 in) long, occurring in March to April. The seeds are oval-shaped acorns 1.7–2 cm (5⁄8–3⁄4 in) long and take one year to mature. A cup with trichomes and triangular shaped scales covers 1⁄4 to 1⁄3 of the acorn. The plant frequently attracts stinkbugs which lay their eggs inside them. "Quercus serrata Murray". Tropicos. Missouri Botanical Garden. Retrieved 2018-08-17. "Quercus serrata subsp. serrata".
