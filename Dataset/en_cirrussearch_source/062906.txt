Olajide Olayinka Williams Olatunji was born on 19 June 1993 in London and was raised in Watford, Hertfordshire. His father, Olajide Olatunji, was born in Ibadan, Nigeria. His mother, Olayinka Olatunji (née Atinuke), is from Islington, London. He and his parents are from the Yoruba ethnic group. He was educated at Berkhamsted School in Berkhamsted, where he met future collaborator and Sidemen member Simon Minter. KSI's younger brother, Deji Olatunji, is also a YouTuber and professional boxer. The brothers ranked first and second respectively as the "UK's Most Influential YouTube Creators" by Tubular Labs in 2015. KSI registered his first account on YouTube under the username "JideJunior" in 2008 while in his early teens. He registered his current YouTube account on 24 July 2009 under the name KSI Olajide BT, where he uploaded gaming–commentary videos of the FIFA video game series from his bedroom at his parents' house in Watford. "KSI" stands for Knowledge Strength Integrity. He dropped out of sixth form college to pursue his YouTube career once he was earning steady monthly revenue from his uploads. In an interview in 2014, he recounted asking his teacher whether he should drop-out. His teacher asked how much KSI was making from YouTube, to which KSI answered, "around £1,500 a month", which was more than his teacher earned. His parents initially disapproved, but later became supportive and featured in a number of his videos. KSI later uploaded more vlog-style content and played a variety of games and in 2012, the channel reached a million subscribers. KSI's rise to fame was not without controversy, with him being widely criticised for his self-described 'rape-face', a recurring joke on his channel during 2012 and 2013. He was the centre of a controversy following third-party allegations of sexual harassment of female staff at a Eurogamer event in 2012, that went so far as accusing him of sexually assaulting a spokesmodel Brandy Brewer, despite her tweeting that she consented to the motorboat, writing, "it's called comedy……relax". As a result, Microsoft cut ties with KSI and he was banned from Eurogamer events. KSI subsequently apologised "for any offence the video of 15 months ago may have caused in the short time it was on his YouTube channel, references to it since and subsequently used by other people" and stated his desire to move on from the incident and "be judged on the great content and value he gives to brands and partners, without controversy." In October 2013, KSI signed with Maker Studios' sub-network, Polaris. Since 19 October 2013, KSI has been part of the British YouTube group known as the Sidemen. The group produces online videos, most often consisting of challenges, sketches and video-game commentary, as well as selling exclusive Sidemen merchandise. In 2015, KSI published a biography titled KSI: I Am a Bellend. The book was released on 24 September 2015 in the UK and five days later in the United States, and KSI toured to support the book from its release until 4 October 2015. On 4 August 2017, KSI tweeted that he would be leaving the Sidemen, citing conflicts with fellow member, Ethan Payne.[citation needed] Shortly thereafter, he released a number of diss track videos criticising members of his then-former group, to which most of the members responded back with their own. Later that month, KSI released a video in which he claimed that he was being deported from the United States for receiving an incorrect visa.[citation needed] In November 2017, KSI released a video discussing whether his supposed falling out with the Sidemen was real or fake, saying, "[the drama] wasn't entirely real but wasn't entirely fake either." In 2019, he was ranked second by The Sunday Times in its list of the top 100 UK influencers. In 2020, The Times named KSI to be Britain's biggest influencer.

The event generated 1,300,000 pay-per-view buys, making it one of the largest boxing events in 2023. After the bout had concluded, KSI lashed out at Fury and insisted that the result was a "robbery." Many online and attendees sided with KSI, beveling that he did enough to win the fight, including English sports promoter Eddie Hearn, who was in attendance. On 15 October, the results were changed to a unanimous decision victory to Fury due to judge Rafael Ramos, who had previously scored the bout 57–57 on the scorecard, which was mathematically incorrect. On 19 October, KSI submitted an appeal to the Professional Boxing Association (PBA). On 1 December, the PBA announced on Twitter that they had rejected the appeal, stating there were "no grounds" to overturn the result. Despite the result, KSI's manager Mams Taylor stated that the appeal is still ongoing and that they are moving into the second of three possible stages.
