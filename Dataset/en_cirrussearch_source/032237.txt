Gustav Erik Larsson (born 20 September 1980) is a Swedish former professional road racing cyclist, who rode professionally between 2001 and 2016 for nine different teams. Larsson specialised as a time trialist, winning the Swedish National Time Trial Championships seven times between 2006 and 2015, and won silver medals at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the 2009 World Championships in Mendrisio. On the international scene he represented Team Saxo Bank, and in Sweden he represented Skoghalls CK-Hammarö. Gemla-born Larsson began cycling when he was 14 years and, having shown great talent and dedication, turned pro just 7 years later. Team Fassa Bortolo was his first employer, and when the team shut down in 2005 he moved on to Team Française des Jeux. He rode for one year for Française des Jeux before moving again to the Swedish-Belgian team Unibet.com, which had gained a wild card to the UCI ProTour in 2006. But just as the 2007 season started the team ran into trouble with the Amaury Sport Organisation who made it clear that Unibet.com would not be invited to Paris–Nice or the Tour de France. Other major race organizers followed suit, which resulted in Unibet.com not getting any major invitations. The team shut down shortly thereafter. Team CSC showed interest in Larsson, and he rode for them in 2008. After the 2008 season, it was reported that Larsson had signed with Caisse d'Epargne for 2009, but he continued with Team Saxo Bank. He remained with the team until the end of 2011, when he moved to Vacansoleil–DCM. Larsson left Vacansoleil–DCM at the end of the 2012 season, and joined the new Swiss-based team IAM Cycling team for the 2013 season. Larsson signed for the Cult Energy Pro Cycling team for the 2015 season. In March 2015 Larsson made an attempt on the hour record at a Revolution meeting at Manchester Velodrome. He failed to beat Rohan Dennis' world record of 52.491 kilometres (32.616 miles) but his distance of 50.016 kilometres (31.079 miles) was a new Swedish hour record. He resides in Monaco with his wife Veronica Andrèasson, who also competed as a road racing cyclist. The couple own Vélo Monaco, a cycling holiday organisation. 2001 1st Stage 4b Grand Prix Guillaume Tell 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships 2002 1st Overall Okolo Slovenska 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 5 (ITT) 1st Stage 4 Brandenburg–Rundfahrt 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships 2nd Overall Grand Prix Guillaume Tell 1st Stage 5a 3rd Overall Ringerike GP 1st Stage 1 4th Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 2004 4th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 2006 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 2007 National Road Championships 1st Time trial 3rd Road race 3rd Overall Eneco Tour 3rd Duo Normand (with Víctor Hugo Peña) 5th Overall Tour Down Under 6th Chrono des Nations 7th Overall Tour de Luxembourg 8th Overall Deutschland Tour 2008 2nd Time trial, Olympic Games 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships 2nd Overall Critérium International 4th Overall Danmark Rundt 1st Stage 5 (ITT) 5th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 5th Overall Tour of California 5th Overall Sachsen Tour 6th Overall Tirreno–Adriatico 2009 1st Overall Tour du Poitou Charentes et de la Vienne 1st Stage 3 (ITT) 2nd Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 2nd Overall Tour of Missouri 7th Overall Tour de Luxembourg 10th Japan Cup 2010 National Road Championships 1st Time trial 2nd Road race 1st Overall Tour du Limousin 1st Stage 2 (ITT) 1st Stage 21 (ITT) Giro d'Italia 1st Stage 1 (ITT) Vuelta a la Comunidad de Madrid 4th Chrono des Nations 7th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 10th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 2011 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 2nd Chrono des Nations 2012 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Stage 1 (ITT) Paris–Nice 8th Chrono des Nations 2013 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 2nd Chrono des Nations 5th Overall Tour du Poitou-Charentes 8th Overall Tour Méditerranéen 9th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 2014 4th Overall Tour of Norway 2015 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 9th Overall Bayern–Rundfahrt 9th Overall Tour of Norway 2016 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships "Vacansoleil snap up Larsson".
