The Uexküll family (also Üxküll or Yxkull) is the name of an old and distinguished Baltic-German noble family, which derived its name from the town of Uexküll, today in Latvia. Uexküll was originally a Bremen noble family von Bardewisch, first appeared in written documents on 26 July 1229, whose lineage can be traced to several places, the earliest originating in Stedingen, and later the Baltic States, Sweden, Württemberg, and Baden. After obtaining domain Meyendorff, the branch of Uexkülls family was formed in the third quarter of the 15th century and since then it became known as Meyendorff von Uexküll. The family was also part of the German nobility and on 9 October 1790 they were awarded with the title of Imperial Count by Leopold II. The Bardewisch coat of arms displays two upward facing battle axes, in blue and black. The helmet appears with closed blue-silver covers. The Uexküll coat of arms displays a victorious red lion in a golden backdrop. On the two helmets are red-golden covers facing silver sickles with red shanks. These are adorned with natural peacock feathers. Since 1475 the coat of arms has shown the shields of both the Bardewisch and Uexküll. This is achieved by placing the two side by side with the Uexküll shield on the left and the Bardewisch shield to the right. The helmet, adorned with peacock feathers and centered between two sickles, is split in two, the left of the helmet displaying the red and gold of Uexküll, and the right the colours of Bardewisch.
