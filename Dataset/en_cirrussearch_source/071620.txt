SpaceX Crew-8 is the eighth crewed operational NASA Commercial Crew flight and the 13th overall crewed orbital flight of a Crew Dragon spacecraft. The mission launched on 4 March 2024. The Crew-8 mission transports four crew members to the International Space Station (ISS). Three NASA astronauts, Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, and Jeanette Epps, and one Roscosmos cosmonaut, Alexander Grebenkin, were assigned to the mission. Jeanette Epps was previously assigned to Boeing Starliner missions. The eighth SpaceX operational mission in the Commercial Crew Program launched at 3:53 UTC on 4 March 2024. SpaceX sent the 50th astronaut on this Crew Dragon launch. Following delays due to unfavorable weather conditions in offshore areas of the flight path, the first launch attempt was scrubbed at T−03:25:38 hours due to an elevated ascent winds (times are UTC).
