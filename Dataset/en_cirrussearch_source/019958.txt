In the 19th century, during the rule of the noble Auersperg family, the village of Slatiňany economically developed. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it became an industrial centre with sugar factory, distillery and fertilizer factory. In 1971, it was promoted to a town. The main landmark is the Slatiňany Castle with a 16 ha (40-acre) large English park. it was originally a neo-Gothic fortress, rebuilt into a Renaissance castle. During the rule of the Auersperg family after 1746, the castle became the administrative centre of the estate and was converted into a comfortable summer residence with a park. The castle and park create a very valuable set of monuments, protected as a national cultural monument. Among the most valuable elements are the baroque and romantic interiors and the castle stud farm, built in 1894–1898. This former stud farm now houses the Museum of Kladruber. The park is also decorated with Kočičí hrádek, which is 1:5 scale miniature of a castle.
