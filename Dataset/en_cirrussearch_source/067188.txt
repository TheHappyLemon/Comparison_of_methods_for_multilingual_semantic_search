Following undocking at 19:46 UTC on 1 September 2008, it spent a week in free-flight conducting experiments for the Plazma-Progress programme. It was deorbited on 8 September 2008, with the deorbit burn beginning at 20:47 UTC. The spacecraft burned up in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean, with any remaining debris landing in the ocean at around 21:33 UTC. Progress M-64 carried 3,100 kilograms (6,800 lb) of cargo to the International Space Station. 1,292 kilograms (2,848 lb) of this was dry cargo, including food for the crew, equipment for conducting scientific research, and a replacement Sokol KV-2 spacesuit for Sergey Volkov, as his original suit had been damaged. It also carried a docking target for attaching the MRM-2 module to the zenith port of the Zvezda module. In addition to dry cargo, it carried 1,230 kilograms (2,710 lb) of fuel for reboosting and refuelling the ISS, 29 kilograms (64 lb) of oxygen and 21 kilograms (46 lb) of air for the crew to breathe, and 420 kilograms (930 lb) of water.
