In January 2013, NBC green-lit the production of a pilot episode. Scenes of Ballard High School were filmed at Northside College Prep in Chicago. On May 12, 2013, the series was placed on the network's 2013–14 schedule. It premiered on March 16, 2014. On November 1, 2013, after filming was completed for the sixth episode, production of the series was put on an unscheduled, week-long hiatus. The pause in production was attributed to fears that subsequent episodes were veering too far away from the tone of the pilot, which received very positive early reviews. The break was supposed to be used to give writers time to re-work scripts and to re-shoot certain scenes for previously finished episodes. Filming later resumed. The series was released on DVD in December 2014 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, exclusively through Amazon as a "manufactured on demand" DVD-R set. The DVD contained all 13 episodes. Crisis scored 63 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 28 "generally favorable" reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it was given a score of 61% based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8 out of 10. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times gave it a positive review. Stanley wrote: "The pilot is terrific" and suggested that the series could be a new "24" but that "a series centered on a busload of kidnapped students and their fate, dragged out week after week, could easily try viewers' patience." Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter gave it a negative review, calling it "as flat as any recent thriller on network television--actually more so. There’s barely an ounce of believability in it. The casting seems woeful and the acting isn’t going to get you to the second hour." Rackl, Lori (March 11, 2014). "Chicago poses as D.C. in NBC's intriguing 'Crisis'". Chicago Sun-Times.
