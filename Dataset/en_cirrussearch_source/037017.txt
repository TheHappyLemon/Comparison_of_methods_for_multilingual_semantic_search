The 2017 route was 291 km (181 mi) long, running from the Via della Chiesa Rossa in Milan to the traditional finish on Sanremo's Via Roma. The final part of the race included the climbs of the Cipressa and the Poggio di San Remo, which usually prove decisive for the race outcome. Also on the route, the riders also had to tackle the 35 km (22 mi) climb of the Passo dello Turchino, although it was not considered to be a key point in the race. After the Turchino, the route followed the Aurelia road along the coast from Genoa all the way to the finish in Sanremo. With a little over 50 km (31 mi) left to go, the first of the coastal climbs started with the Capo Mele, the Capo Cervo and the Capo Berta, before meeting the final two climbs leading to the finish.
