The cape is located on the southwestern tip of the Azuero Peninsula directly on the Pacific Ocean about 15 km south of Arenas and about 70 km west of Tonosi and roughly 350 km southwest of Panama City. Punta Mariato is uninhabited and covered by mangrove and rainforest and is part of the 33 400 hectare (8255 acres) large nature reserve Parque nacional Cerro Hoya (Cerro Hoya National Park). The reserve which extends into neighbouring Los Santos Province is classified as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO.

Parque nacional Cerro Hoya was established on October 2, 1984, and is home of most of the remaining jungle habitat in the Azuero region and is also habitat for a number of endangered species.
