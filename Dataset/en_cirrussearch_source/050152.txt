Diego Javier Llorente Ríos (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈdjeɣo ʎoˈɾente ˈri.os]; born 16 August 1993) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Serie A club Roma, on loan from EFL Championship club Leeds United, and the Spain national team. Having been developed at Real Madrid, who also loaned him twice to clubs in La Liga, he signed with Real Sociedad in June 2017. Three years later, he joined Leeds United. Llorente made his full debut for Spain in 2016. He was part of the squad at Euro 2020. Born in Madrid, Llorente joined Real Madrid's youth system in July 2002, one month shy of his ninth birthday. In the 2012–13 season he made his senior debut, appearing with the C team in a 1–1 away draw against Caudal Deportivo in the Segunda División B. On 24 March 2013, Llorente made his first appearance with Real Madrid Castilla, coming on as a substitute for injured Iván González in an eventual 4–0 home win over Córdoba CF. On 11 May, he was an unused bench player for the main squad in a La Liga match at RCD Espanyol, but finally made his debut in the competition on 1 June, replacing Álvaro Arbeloa for the dying minutes of the last game of the campaign, at home against CA Osasuna. On 14 July 2015, Llorente moved to neighbouring Rayo Vallecano in a season-long loan deal. He scored his first goal in the top flight on 3 January 2016, the first in a 2–2 home draw against Real Sociedad, and was an undisputed starter as his team eventually suffered relegation as third from bottom. Llorente was loaned to Málaga CF also in the top tier on 8 July 2016. On 26 June 2017, Llorente signed a five-year contract with Real Sociedad. In his league debut, on 10 September, he contributed one goal to a 4–2 away win against Deportivo de La Coruña after replacing Iñigo Martínez midway through the second half. Four days later, in his very first appearance in European competition, he started and scored twice in a 4–0 home defeat of Rosenborg BK in the group stage of the UEFA Europa League. Leeds United announced the signing of Llorente on a four-year deal on 24 September 2020, for a reported fee of £18 million. He made his Premier League debut on 5 December, coming on for the injured Robin Koch in the ninth minute of an eventual 3–1 away loss to rivals Chelsea. He scored his first league goal on 19 April 2021, heading home a cross from Jack Harrison in a 1–1 home draw against Liverpool. On 31 January 2023, Llorente joined Serie A club AS Roma on loan until 30 June with an option to buy. He made his debut in the competition four days later, replacing Nicola Zalewski in injury time of the 2–0 home victory over Empoli FC. Also as a late substitute, he appeared in the Europa League final against Sevilla FC on 31 May, a 4–1 penalty shootout loss in Budapest. Llorente returned to the Stadio Olimpico for the 2023–24 season, again on loan. Llorente was called up to the Spain national team by manager Vicente del Bosque in May 2016, for a friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina. He made his debut later that month, replacing Cesc Fàbregas in the 3–1 win in Switzerland. On 24 May 2021, Llorente was included in Luis Enrique's 24-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020. A right-footed player who possesses good positioning and is strong in the air, Llorente can operate as a central defender or defensive midfielder.
