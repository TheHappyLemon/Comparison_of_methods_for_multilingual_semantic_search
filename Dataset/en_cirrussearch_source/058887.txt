Jocelyn Angloma (born 7 August 1965) is a Guadeloupean football manager and former professional player who played as a defender. Born in Guadeloupe, he represented both the France and Guadeloupe national teams. He is the head coach of the Guadeloupe national team. Angloma began his professional football career in France, and was a member of the Marseille team which won the 1992–93 UEFA Champions League. He played more than 400 games in European first divisions, including spells in Italy, and 120 appearances with Valencia in Spain, where he played until his retirement in 2002. He played in the UEFA Champions League Finals of 2000 and 2001 for the Spanish club, but was on the losing side on both occasions. Angloma played 37 times for France between 1990 and 1996, scoring one goal. Angloma was part of the squad at Euro 92 and Euro 96. In 2006, Angloma came out of retirement to play for his native région, Guadeloupe, and help them qualify for the 2007 Caribbean Nations Cup. He was allowed to represent Guadeloupe because Guadeloupe is not a FIFA member and only participates in regional competitions. After his return from retirement, Angloma moved from his natural position as a right-back and played as a midfield playmaker for Guadeloupe. In December 2017, he was appointed Guadeloupe's coach. Jocelyn Angloma's son Johan plays in several youth teams of Guadeloupe and was member of the Guadeloupe under-14 national football team at the Coupe National Under-14 2008.
