Angers Sporting Club de l'Ouest, commonly referred to as Angers SCO or simply Angers (French pronunciation: [ɑ̃ʒe]), is a French professional football club based in Angers in Pays de la Loire in western France. The club was founded in 1919 and plays in Ligue 2, the second division of Football in France. It plays its home matches at the Stade Raymond Kopa. The club has played 23 seasons in the French top flight. The team was founded in 1919, the same year the FFF was founded. During the team's history, it has bounced between the top two tiers on multiple occasions. However, it did spend time in the third tier on several occasions; the 2006–07 season was its last season in the third tier. The first season that Angers debuted in the French second division was in 1945. During this season, Angers SCO was placed in the North group; at that time, the second division was split into two groups, the North and South. Angers finished third, being seven points short of Stade Français, which was promoted to the first division. In the 2014–15 Ligue 2 season, the team achieved promotion after a long time being in the lower division. During the 2015–16 Ligue 1 season, SCO placed ninth in the final standings. In its opening league match against Montpellier, Angers won the match 2–0. On 28 May 2017 Angers played in the 2017 Coupe de France final against Paris Saint-Germain. Angers lost the match 1–0 courtesy of 91st minute own goal. At the end of the 2017–18 Ligue 1 season, Angers finished 14th on the table and Cameroon striker Karl Toko Ekambi finished with an impressive 17 goals in the competition. In the 2018–19 Ligue 1 season, Angers finished in a respectable 13th position on the table. On 8 June 2020, Angers broke their own transfer fee record by signing Paul Bernardoni from Bordeaux, in a deal worth 8 million euros. On 30 April 2021 Angers, along with Paris FC, were handed a transfer ban by FIFA for violation of regulations regarding relay transfers in August 2020. The ban was effective for the summer 2021 transfer window. On 27 April 2023, Angers received a two-window transfer ban from FIFA due to a dispute with Tunisian club ES Tunis over the transfer of Ilyes Chetti. Angers communicated their intent to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). In the 2022–23 Ligue 1 season, Angers suffered relegation with five matches to spare, returning to the second tier after eight years in the top flight.
