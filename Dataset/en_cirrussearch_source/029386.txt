Most nation states have an anthem, defined as "a song, as of praise, devotion, or patriotism"; most anthems are either marches or hymns in style. A song or hymn can become a national anthem under the state's constitution, by a law enacted by its legislature, or simply by tradition. A royal anthem is a patriotic song similar to a national anthem, but it specifically praises or prays for a monarch or royal dynasty. Such anthems are usually performed at public appearances by the monarch or during other events of royal importance. Some states use their royal anthem as the national anthem, such as the state anthem of Jordan. There are multiple claimants to the position of oldest national anthem. Among the national anthems, the first to be composed was the Dutch national anthem, the "Wilhelmus", which was written between 1568 and 1572. This has both Dutch and English language versions and is unusual in being an acrostic in both languages. The Japanese anthem, "Kimigayo", employs the oldest lyrics of any national anthem, taking its words from the "Kokin Wakashū", which was first published in 905, yet these words were not set to music until 1880. The first anthem to be officially adopted as such was the Spanish anthem "La Marcha Real", in 1770; its origins remain unclear; it is suggested that it has 16th century Venetian origins, or even that it was composed by king Frederick the Great himself; it is also one of the few national anthems that has never had official lyrics. Anthems became increasingly popular among European states in the 18th century. For example, the British national anthem "God Save the King" was first performed in 1745. The French anthem "La Marseillaise" was written half a century later in 1792, and adopted in 1795. National anthems are usually written in the most common language of the state, whether de facto or official. States with multiple national languages may offer several versions of their anthem. For instance, Switzerland's national anthem has different lyrics for each of the country's four official languages: French, German, Italian, and Romansh. One of New Zealand's two national anthems is commonly sung with the first verse in Māori ("Aotearoa") and the second in English ("God Defend New Zealand"). The tune is the same but the lyrics have different meanings. South Africa's national anthem is unique in that it is two different songs put together with five of the country's eleven official languages being used, in which each language comprises a stanza.

"God Save the King" is the royal anthem of Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, Jamaica, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, the Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu, and one of New Zealand's two national anthems. "My Belarusy" was originally adopted by the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. "Lijepa naša domovino" was originally adopted by the Socialist Republic of Croatia. "Hymn to Liberty" or "Hymn to Freedom" is the national anthem of both Cyprus and Greece. By the power of the Constitution of Cyprus, the Turkish national anthem "İstiklâl Marşı" was used when a Turkish Cypriot representative was present. The practice lasted up to 1963. Originally adopted by Czechoslovakia as a part of its hymn in 1918 (together with Slovak "Nad Tatrou sa blýska"), and later in 1993 by the Czech Republic (already without the Slovak part). Both Danish anthems have equal status. First performed in 1848. National anthem status gained through convention after independence in 1917. Only the third stanza is the official national anthem. Uses the same melody as "God Save the King" This refers to "God Defend New Zealand", not "God Save the King". Until the early 20th century, "Sønner av Norge" was the most recognised national anthem of Norway. Also "Norges Skaal" and "Mitt lille land" have at times been described as national anthems. Norway's unofficial royal anthem is "Kongesangen". "Ja, vi elsker dette landet" was first performed in 1864, but only gradually came to replace the older national anthem "Sønner av Norge" as de facto national anthem. It was adopted as the official national anthem 11 December 2019. Also known by its incipit: "Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła, kiedy my żyjemy" ("Poland Is Not Yet Lost, So long as we still live"). "Zdravljica" was originally adopted by the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. Only the seventh stanza of the song is the national anthem. The "National Anthem of South Africa" is a hybrid of "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika" ("God Bless Africa") and "Die Stem van Suid-Afrika" ("The Call of South Africa"). Declared official "Honor March" by Charles III in 1770, abolished 1820-1823, adopted as official anthem under Isabel II (r. 1833–1868), co-official during 1873-1874 and again abolished 1931-1939. Re-introduced in 1939. Sweden's royal anthem is "Kungssången". Thailand's royal anthem is "Phleng Sansoen Phra Barami". Royal anthem in a number of Commonwealth realms, including the United Kingdom, but no official status as national anthem. Anthems of the Countries of the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), sometimes described as "national anthems", are not listed here. As non-sovereign states, they are listed at List of regional anthems. This list is for those who have declared independence and are partially recognized. "National Banner Song" is used as the alternate state anthem for Taiwan at international sporting events such as the Olympic Games and World Baseball Classic. The official state name of Taiwan is the "Republic of China". General Hang, Xing (2003). Encyclopedia of National Anthems. The Scarecrow Press. ISBN 978-0-8108-4847-4. Minahan, James B. (2009).
