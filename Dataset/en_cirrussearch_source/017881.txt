Progress M-18M (Russian: Прогресс М-18М), identified by NASA as Progress 50P, is a Progress spacecraft used by Roskosmos to resupply the International Space Station during 2013. Progress M-18M was sent on a four-orbit rendezvous profile that was already demonstrated by the Progress M-16M and Progress M-17M spacecraft in 2012. The spacecraft was launched on time at 14:41:46 UTC on 11 February 2013 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Progress M-18M docked with the Pirs at 20:35 UTC less than six hours after the launch. The successful docking climaxed the third successful Same-Day-Rendezvous in the International Space Station history. Progress M-18M delivered about 346 kilograms (763 lb) of propellant, 50 kilograms (110 lb) of oxygen and air, 420 kilograms (930 lb) of water and about 1,368 kilograms (3,016 lb) of spare parts, science gear and other supplies (dry cargo) to the Space Station. Progress M-18M undocked from the ISS on 25 July 2013. The re-entry procedure started around 23:53 UTC, on 25 July 2013. The destruction occurred at 00:42 UTC, on 26 July 2013 in the Pacific Ocean.
