The Ferencváros Stadion, also known as the Groupama Aréna for sponsorship purposes, is a multi-purpose stadium in Ferencváros, Budapest, Hungary and the home of Ferencvárosi TC. With a capacity of 22,000, it was for a time the largest stadium in Hungary (between the demolition of the larger Ferenc Puskás Stadium in 2017 and the opening of the Puskás Aréna in November 2019). It was built on the site of the former Flórián Albert Stadium, the club's previous home, which was demolished in 2013. The French insurance group Groupama purchased the naming rights to the stadium. However, the name cannot be used when hosting FIFA and UEFA events, since these governing bodies have policies forbidding corporate sponsorship from companies that are not official tournament partners. Since 1911, Ferencváros had played their home games at Stadion Albert Flórián, originally named Üllői úti Stadion. The stadium had had a major upgrade from 1971 to 1974, and in the 21st century the club desired a stadium with an expanded capacity. Reconstruction of Stadion Albert Flórián was rejected for financial reasons, and plans to demolish the stadium and replace it with an entirely new structure were presented at a press conference in April 2012 by Gábor Kubatov, the president of Ferencváros. The proposed capacity of 22,600 would make it the second biggest stadium in Hungary. The new stadium would be reorientated 90° and closer to Gyáli út, with a pitch 10 cm below ground level. Corporate hospitality, a restaurant, shop and museum were all planned, along with expanded changing facilities. Market építő Zrt won the tender to construct the stadium, with a projected cost of 13.5 billion Ft. Construction started on 28 March 2013, with an estimated completion time of autumn 2014. On 24 May 2013, Balázs Fürjes, MP of the Hungarian Parliament and person responsible for the investment, announced that the stadium would be finished on time. The construction of the new stadium is expected to be completed by the fall of 2014. In 2013 there will be 5,4 billion HUF available for the project and 8,1 billion HUF in 2014. Mihály Varga, minister of national economy of Hungary, said that the sale of the estate, which will be gained by rotating the stadium by 90°, will cover the expenses of the stadium. If the construction is not completed on time, the constructor company (Market Épitő Zrt.) will have to pay 65 million HUF daily. Melinda Várkonyi said that an 82-millimetre grenade was found at the building site of the new stadium. Allegedly the shell originates from a Soviet grenade launcher from the Second World War. On 3 October 2013, Balázs Fürjes, MP of the Hungarian Parliament, said that the construction of the stadium is of record speed. It was quite sure that the club could start the 2014–15 Hungarian League season in the new stadium. The Ferencváros club centre was opened, where the fans of the club can take a look at the plans of the new stadium or a 3D film can be watched about the future stadium. Balázs Fürjes also pointed out that the new stadium will be a multi-purpose stadium where concerts, conferences, cultural events can be held apart from association football matches. He also mentioned that the elements of the old Albert stadium will be used for the construction of the new stadium. Therefore, it is a green investment for two reasons: for the colours of the club, and for the eco-friendly construction. The steel structure, which weighs 2800 tons, was made in Kecskemét while the concrete structure, which is 25,000 cubic metres, was made in Dunaújváros. The construction of the new stadium gives jobs for almost 2000 blue-collar workers. On 17 January 2014, new photos about the new stadium were released on the Facebook site of the Albert Stadium. On 18 April 2014, it was announced that a 3-metre-tall statue of Ferencváros Ballon d'Or winner Flórián Albert will be erected in front of the main entrance. Sándor Kligl, sculptor and artist, was asked to make the bronze statue. The artist also said that he saw playing the Ferencváros legend live and it was worth going to the stadium just because of him. He was commissioned with many different tasks but this has been the most special one in his life. Junior Flórián Albert said that it was a moving moment to look at his father statue. In April 2014, Lagardère Unlimited Stadium Solutions, the dedicated agency for stadia and arena operations owned by Lagardère Unlimited, signed a long-term naming right contract with and French insurer Groupama. The deal includes the operation, management and marketing of the new arena. Lagardère Unlimited Stadium Solutions is currently involved in consulting, operations and marketing services in several stadiums worldwide, including Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt, Imtech Arena in Hamburg and two stadiums in Brazil. On 2 July 2014, it was announced that the name of the new stadium would be the Groupama Arena. On 7 July 2014, it was announced that the first kick would be executed by Ferencváros legend, Ferenc Rudas. It was revealed that one of the halls will be named after former Ferencváros and Barcelona legend László Kubala who played for Ferencváros between 1945 and 1946 and scored 33 goals in 50 matches. On 4 August 2014, the first unofficial match was played at the stadium in front of 6,500 spectators. Ferencváros old-boys team including Szeiler, Dzurják, Lipcsei, Telek, and Lisztes hosted their arch-rival Újpest old-boys including Kovács, Szlezák, Fehér, Egressy, and Mészöly. The final result was 6–5 to Újpest. The tickets for free those supporters who purchased season tickets before the match and for the workers and their relatives who contributed to the construction of the new stadium. On 10 August 2014, Ferencváros played the opening match against Chelsea F.C. The first goal at the new stadium was scored by Ferencváros Legened, Zoltán Gera in the 17th minute. However, in the second half Ramires (51st minute) and Fàbregas scored (81st minute) which resulted the 2–1 defeat at the new stadium for the home side. On 10 August 2014, around 2,500 spectators belonging to the B Közép organised an alternative match at the stadium of BKV Előre SC in protest against the high entrance fees earmarked by the leadership of Ferencváros, the entrance security checks, and that Chelsea would play the opening match against Ferencváros and not the Austrian archrival Rapid Wien. The two teams included the supporters of Ferencváros and Rapid Wien. On 24 August 2014, the first Hungarian League match was played at the stadium. Ferencváros beat Nyíregyháza 3–1. The first goal was scored by Busai in the 13th minute. On 7 September 2014, Hungary played their first match at the stadium against Northern Ireland. The UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier ended with a 2–1 away victory. On 14 November 2014, Hungary won their first match at the new stadium by beating Finland 1–0 thanks to Gera's 84th-minute goal in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier.
