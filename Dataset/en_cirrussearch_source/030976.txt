The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone. Villages of Milotičky, Popelištná, Těchoraz and Zmišovice are administrative parts of Červená Řečice. The name řečice is derived from řeka (i.e. "river"), meaning "small river". In the 14th century it was called Biskupská Řečice ("Bishop's Řečice"), since 1559 it has been named Červená Řečice ("Red Řečice"). Červená Řečice is located about 9 kilometres (6 mi) north of Pelhřimov and 31 km (19 mi) northwest of Jihlava. It lies in the Křemešník Highlands. It lies on the right banks of the Trnava river and on the shores of the Trnávka Reservoir. The first written mention of Řečice is from 1279. It was the centre of a large manor belonging to Prague's bishops and, later, archbishops. Its next owners were Ladislaus the Posthumous, Trčka of Lípa family, and lords of Stráž. From 1612 until the abolishment of serfdom in 1850, it was owned by the lords of Říčany. The Červená Řečice Castle was rebuilt in the Renaissance style in the 16th century. The castle complex is a valuable example of Czech Renaissance. The façade is decorated by sgraffiti. The original moat is partially preserved.
