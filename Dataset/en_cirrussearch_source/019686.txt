The A5 highway is a highway in Lithuania (Magistralinis kelias). It runs from Kaunas to the Polish border, toward Suwałki and ultimately Warsaw. The length of the road is 97.86 km (60.81 mi). A section of the A5 highway - Kaunas-Marijampolė, has been upgraded to a motorway, accessed only via grade-separated junctions. It is the first motorway built after Lithuania entered the European Union in 2004. The remainder of the road is being upgraded to motorway specifications. It will connect Kaunas with expressway S61 in Poland. The road will be only motorway connection between the Lithuanian motorway network and the rest of the European motorway network. The entire reconstruction up to the polish border is due to be completed by 2025. Most of the A5 highway is coded Via Baltica in the European route system. The E67 highway ultimately connects Prague with Tallinn/Helsinki. Kaunas Marijampolė Kalvarija v t e v t e
