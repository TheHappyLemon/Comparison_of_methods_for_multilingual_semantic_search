Kalush Orchestra is a Ukrainian folk-hip hop group founded in 2021 as a side project of KALUSH, performing hip-hop music in the Ukrainian language. They represented Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 with the song "Stefania" and went on to win the competition, securing Ukraine's third Eurovision win. Kalush Orchestra combines elements of Ukrainian folk music with modern production, hip-hop dance, and Ukrainian-language rap. Kalush Orchestra was created in 2021 as a group of six musicians, as well as a side project of rap group KALUSH, which was founded in 2019. The name comes from the city of Kalush¬†‚Äì frontman Oleh Psiuk's hometown in the Ivano-Frankivsk region. On 12 February 2022, Kalush Orchestra competed to represent Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 in Turin, Italy with the song "Stefania". In the final of the national selection Vidbir, they placed second with 14 points (six from the jury and eight from the audience). Alina Pash received the highest score of the jury - 8 points. The audience rated her performance 7 points. These results ultimately brought the singer the first place in the rating table. Despite coming in second place, the band were offered the chance to represent Ukraine at Eurovision, after Pash withdrew her candidacy due to controversy regarding her travel history in Crimea. On 22 February, Kalush Orchestra accepted the offer. On the same day, the Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne published the official voting results of Vidbir 2022, confirming that Pash had been correctly chosen as the winner, contrary to Psiuk's claims. The group won the Eurovision final on 14 May with 631 points, securing Ukraine's third Eurovision victory. "Stefania" became the first song with rap lyrics to win the contest, as well as the winning song with the highest number of televote points in the history of the contest. The group later announced that they would put their Eurovision trophy up for auction to raise money for the Ukrainian armed forces. The trophy was sold for US$900,000, with proceeds earmarked for purchase of combat drones for Ukraine's military. The group subsequently embarked on a promotional tour across Europe and North America to raise awareness and donations for Ukrainian efforts in combating the Russian invasion. In November 2022, the group performed "Oy na hori" and "Stefania" at the 2022 MTV Europe Music Awards. On 12 July 2023, the group released "Chase" and "Human" as part of the Spotify Singles project.

In June 2023, Kalush Orchestra presented their third English-language track title "In the Fire". In September 2023, the band released the first track "Vogon' goryt'", which means "the fire is burning" without the participation of Oleh Psiuk. The release was dedicated to an experimental mini-tour that took place in December 2023. In late September and early October 2023, the band held its first tour of Ukraine. The tour consisted of 12 concerts at which money was traditionally raised to help Ukraine. In November 2023, the band toured North America for the third time.
