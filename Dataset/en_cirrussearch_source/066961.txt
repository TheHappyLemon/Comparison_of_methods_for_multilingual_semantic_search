Jack McBain (born January 6, 2000) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player for Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted 63rd overall by the Minnesota Wild in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. McBain played his minor hockey for the Don Mills Flyers of the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL). Despite being drafted in the 1st round of the Ontario Hockey League's Priority Selection by the Barrie Colts, McBain opted to play junior hockey for the Toronto Jr. Canadiens of the Ontario Junior Hockey League (OJHL) to maintain his eligibility in the NCAA. After winning the OJHL's Top Prospect Award, McBain was drafted 63rd overall by the Minnesota Wild in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. After the draft, he committed to Boston College and played with them for four seasons. Following the completion of McBain's senior season with the Eagles and the conclusion of his collegiate career, McBain informed the Wild that he did not intend to sign a contract with the club. Faced with the prospect of losing McBain's rights for nothing, as graduating collegiate players become unrestricted free agents in August annually, and with multiple NHL teams expressing interest in McBain's services, the Wild began exploring trade opportunities for his signing rights. On March 20, 2022, McBain's NHL rights were traded by Minnesota to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for a 2022 second-round draft pick. McBain was signed to an entry-level contract by the Coyotes a day after he was traded. McBain made his NHL debut on April 12, 2022 against the New Jersey Devils. He recorded his first point three games later, an assist on a goal by teammate Nick Ritchie, in a 9–1 loss to the Calgary Flames on April 16. On December 29, 2022, McBain recorded his first multi goal and point game, scoring two goals in a 6-3 victory against the Toronto Maple Leafs. At the conclusion of McBain's first professional contract following the 2022–23 season, McBain (a restricted free agent) and the Coyotes reached an impasse on a contract extension. Unable to agree on a contract extension, McBain and the team filed to have an independent arbitrator settle on a new contract; McBain filed seeking a 1 year, $2.25 million contract, while the team filed with an offer of a 2 year deal worth an average annual value of $1.2 million a season. On July 30, 2023, hours before the case was set to be heard by an arbitrator, McBain and the Coyotes agreed to a 2-year, $3.2 million contract worth an average of $1.6 million a season. In January 2022, McBain was selected to play for Team Canada at the 2022 Winter Olympics. McBain is the son of former NHL player Andrew McBain. He grew up in The Beaches neighbourhood of Toronto.
