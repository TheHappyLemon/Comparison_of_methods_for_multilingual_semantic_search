Balāde par gulbi (English: Ballad about a Swan) is a song by Latvian Rock band Pērkons, written by Māris Melgalvis (lyrics) and Juris Kulakovs (music) in 1979 and recorded in 1983. Written while Latvia was still part of USSR, it is noted for its anti-soviet subtext. The opening part of the song deals with a crow with no sense of humor sitting on a fresh grave and forcing her opinion on everyone. However, after some time, the crow begins to sense something odd about the grave and relives her own tragedy. It is not until the end, when the crow has had enough of the bitter silence, that she realizes what has happened to her and that the crow is "the woman she loves". Most of the song dwells on the stupidity of killing a swan, but in the end resolves that the swan is so red that one cannot help killing it (consider that in the early 1980s soviet leaders were dying one after another and were usually mourned by broadcasting Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake). Kārna vārna Uz slapa kapa Man savu patiesību ķērc Vai tiešām viņa neattapa ka viss tas - tikai joka pēc Ak vai cik stulbi Ir nosist gulbi Bet stulbāk vēl ja vēlāk žēl Tad ir tik velnišķīgi stulbi—ik rietā sarkans gulbis kvēl Tik stulbi kvēl Ka jāsit vēl Translation: A skinny crow On a wet grave Croaking her truth to me Didn't she really realize that it all is just for fun? Oh, how stupid It is to beat a swan to death But even more stupid if you regret it later It is so devilishly stupid—in each sunset a red swan glows Glows so stupidly That one has to beat it again Balāde par gulbi 30 second sample from Pērkons' "Balāde par gulbi" Problems playing this file?
