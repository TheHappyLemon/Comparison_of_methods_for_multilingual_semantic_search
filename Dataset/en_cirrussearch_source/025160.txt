This list records the monarchs of Sweden, from the late Viking Age to the present day. Sweden has continuously been a monarchy since the country's consolidation in the Viking Age and early Middle Ages, for over a thousand years. The incumbent royal dynasty of Sweden is the House of Bernadotte, established on the throne in 1818. There were organized political structures in Sweden before the kingdom was unified; based on archaelogical evidence, early tribal societies are believed to have transitioned into organized chiefdoms in the first few centuries AD, perhaps spurred by contacts with the Roman Empire and the rest of Europe. In the period AD 500–800, Scandinavian societies began adopting cultural elements from the newly established Germanic kingdoms in Europe, transitioning further into petty kingdoms. Archaeological evidence suggests that were numerous petty kingdoms throughout modern-day Sweden. Foreign sources and later native sources describe the later medieval kingdom as being composed of two main regions: Svealand (particularly around Lake Mälaren) and Götaland. Sources from as early as the Roman author Tacitus (c. 56–126) mention two main peoples or tribes in modern Sweden: the Svear (Swedes) and Götar (Geats); the Svear are mentioned in more foreign sources than the Götar, credited with military activities at sea. The securely attested Swedish rulers in the Viking Age, predecessors of the later line of Swedish kings, ruled from the religious and political center of Old Uppsala; though its history before the Viking Age is poorly attested, it is probable that Old Uppsala had been a political and religious center since the Migration Period. The earliest historically attested Swedish rulers are 9th-century petty kings from the Vita Ansgarii, an account written c. 870 by Rimbert partly concerning Saint Ansgar's visit to Svealand. Some kings of Old Uppsala are also mentioned in later Icelandic texts and sagas. The line of legendary Swedish kings from Icelandic tradition, called sagokungar in Swedish, are not generally treated as historical figures, though some may be based on actual chieftains or petty kings. Some later king-lists deliberately extended the sequence of kings for nationalistic purposes, such as Johannes Magnus's Historia de omnibus Gothorum Sueonumque regibus (1554); supposed ancient kings mentioned in such sources are clearly fictional. The petty kingdoms eventually gave rise to more complex political structures and what is today considered the beginning of the Swedish kingdom developed over the course of the Viking Age and the subsequent Middle Ages. For a consecutive list from then, the first Swedish king of whom anything definite is known is the 10th-century Eric the Victorious, though the information reported about him in different sources is scarce. Eric's son Olof Skötkonung was the first king to be baptized in Sweden and is credited with founding a Christian kingdom. The early and then medieval Swedish kingdom was an elective monarchy, with kings being elected from particularly prominent families; this practice did however often result in de facto dynastic succession and the formation of royal dynasties, such as those of Eric (intermittently c. 1157–1250) and Bjelbo (1250–1364) as well as infighting between rival families. From 1389 to 1523, Sweden was often united with Denmark and Norway under the kings of the Kalmar Union. Sweden's full independence was restored under Gustav I in 1523, often credited as the founder of modern Sweden, who in 1544 formally abandoned the previous elective monarchy in favor of hereditary succession. Initially adopting the medieval "King of Swedes and Geats", Gustav I later adopted the lengthier title rex Svecorum Gothorum Vandalorumque ("king of the Swedes, Geats and Wends"). The last monarch to be titled as king of the Swedes, Geats and Wends was Gustaf VI Adolf (r. 1950–1973) since his successor, the present king Carl XVI Gustaf, upon his accession adopted the shortened title "King of Sweden". In 1980, the rule of succession was changed from agnatic to absolute primogeniture, to the benefit of Princess Victoria (born 1977), the current heir apparent.   Munsö dynasty   Stenkil dynasty   Munsö dynasty   Estridsen dynasty   Sverker dynasty   Eric dynasty   Bjelbo dynasty   Bjelbo dynasty   Estridsen dynasty   Wittelsbach dynasty   Estridsen dynasty   Wittelsbach dynasty   Oldenburg dynasty   Bjelbo dynasty   Vasa dynasty   Vasa dynasty   Wittelsbach dynasty   Oldenburg dynasty   Wittelsbach dynasty   Oldenburg dynasty   Wittelsbach dynasty   Oldenburg dynasty   Bernadotte dynasty Wikimedia Commons has media related to Monarchs of Sweden.

In the 16th century, kings Eric XIV and Charles IX assumed ahistorical and exaggerated regnal numbers based on the fictitious Swedish history Historia de omnibus Gothorum Sueonumque regibus, which invented several kings of both names. Later kings enumerated themselves after them, and the exaggerated regnal numbers have also been retroactively applied to the earlier kings named Eric and Charles. The numbering used for earlier kings in this list follows the count in Historia de omnibus Gothorum Sueonumque regibus for consistency, which for instance means counting Eric Årsäll but not "Eric and Eric". Eric's accession is traditionally dated to 970, but the date is highly uncertain. Modern scholars often maintain that he died c. 995 but omit the year of his accession. Sources on Eric's parentage are contradictory. Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum (c. 1075) by the German chronicler Adam of Bremen describes him as the son of Emund Eriksson and the later 13th-century Icelandic saga Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks describes him as the son of Björn Eriksson. The by-name "Skötkonung" was a later invention, not attested before the 13th century. Its meaning is obscure and disputed but should probably be understood as skattkonung ("tax-king"), perhaps indicating that Olof paid tribute to another king, possibly the Danish king Sweyn Forkbeard. Alternatively, it might be interpretable as "treasure king", deriving from Olof being the first Swedish king to mint coins. Stenkil is traditionally held to have married "Ingamoder", a daughter of Emund the Old, but sources are too scanty to confidently establish whether this took place. He was also connected to the Munsö dynasty through his father Ragnvald Ulfsson being the nephew of Sigrid the Haughty, mother of Olof Skötkonung. Eric and Eric are recorded only by Adam of Bremen and are not included in any of the known medieval king lists on Swedish rulers, neither native Swedish lists nor Icelandic sources. Liljegren (2004) highlights their dubious history by describing them as "the most anonymous royal figures in Sweden's history" and further states that the period immediately after Stenkil appears to have lacked any real king, with "magnates [standing against] magnates". Older tradition describes one of the Erics as a son of Stenkil ("Eric Stenkilsson") and the other as the pagan son of a daughter of Eric the Victorious ("Eric the Heathen"), though these assumptions cannot be substantiated by the historical record. Anund Gårdske is recorded only by Adam of Bremen and is not included in any of the known medieval king lists on Swedish rulers, neither native Swedish lists nor Icelandic sources. Eric of Pomerania was the son of Maria of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, a granddaughter of Euphemia of Sweden, who in turn was a granddaughter of Magnus III. Sweden changed from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar (the two calendars differ by 11 days) in 1753. This list consistently uses the dates used at the time. Gustav I introduced a crown above the arms, based on its use in the arms of regent Sten Sture the Younger. Though the Swedish monarchy was not hereditary before his reign, Gustav I was also distantly related to medieval Swedish royalty since he was a matrilineal descendant of Birger Jarl, the father of kings Valdemar and Magnus III. Some genealogists claim that he was also a descendant of kings Eric IX and Sverker II. Royal cyphers, also known as monograms, began being used by monarchs throughout Europe in the 16th century. The first Swedish king known to have used a monogram is Eric XIV. The monograms used by Eric XIV and his successor John III were simple, consisting only of their initials and "R" (rex), but monograms grew more elaborate and distinct over time. Heraldic supporters were added to the royal arms in the time of John III. They also appear on the grave monument of Gustav I but this monument was constructed in John III's reign. No monogram attested. Adolf Frederick's mother Albertina Frederica was a great-granddaughter of Catherine of Sweden, a daughter of Charles IX. The addition of a mantle and pavilion to the arms dates to the middle of the 18th century. The so-called Gustavians worked unsuccessfully in the decades that followed Gustav IV Adolf's deposition to restore his line to the throne; his son Gustav, Prince of Vasa (1799–1877), maintained his claim to the Swedish throne and protested the coronations of Oscar I and Charles XV. Gustav's daughter Carola of Vasa (1833–1902), who died childless, was the last member of the Swedish branch of the House of Holstein-Gottorp. The modern Swedish royal family are Gustav IV Adolf's seniormost living descendants through the marriage between his great-granddaughter Victoria of Baden and Gustaf V. Although Charles XIV John was adopted by Charles XIII and the Bernadotte monarchs have since the accession of Gustaf VI Adolf in 1950 also been the senior genealogical descendants of the Holstein-Gottorp kings, the accession of Charles XIV John marked the first new dynastic line since the accession of Gustav I nearly 300 years prior. In the female line also great-great-grandson of Gustav IV Adolf through Victoria of Baden, granddaughter of Gustav IV Adolf's daughter Sophie Vilhelmina. Swedish Royal Court. Myhre 2003, pp. 69, 72.
