She won silver medals at the 2014 Junior World Championships and 2016 Summer Olympics. She represented Belarus at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. She competed in the women's 76 kg event. Naumava has two sisters. All sisters are teachers by profession. They grew up in a peasant family, and the eldest, Polina, trained in kettlebell lifting. Darya first took up shot put and discus throw, but around the age of 16 changed to weightlifting, which fitted better to her relatively short stature (1.65 m).
