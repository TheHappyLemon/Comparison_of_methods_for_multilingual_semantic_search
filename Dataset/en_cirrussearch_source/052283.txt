She originally was awarded the silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the women's 75 kg category with a total of 291 kg. This result was an Olympic record, which was also achieved by Svetlana Podobedova who was awarded a medal the competition by virtue of lighter bodyweight, though Podobedova's medal was also subsequently stripped of her medal due to doping. Zabolotnaya's 131 kg snatch was a (later nullified due to doping-related cheating) Olympic record.
