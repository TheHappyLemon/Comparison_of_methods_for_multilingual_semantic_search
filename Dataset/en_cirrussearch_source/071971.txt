Preceding the hearing, CAS declared in a statement that Abrahamian and the SOC "do not seek from the CAS any particular relief" regarding the ranking of the medals or a review of the IOC decision to exclude Abrahamian from the Games.

While not challenging the outcome of the match or the technical judgments, the arbitration stated that the FILA was required to provide an appeal jury capable to deal promptly with the claims of the athletes. The chairman of the SOC, Stefan Lindeberg, commented that the decision once and for all shows that FILA did not act correctly and that they did not follow their own rules of fair play.
