An ice tongue or glacier tongue exists when there is a narrow floating part of a glacier that extends out into a body of water beyond the glacier's lowest contact with the Earth's crust. An ice tongue forms when a glacier that is confined by a valley moves very rapidly out into a lake or ocean, relative to other ice along the coastline. When such ice surges past adjacent coastal ice, the boundary experiences physical forces described as "shearing". Ice tongues can gain mass from water freezing at their base, by snow falling on top of them, or by additional surges from the main glacier. Mass is then lost by calving or by melting. Icebergs are often formed when ice tongues break off in part or wholly from the main glacier. A few examples of ice tongues are the Erebus Glacier Tongue, Drygalski Ice Tongue, and Thwaites Ice Tongue. Canada, Environment and Climate Change (2010-09-27). "Ice glossary". www.canada.ca.
