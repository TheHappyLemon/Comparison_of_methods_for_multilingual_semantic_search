In 2014, Steve Tignor of Tennis.com called Cibulková "a threat to everyone". In describing her style, he later suggested that "any player, from top pros to rank amateurs, can learn a thing or two from how Cibulková approaches the game," citing aggression, enthusiasm, and a quick pace between points. Self-described as a player with "a lot of energy", Cibulková employed an aggressive style that was largely founded on speed and power. She was known for her remarkable racquet-head speed, which enabled her to produce deep groundstrokes with her forehand and powerful shots with her backhand. She was also known for approaching the net and finishing points with swing volleys. Her aggressive shots have been noted for their ability to force errors or produce winners during extended rallies. When a point ended, Cibulková "refocused right away," using the pace to pressure opponents or avoid negativity. She typically employed a high ball toss and a hard serve. On defense, she often attacked second serves with quick forehands, and hit prompt returns while taking the ball on the rise. Occasionally, she did break a prolonged rally by mixing in a drop shot. Her lower-body strength created quickness around the court, enabling her to reach and return shots.
