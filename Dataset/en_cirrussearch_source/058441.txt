The bank effect (channel effect, bank suction, bank cushion, stern suction, ship-bank interaction) is the tendency of the stern of a ship to swing toward the near bank when operating in a river or constricted waterway. The asymmetric flow around a ship induced by the vicinity of banks causes pressure differences (Bernoulli's principle) between port and starboard sides. As a result, a lateral force will act on the ship, mostly directed towards the closest bank, as well as a yawing moment pushing her bow towards the centre of the waterway. The squat effect increases due to the decreased blockage. This phenomenon depends on many parameters, such as bank shape, water depth, ship-bank distance, ship properties, ship speed and propeller action. A reliable estimation of bank effects is important for determining the limiting conditions in which a ship can safely navigate a waterway. It was cited as a possible cause of the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction by the cargo ship Ever Given.
