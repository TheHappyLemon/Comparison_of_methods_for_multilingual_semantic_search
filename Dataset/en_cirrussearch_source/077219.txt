She continued as a lyricist for many of the band's songs like "Birds Of Peace", "I Don't Care at All", "Black Symphony" etc. Although she initially played a more 'background' role in the group, she featured heavily on their 2005 album Blue Tattoo due to Maarja Kivi (the former lead singer) leaving in 2004.
