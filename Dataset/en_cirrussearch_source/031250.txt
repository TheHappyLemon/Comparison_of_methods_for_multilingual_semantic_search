Náměšť was founded around 1220. The first written mention of Náměšť is from 1234, when the castle was owned by the lords of Lomnice. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Náměšť was frequently conquered and destroyed by various armies. In 1304, Náměšť was destroyed by Cumans, in 1408 by the army of Lacko of Kravaře, and during the Hussite Wars by the armies of Sigismund and Albert II. From 1481 to 1563, Náměšť was owned by the lords of Lomnice again. In 1563, it was acquired by the Zierotin family. Jan the Elder of Zierotin had replaced the old Gothic castle with a new large Renaissance residence. Jan's successor Karl the Elder of Zierotin sold the estate to Albrecht of Wallenstein in 1628, who immediately sold it to the House of Werdenberg. The Werdenberg family owned it until 1733. From 1752 until the abolition of manorialism, Náměšť was in the possession of the Haugwitz family. The railway was built in 1866. In 1923, Náměšť nad Oslavou was promoted to a town. The I/23 road (the section from Třebíč to Rosice) passes through the municipality. Náměšť nad Oslavou is located on the railway line Brno–Plzeň via Třebíč and České Budějovice. Since 1986, the town has been hosting the folk music festival Folkové prázdniny ("Folk Holidays"). The town is known for its Baroque bridge. It was built in 1737 and is decorated by twenty sculptures. It has the richest sculptural decoration in Moravia and the second richest in the country after the Charles Bridge in Prague. Náměšť nad Oslavou Castle is the main landmark of the town and a national cultural monument. It is located on a hilltop above the town. It was built in 1572–1579. Today it is open to the public.
