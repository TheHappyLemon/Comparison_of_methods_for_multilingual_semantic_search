John and Edward Grimes (born 16 October 1991), collectively known as Jedward, are an Irish singing and television presenting duo. They are identical twins who first appeared as John & Edward in the sixth series of The X Factor in 2009, generating a phenomenon of ironic popularity described as "the Jedward paradox". They were the seventh contestant eliminated and were managed by Louis Walsh, who was their mentor during The X Factor. Jedward have released four studio albums: Planet Jedward (2010), Victory (2011), Young Love (2012), and Voice of a Rebel (2019). Their first two albums went double platinum in Ireland. They have released several singles, including "Under Pressure (Ice Ice Baby)", "Bad Behaviour", "Lipstick", with which they represented Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 in Düsseldorf, and "Waterline", with which they represented Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku. Jedward are also known for their television work, including starring in the documentary series Jedward: Let Loose (2010), presenting the children's series OMG! Jedward's Dream Factory (2011 –2013) and Jedward's Big Adventure (2012–2014), and participating in the reality series Celebrity Big Brother 8 (2011), Celebrity Big Brother 19 (2017), in which they finished as runners-up, and Celebrity Coach Trip 4 (2019). Jedwards's combined net worth was estimated at €6m in September 2013, and they have been ranked as the fifth most financially successful former X Factor UK contestants. Identical twin brothers John Paul Henry Daniel Richard Grimes and Edward Peter Anthony Kevin Patrick Grimes were born in Dublin. John and Edward's first school was Scoil Bhríde National School in Rathangan. They then attended King's Hospital School for four years before being moved to the Dublin Institute of Education. The twins competed in school talent shows during their school years and were inspired by Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. They were also members of the Lucan Harriers Athletic Club and Dundrum South Dublin athletics club and have competed in several Irish athletic tournaments. In addition, they briefly worked as games testers for Xbox 360 format holder Microsoft and support football clubs Newcastle United and Celtic. In 2008, John and Edward formed a duo and the following year they auditioned in Glasgow as a group for the sixth series of The X Factor, under the name John & Edward. Despite being described by judge Simon Cowell as "not very good and incredibly annoying", John & Edward were put through to bootcamp, then made it to judges' houses, where Louis Walsh selected them for the live shows. John & Edward became known for their unpolished but enthusiastic performances, famously including a version of Britney Spears' "Oops!... I Did It Again", during which they reenacted the Titanic monologue. After their departure from The X Factor, Jedward were signed to Modest! Management, however it was later announced that Louis Walsh had reached "an amicable agreement", which allowed him to take the twins on. From February until April 2010, they performed on the X Factor Live tour, where they were credited with the boost in demand for tickets, that led to an extension in the tour run. Their debut single "Under Pressure (Ice Ice Baby)" was a mashup of "Under Pressure" and "Ice Ice Baby", with Vanilla Ice contributing guest vocals. In March Jedward's Sony contract ended, but the following day Universal Music Ireland signed them on a three-album contract. In April 2010, Jedward began their first solo tour, a 27-date tour of Ireland called the Planet Jedward Tour. Due to popular demand, it was extended with a second 43-date leg in the UK and Ireland. The Irish Independent rated the tour positively, saying that "Jedwardmania is right up there with Beatlemania." Jedward's second single, a cover of the Blink-182 song "All the Small Things", was released in July 2010 and peaked at number 21 on the Irish charts and number 6 on the UK Indie Chart. The same week, Jedward released their debut album Planet Jedward, consisting of cover versions. It which went straight to number one on the Irish Albums Chart and number 17 on the UK Albums Chart. In August 2010, Jedward appeared in their own ITV2 documentary, entitled Jedward: Let Loose, a three-part series in which they moved out of their home for ten days. On 12 February 2011, Jedward released their third single and Eurovision Song Contest entry "Lipstick", which peaked at number one in Ireland. Jedward successfully qualified from the second Eurovision Song Contest semi-final, eventually finishing in eighth place. After the Eurovision Song Contest, "Lipstick" was released digitally across Europe, where it charted in many countries such as Belgium, Sweden, Germany and most notably Austria where it peaked at number three. The song also peaked at number 8 in the South Korea's international artists' chart. "Lipstick" had featured in a Hyundai advertising campaign in South East Asia. Shortly after the Eurovision Song Contest, on 23 May, Jedward performed in front of an audience of 60,000 people at College Green in Dublin City ahead of a speech by visiting U.S. President Barack Obama. In April 2011, Jedward began their second tour, the Bad Behaviour Tour, with a series of dates across Ireland. Jedward's next single "Bad Behaviour" was released in July and reached number one in the Irish charts. This was followed two weeks later by their second album Victory, consisting entirely of original tracks. A new version of Planet Jedward was released by the German branch of Universal Music in July, featuring a mix of tracks from Planet Jedward and new songs from Victory. On 31 July, the twins began the first leg of their third tour, The Carnival Tour, with 12 shows across Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Jedward are involved with many charity projects, and were one of the highest rated charity ambassadors in Ireland for 2011. Jedward are ambassadors for the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC) and have fronted an ISPCC poster campaign. The proceeds of their Euro 2012 charity single "Put the Green Cape On" also went to the ISPCC.

In 2010, Jedward fronted an advertising campaign for Irish fast food chain Abrakebabra. Jedward have also fronted advertising campaigns for East Midlands Trains, Rowntree's Randoms, Disney Universe and a Travel Supermarket commercial with comedian Omid Djalili. The last was later banned after the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the advert was misleading. In 2011, they fronted an advertising campaign for mobile network 3 Ireland, including their own Jedward-branded mobile phone. Between 2010 and 2013, Jedward performed in an annual pantomime over the Christmas and New Year period. Based at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin, the pantomimes also starred Linda Martin. John and Edward played themselves and the shows featured Jedward songs. The twins' first show was Cinderella in 2010, where they played the fairy godbrothers.[citation needed] They returned in 2011 with a sell-out season of Jedward and the Beanstalk, and again in 2012 with Jedward and the Magic Lamp. In 2013 their fourth and last pantomime was Jedward in Beauty and the Beast. Jedward have been signed to Next Models and appeared in fashion magazines i-D, Esquire and Grazia.[citation needed] Whilst on The X Factor, Jedward's fans included Pixie Lott and Robbie Williams. Taoiseach Brian Cowen also backed the singers, while Leona Lewis said that she worried about them. Two leading British political parties, Labour and the Conservatives, each released campaign posters parodying the twins. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown came under fire in November 2009 for describing Jedward as "not very good" and later apologised for doing so. Following this, Walsh stated "So Gordon Brown and Simon Cowell both have something in common: neither of them know what the public want." Brown's successor, David Cameron, admitted that he enjoyed watching The X Factor and that Jedward were his favourite act. Cameron also bought a T-shirt with their faces on it. The Irish Independent called Jedward "tone-deaf twins", even though the pair were voted more popular than The Beatles in a teenage poll. Comedian Oliver Callan has parodied them on his RTÉ 2 show Nob Nation. Their 2017 court case on merchandise rights was later the subject of a stage musical starring comedians Kevin McGahern and Tony Cantwell.
