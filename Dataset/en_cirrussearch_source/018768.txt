Čadca (pronunciation; until 1918 Čatca, Czača, Hungarian: Csaca, Polish: Czadca) is a district town in northern Slovakia, near the border with Poland and the Czech Republic. The name is derived from a word čad (smoke, soot; Proto-Slavic: čadъ, Slovak/Czech: čad, Polish: czad ). The form Čadca is a toponymic appellative. The name was probably motivated by the burning glades. It is located south of the Jablunkov Pass, surrounded by the Javorníky, Kysucké Beskydy and Turzovská vrchovina mountain ranges. It lies in the valley of the Kysuca river, around 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of Žilina and is part of the historic region of Kysuce. A Goral minority lives in the surroundings. The town was established in the 17th century; the first written reference dates back to 1565 as Tzaczcka. The town charter was granted in 1778. According to the 2010 census, the town had 24,959 inhabitants with 2.2% Czech and 0.4% Roma. The religious make-up was 82.97% Roman Catholics and 0.36% Lutherans; most of others stated no religious affiliation. One of the world's largest (and last) producers of vacuum tubes, JJ Electronic has a factory in Čadca. Čadca railway station is the town's main station. It forms part of the cross-border Žilina–Čadca–Svrčinovec zastávka–Mosty u Jablunkova railway (to the Czech Republic), and is also a junction station for two other lines, one of them also cross-border (to Poland).
