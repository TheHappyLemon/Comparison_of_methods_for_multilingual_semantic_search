The Argentina national ice hockey team (Spanish: Selección de hockey sobre hielo de Argentina) is the national men's ice hockey team of Argentina. The team is controlled by the Argentine Association of Ice and In-Line Hockey (AAHHL) and has been an associate member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) since 31 May 1998. Argentina is currently not ranked in the IIHF World Ranking and has not entered in any IIHF World Championship events, but they have played in the Amerigol LATAM Cup since 2018, a tournament for teams mostly from Latin America and the Caribbean. Argentina played its first game in February 2012 against Mexico in a friendly match in Cuautitlán Izcalli, Mexico. Argentina lost the game 1–5. The following day, they played their second friendly match against Mexico and suffered a wider loss of 1–10. Argentina has participated in all four editions of the Pan American Ice Hockey Tournament. In the 2014 Pan American Ice Hockey Tournament, they recorded their first ever victory, defeating Brazil by a score of 5–3. They finished fourth after losing to Colombia in the bronze medal game, 9–1. After disappointing performances in the 2015 and 2016 tournaments, in which the team finished near last place both times, Argentina obtained its first ever international ice hockey medal in the 2017 tournament. Argentina recorded the tournament's biggest ever win with a 26–0 score against Chile, before defeating Mexico's U23 squad 6–1 in the bronze medal match. While the LATAM Cup is the only annual competition for Argentina, it is not an IIHF-sanctioned tournament, and therefore does not count towards Argentina's official international record. In 2018, 2019 and 2021, Argentina participated in the LATAM Cup tournament hosted by the Amerigol International Hockey Association. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no 2020 edition of the tournament. The event is hosted at the Florida Panthers Ice Den in Coral Springs, Florida. Argentina won against Brazil, Venezuela, and Mexico, before a semi-final elimination in 2018 and quarter-final eliminations in both 2019 and 2021. In the 2021 edition, Argentina was eliminated in double overtime by the eventual champions, Colombia. 2023 version of the LATAM cup was played again in Coral Springs, Florida at the Florida Panthers Ice Den and for the first time the Argentina Men's Division 1 team captured GOLD placing 1st overall. Argentina went 5–0 through the whole tournament (wins against Greece 2x, Mexico & Lebanon 2x) and capped it off with a Double OverTime game-winning goal by Captain Owen Haiek. In March 2022, Argentina won their first ever championship in ice hockey national team competition at the 2022 Amerigol LATAM Spring Classic in Farmers Branch, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. Argentina was undefeated in this tournament. In the group phase, the team defeated Venezuela (11–3), recorded their first ever victory against Colombia (8–3), defeated Puerto Rico (4–2), and defeated Brazil (10–6). In the semi-finals, Argentina again defeated Venezuela (10–3), before winning the championship against Puerto Rico by a score of 6–3. The title win received significant mainstream press coverage in Argentina.
