Zamboanga Sibugay was formerly part of Zamboanga del Sur. Attempts to divide Zamboanga del Sur into two separate provinces date as far back as the 1960s. Several bills were filed in the Philippine Congress, but remained unacted.

Hofer is the governor of the province, while the representatives of the first and second districts are Wilter Palma and Antonieta "Tata" Eudela, respectively.
