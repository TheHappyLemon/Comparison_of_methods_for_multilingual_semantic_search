Sports Illustrated wrote, "Few early 20th Century players were as revered as Hare, who played every minute of every game." He was selected as a charter member of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951. Hare was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Emily Power (née Beale) and Horace Binney Hare, a successful attorney. He came from a long line of lawyers.
