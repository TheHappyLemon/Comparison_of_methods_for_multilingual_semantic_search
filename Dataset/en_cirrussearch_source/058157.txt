The 1967–68 European Cup was the 13th European Cup, UEFA's premier club football tournament. The competition was won by Manchester United, who beat Benfica 4–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium, London. The European Cup title marked the tenth year since the Munich air disaster, in which eight United players were killed and their manager, Matt Busby, was left close to death, the day after earning a place in the semi-finals of the 1957–58 competition. It was also the first time an English side had won the trophy. The away goals rule (which had already been used in the Cup Winners' Cup and the Fairs' Cup) was introduced if aggregate scores were level after two legs, but only for the first round of the competition. Extra time goals were not included in the rule. Celtic were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Dynamo Kyiv in the first round. 20 September 1967 GSP Stadium, Nicosia Attendance: 4,000 Referee: Aurelio Angonese (Italy) 20 September 1967 Old Trafford, Manchester Attendance: 43,912 Referee: Pereira da Costa (Portugal) 20 September 1967 20:00 Celtic Park, Glasgow Attendance: 52,223 Referee: Kurt Waldemar Tschenscher (West Germany) 20 September 1967 Silesian Stadium, Chorzów Attendance: 35,665 Referee: Rudolf Glöckner (East Germany) 20 September 1967 St. Jakob Stadium, Basel Attendance: 13,344 Referee: Gyula Emsberger (Hungary) 20 September 1967 Olympisch Stadion, Amsterdam Attendance: 55,940 Referee: Jim Finney (England) 20 September 1967 Bislett Stadion, Oslo Attendance: 16,123 Referee: Bertil Lööw (Sweden) 20 September 1967 Ernst-Thälmann-Stadion, Karl-Marx-Stadt Attendance: 29,260 Referee: Kevin Howley (England) 20 September 1967 Oriel Park, Dundalk Attendance: 4,177 Referee: Laurens van Ravens (Netherlands) 17 September 1967 Laugardalsvöllur, Reykjavík Attendance: 3,125 Referee: John Russel (Northern Ireland) 13 September 1967 The Oval, Belfast Attendance: 24,750 Referee: Roger Barde (France) 20 September 1967 Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Étienne Attendance: 18,948 Referee: Leo Callaghan (Wales) 13 September 1967 Mithatpaşa Stadium, Istanbul Attendance: 31,208 Referee: Goncho Rusev (Bulgaria) 20 September 1967 Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium, Piraeus Attendance: 35,702 Referee: Lajos Horvath (Hungary) 27 September 1967 (1967-09-27) 9th September Stadium, Plovdiv Attendance: 11,600 Referee: Sergei Alimov (Soviet Union) 11 October 1967 Koševo Stadium, Sarajevo Attendance: 4,308 Referee: Gyula Gere (Hungary) Sarajevo won 5–3 on aggregate. 27 September 1967 Empire Stadium, Gżira Attendance: 23,217 Referee: Bruno de Marchi (Italy) Manchester United won 4–0 on aggregate. 4 October 1967 19:00 Central Stadium, Kyiv Attendance: 68,352 Referee: Antonio Sbardella (Italy) Dynamo Kyiv won 3–2 on aggregate. 4 October 1967 Stockholms Olympiastadion, Stockholm Attendance: 1,364 Referee: Tage Sørensen (Denmark) Górnik Zabrze won 4–0 on aggregate. 18 October 1967 Idrætsparken, Copenhagen Attendance: 9,363 Referee: Ken Dagnall (England) Hvidovre won 5–4 on aggregate. 11 October 1967 Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid Attendance: 39,244 Referee: Bobby Davidson (Scotland) Real Madrid won 3–2 on aggregate. 4 October 1967 Letná Stadium, Prague Attendance: 4,000 Referee: Franz Mayer (Austria) Sparta Prague won 2–1 on aggregate. 18 October 1967 Émile Versé Stadium, Brussels Attendance: 28,831 Referee: José María Ortiz de Mendíbil (Spain) Anderlecht won 5–2 on aggregate. 11 October 1967 Népstadion, Budapest Attendance: 74,117 Referee: Josef Krňávek (Czechoslovakia) Vasas won 9–1 on aggregate. 1 October 1967 Stade Émile Mayrisch, Esch-sur-Alzette Attendance: 4,552 Referee: Michel Kitabdjian (France) 4–4 on aggregate;
