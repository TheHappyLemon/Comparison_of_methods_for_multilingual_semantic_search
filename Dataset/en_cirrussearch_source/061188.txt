Lindner started his career with the reserve team for Austria Wien where he made 32 appearances. He then went on to make 187 first team appearances. In January 2015, Lindner was about to transfer to La Liga club Córdoba, but the move fell through. Lindner instead agreed a transfer with German club Eintracht Frankfurt. He played in Frankfurt for two seasons. For two seasons he played in the Swiss Super League for Grasshopper Club, but following their relegation he moved on to Wehen Wiesbaden. On 8 September 2020, FC Basel announced that they had signed Lindner on a three-year contract. Lindner joined Basel's first team for their 2020–21 season under head coach Ciriaco Sforza. Originally signed as backup goalkeeper, Lindner played his domestic league debut for the club in the home game in the Stadion Wankdorf on 21 November as Basel were defeated 1–2 by Young Boys. Lindner then established himself as first choice goalkeeper. He stayed with the club for two seasons and then moved on. During his period with the club Lindner played a total of 90 games for Basel. 67 of these games were in the Swiss Super League, 14 in the UEFA Europa Conference League and 9 were friendly games. On 26 June 2022, Lindner signed with Sion. On 16 May 2023, the player announced he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer. He returned to training a month later, however he did not return to the FC Sion squad, as the club did not request a license for him.
