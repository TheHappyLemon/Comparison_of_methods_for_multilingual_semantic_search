Following the draft, Smith began his freshman season with the Redhawks in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) while majoring in sport studies. Although he admitted to being shocked at the speed of collegiate hockey, Smith recorded eight goals and 20 points in 43 games. During the season, he was also selected to take part in Canada's National Junior Team selection camp. Upon returning to the RedHawks for his sophomore season, Smith experienced a breakout year and recorded 54 points in 38 games.

During his first 11 games in the AHL, he had recorded three assists. He was promoted to Dallas for the season once play resumed in January 2013 and scored his first career NHL goal on February 15, 2013, against Cory Schneider of the Vancouver Canucks. His second goal came a few days later in a 4–3 loss to the Calgary Flames. As a result of his early success, Smith was promoted to a top six position in February and played left wing on a line with Derek Roy and Loui Eriksson. After playing in 28 games for Dallas, and recording six points, he was reassigned to the AHL alongside defenseman Joe Morrow. He was recalled shortly thereafter after recording one goal and one assist during a game against the Houston Aeros. In July 2013, Smith was included in a blockbuster trade between Dallas and the Boston Bruins, which sent him, Loui Eriksson, Joe Morrow and Matt Fraser to Boston in exchange for Tyler Seguin, Rich Peverley and Ryan Button.

However, as a result of injuries, Smith was moved up to a line with Patrice Bergeron and Loui Eriksson. He finished the regular season with 19 goals and 30 assists which included 17 points throughout November. As a result of his success, the New England Sports Network (NESN) TV network named Smith the 45th annual "7th Player." The "7th Player" is awarded to the Boston Bruin who most exceeded all expectations that season, as voted by the team's fans. The following year, Smith finished with 13 goals and 27 assists, plus four goals and an assist in 12 playoff games. On July 1, 2015, Smith was traded by the Bruins, along with Marc Savard's contract, to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Jimmy Hayes. During his first season with the team, Smith recorded a new career high 50 points in 82 games and tied for third on the team in goal scoring. On July 3, 2016, Smith signed a five-year, $25 million contract extension with the Panthers. Following the contract extension, Smith had a self described "disappointing year" after he recorded 15 goals and 22 assists in the 2016–17 season. On June 21, 2017, Smith was traded at the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft to the Vegas Golden Knights due to salary cap issues. Both he and teammate Jonathan Marchessault were acquired by the Golden Knights, with the Panthers receiving a fourth-round pick in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. During his tenure in Florida, Smith had 87 points in 162 games. Following the trade, Smith began the 2017–18 season as a winger with William Karlsson and Marchessault. Their line received early praise for being amongst the team's best lines, with them all scoring high by November. Upon entering January, Smith had become a prominent fixture on the first line as they had combined for 19 goals and 24 assists. The following month, Smith was recognized as an NHL Third Star of the Month of February after posting 20 points in 14 games. Smith would go on to score a career-high 60 points in the regular season as the Knights advanced all the way to the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals. During their postseason run, Smith scored five goals and 17 assists. Following his career-high season, Smith stayed consistent with his offensive abilities and recorded the second-best statistical season of his career. He tied Marchessault for the team lead in assists with 34 and surpassed the 50-point mark for the second season in a row. Upon returning to the Knights, Smith remained with Marchessault and Karlsson and recorded his 100th career NHL goal in a 4–2 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 11, 2018. Later that season, he also appeared in his 500th career NHL game, while also maintaining eight points in his past three games. As the Knights qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the second consecutive year, Smith recorded one goal and five assists in their series against the San Jose Sharks. At the time of the pausing of the 2019–20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Smith had scored a career high 27 goals in 71 games played. After surpassing the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, Smith tied with Mark Stone for team lead in points. As the playoffs continued, Smith experienced an 11 game goal drought which was snapped in Game 5 of the Western Conference Final against the Dallas Stars. Following the naming of Mark Stone as team captain, Smith was appointed an alternate captain alongside Alex Pietrangelo. While playing in his 628 career game, Smith recorded his first professional hat-trick in a 4–1 win over the St. Louis Blues on May 9, 2021. On July 13, 2022, Smith signed a three-year, $15 million contract to remain with the Golden Knights. By the 2022–23 season, Smith was one of six remaining original members of the Golden Knights, alongside Marchessault, Karlsson, Brayden McNabb, Shea Theodore and William Carrier. The team reached the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time, winning the Cup over the Florida Panthers in five games. Smith and four of the other original Golden Knights started the decisive Game 5. On June 28, 2023, Smith was traded by the Golden Knights to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for a third round pick in the 2024 NHL Entry Draft. The move was precipitated by the Golden Knights' desire to retain newly-acquired forward Ivan Barbashev, with general manager Kelly McCrimmon stating "to get there, we moved Reilly to Pittsburgh to facilitate some of the other moves that we want to make." During the first game of the 2023–24 season, Smith and Bryan Rust scored in the first 41 seconds of the third period to become the second-fastest Penguins teammates to score at the start of a period in franchise history.
