.fo is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Faroe Islands. The .fo domain was operated by UNI-C, the Danish University Network organisation until June 1997. It then passed under the control of Tele2 DK, who had bought the activities of UNI-C as part of a privatisation. In July 1998, the operation was handed to nic.fo as a gesture of good will, and recognition that .fo was indeed Faroese. Type A registrations must respond to a trademark of the registrant. Type B registrations are possible if you do not hold a matching trademark. Any entity which owns the corresponding trademark can file an opposition within 20 days after the domain registration and be awarded the concerned domain name itself.
