Progress M-66 (Russian: Прогресс М-66), identified by NASA as Progress 32P, was a Progress spacecraft used to resupply the International Space Station. It was the penultimate flight of the Progress-M 11F615A55 spacecraft, using the spacecraft with the serial number 366. Progress M-66 was launched at 05:49 UTC on 10 February 2009, by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket flying from Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. This was the first time Site 31 had been used for a Progress launch since Progress M-15 in 1992. The spacecraft docked with the Pirs module of the ISS at 07:18 UTC on 13 February 2009. It undocked at 15:18 UTC on 6 May 2009, to make way for Progress M-02M. It was deorbited at 14:28:30 UTC on 18 May 2009 following twelve days of free flight, during which it conducted experiments as part of the Plazma-Progress programme. Any debris from Progress M-66 that survived re-entry landed in the Pacific Ocean at around 15:14:45 UTC. Progress M-66 delivered supplies to the International Space Station, including fuel, food and water for the crew, and equipment for conducting scientific research and establishing a 6-man crew capacity aboard the ISS. It also carried a new Orlan-MK spacesuit to replace one of the older Orlan-M suits previously used for EVAs from the station.
