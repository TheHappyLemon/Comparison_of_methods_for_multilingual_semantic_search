33 (thirty-three) is the natural number following 32 and preceding 34. 33 is the 21st composite number, and 8th distinct semiprime (third of the form 3×q{\displaystyle 3\times q} where q{\displaystyle q} is a higher prime). It is one of two numbers to have an aliquot sum of 15 = 3 × 5 — the other being the square of 4 — and part of the aliquot sequence of 9 = 32 in the aliquot tree (33, 15, 9, 4, 3, 2, 1). It is the largest positive integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of different triangular numbers, and it is the largest of twelve integers that are not the sum of five non-zero squares; on the other hand, the 33rd triangular number 561 is the first Carmichael number. 33 is also the first non-trivial dodecagonal number (like 369, and 561) and the first non-unitary centered dodecahedral number. It is also the sum of the first four positive factorials, and the sum of the sum of the divisors of the first six positive integers; respectively: 33=1!+2!+3!+4!=1+2+6+2433=1+3+4+7+6+12{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}33&=1!+2!+3!+4!=1+2+6+24\\33&=1+3+4+7+6+12\\\end{aligned}}} It is the first member of the first cluster of three semiprimes 33, 34, 35; the next such cluster is 85, 86, 87. It is also the smallest integer such that it and the next two integers all have the same number of divisors (four). 33 is the number of unlabeled planar simple graphs with five nodes. 33 is equal to the sum of the squares of the digits of its own square in nonary (14409), hexadecimal (44116) and unotrigesimal (14431). For numbers greater than 1, this is a rare property to have in more than one base. It is also a palindrome in both decimal and binary (100001). 33 was the second to last number less than 100 whose representation as a sum of three cubes was found (in 2019): 33=88661289752875283+(−8778405442862239)3+(−2736111468807040)3.{\displaystyle 33=8866128975287528^{3}+(-8778405442862239)^{3}+(-2736111468807040)^{3}.} Importantly, the ratio of prime numbers to non-primes at 33 in the sequence of natural numbers N+{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} ^{+}} (up to) is 12{\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}}, where there are (inclusively) 11 prime numbers and 22 non-primes (i.e., when including 1). Where 33 is divisible by the number of prime numbers below it (11), the product 11×33=363{\displaystyle 11\times 33=363} is the seventh numerator of harmonic number H7{\displaystyle H_{7}}, where specifically, the previous such numerators are 49 and 137, which are respectively the thirty-third composite and prime numbers. A positive definite quadratic integer matrix represents all odd numbers when it contains at least the set of seven integers: {1,3,5,7,11,15,33}.{\displaystyle \{1,3,5,7,11,15,\mathbf {33} \}.} The atomic number of arsenic. 33 is, according to the Newton scale, the temperature at which water boils.

The New General Catalogue object NGC 33, a double star in the constellation Pisces The smallest dwarf planet in the Solar System is Ceres, which is also the 33rd largest celestial body in the Solar System, comprising about one-third of the mass in the asteroid belt. 33 is the number of years that it takes for the Lunar phase to return to its original position in relation to the Solar calendar. A Lunar month (Synodic) contains 29.53 days. A twelve-month lunar year contains 354.36 days. A solar year (Tropical year) totals 365.24 days. The lunar year is therefore 10.88 days shorter than the 12-month solar year. As each year passes, the lunar month trails 10.88 days behind the solar year. On the turn of the 33rd year, the lunar month is approximately 359.04 days, close to one whole year behind the solar calendar from the original position measured, thus it has a 33-year cycle in relation to the solar year. Where the lunar year 354.36=l{\displaystyle 354.36=l} and the solar year 365.24=s{\displaystyle 365.24=s}, then s−l=d{\displaystyle s-l=d} and 33l=33(s−d){\displaystyle 33l=33(s-d)}. Many cultures and civilisations have based their calendar on the lunar cycles including the Athenian Attic calendar and the Islamic Calendar, the Hijri calendar based on lunar observation.
