Slovakia competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's sixth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics after gaining its independence from the former Czechoslovakia. The Slovak Olympic Committee fielded a team of 51 athletes, 32 men and 19 women, across 12 sports at the Games. Although its full roster was larger by four athletes than in London 2012, this was still one of Slovakia's smallest delegations sent to the Summer Olympics. Slovakia made its Olympic debut in archery, as well as its return to synchronized swimming and table tennis after nearly a decade. The Slovak team featured 17 returning Olympians, including skeet shooter Danka Barteková, who won the bronze in London four years earlier, 2015 world champion Matej Tóth, who entered his fourth consecutive Games as a top medal favorite in the 50 km race walk, and sprint kayaker and two-time medalist Erik Vlček, who joined the slalom canoe legend Michal Martikán as the only Slovaks participating in five Olympics. The only medalist returning from the previous Games to compete in Rio de Janeiro, Barteková was nominated by the committee to carry the Slovak flag at the opening ceremony. Other notable Slovak athletes included pro mountain biker Peter Sagan, twins Dana and Jana Velďáková in both long and triple jump, slalom canoe duo and cousins Ladislav and Peter Škantár, and world-ranked triathlete Richard Varga. Slovakia left Rio de Janeiro with four medals (two gold and two silver), matching its overall tally from the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Among the medalists were Tóth, who walked away with Slovakia's first ever track and field gold in his event, and the Škantár cousins, who succeeded the Hochschorner twins Pavol and Peter to win the Olympic title in the slalom canoe double. One Slovak archer has qualified for the women's individual recurve at the Olympics by securing one of three available Olympic spots at the 2016 European Championships in Nottingham, Great Britain, signifying the nation's Olympic debut in the sport. Meanwhile, another Slovak archer was added to the squad by virtue of a top five national finish in the men's individual recurve at the 2016 Archery World Cup meet in Antalya, Turkey.

Having been directly entered to the singles, Kližan also opted to play with his rookie partner Andrej Martin in the men's doubles. On July 27, 2016, Kližan pulled out from the Games due to his concerns about the Zika virus. Thereby, Martin replaced him in the men's singles and was subsequently set to play with Igor Zelenay in the men's doubles.
