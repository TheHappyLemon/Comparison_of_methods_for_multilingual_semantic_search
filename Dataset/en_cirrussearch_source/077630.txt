Petr Čajánek (Czech pronunciation: [ˈpɛtr̩ ˈtʃajaːnɛk] ; born August 18, 1975) is a Czech former professional ice hockey forward. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the St. Louis Blues from 2002 to 2007. The rest of his career, which lasted from 1993 to 2015, was mainly spent in the Czech Extraliga. He was selected by the Blues in the seventh round, 253rd overall, in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. Internationally he played for the Czech national team at several tournaments, including the 2002, 2006, and 2010 Winter Olympics, winning a bronze medal in 2006, and several Ice Hockey World Championships, winning gold medals in 2000, 2001, and 2005. In the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, he was drafted in the seventh round, 253rd overall, by the St. Louis Blues. He was then signed to an NHL contract. Petr Čajánek played for HC Zlín from 1993 to 2002. In the 2001–02 season, he was Czech Extraliga's leading scorer. On February 26, 2007, Čajánek was placed on waivers by the St. Louis Blues, which would have effectively allowed any other NHL club to sign him. When no other NHL teams tendered Čajánek an offer, the Blues re-signed him to a league-minimum contract, and added him back to their roster. Though he was placed on waivers, the 2006–07 season was his best, as he scored a career-high 48 points, good for third on the Blues. On October 21, 2007, Čajánek signed a one-year, $900,000 contract to play for Ak Bars Kazan in the Russian Superleague (RSL) for the 2007–08 season.
