In 1946, during the Chinese Civil War, the CPC Directorate General of Shandong Wartime Posts was moved from the Yimeng Mountains to Linyi and renamed the Shandong Provincial Postal Administration. After the People's Republic of China was founded in October 1949, the administrative division was adjusted.[citation needed] In 2005, Linyi drew international attention as a center of human rights abuses related to the enforcement of China's controversial family planning policies.
