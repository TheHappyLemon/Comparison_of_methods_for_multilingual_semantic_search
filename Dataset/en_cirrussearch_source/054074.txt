FC Nitra is a Slovak association football club, playing in the town of Nitra. Established in 1909, FC Nitra is one of the oldest football clubs in Slovakia. Nitra were promoted and relegated 4 times from the Czechoslovak First League with their longest stay being 5 years (1979–1984, 1986–1991). Nitra came close to clinching the title in 1962 only to lose out by 3 points to Dukla Prague. This year was most successful in club history because they reached also Mitropa Cup final. Another successful period was end of 80s when Nitra stayed on top positions in Czechoslovak First League (in 1989 they reached 3rd place) with players like Michal Hipp, Ľubomír Moravčík, Ladislav Molnár, Peter Palúch, Jozef Majoroš, Róbert Tomaschek, Miroslav Sovič. FC Nitra was the first football professional club in the former Czechoslovakia.[citation needed] 14 March 1962 Štadión pod Zoborom, Nitra 4 April 1962 Stadio Comunale, Bologna Nitra was involved in the inaugural Slovakian championship in 1994 but was relegated to the second division after their first season. The following season they were promoted back to the first division, only for the same fate to occur and were again relegated. Roller coaster seasons became somewhat of an FC Nitra speciality during the early 90s, until the promotions stopped in 2001 where fans had to wait five long seasons before seeing their club again return to the top flight where they finished with a respectable fifth place. This was mainly due to the work of head coach Ivan Galád, who took control of the team in the winter of 2004, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in the second division.[citation needed] Róbert Rák became the top goal scorer both in the second division in the 2004/2005 season and (together with Erik Jendrišek) in the first division in the 2005/2006 season. In the beginning of the next season he was transferred to MFK Ružomberok. Galád coached the team very defensively (as according to his words no good striker was in the team). Galád lost his job after not much good results of the team at the end of 2006/2007 season (many losses and draws).[citation needed] The former Czech player Pavel Hapal was named as the head coach of the team for the 2007/2008 season. His way of coaching brought almost immediately very good results and the team finished 3rd (the best in the history of the club). After the season Hapal decided to leave the club to accept an offer from the top Czech club FK Mladá Boleslav. Pavel Malura, another coach from the Czech Republic, has taken the job. In spring 2009 the new manager Petar Kurčubić was appointed. In 2021 after the club was relegated from the top flight, they did not obtain a licence for the league below and so were further demoted another level. 1909 – Founded as Nyitrai ÖTTSO 1911 – Renamed Nyitrai TVE 1919 – Renamed Nyitrai SC 1921 – Renamed SK Nitra 1923 – Renamed AC Nitra 1948 – Renamed Sokol Nitra 1949 – Renamed ZSJ Sokol spojene zavody Nitra 1949 – Renamed ZK KP Nitra 1953 – Renamed DSO Slavoj Nitra 1956 – Renamed TJ Slovan Nitra 1966 – Again Renamed AC Nitra 1976 – Renamed TJ Plastika Nitra 1989 – First European qualification, 1990 1990 – Renamed FC Nitra Czechoslovakia Czechoslovak First League (1925–1993) Runners-Up (1): 1961–62 Third place (1): 1988–89 1.SNL (1st Slovak National football league) (1969–1993) Winners (3): 1978–79, 1985–86, 1991–92 Slovakia Slovak League (1993–Present) Third place (1): 2007–08 Slovenský Pohár (Slovak Cup) (1961–Present) 1 Runners-up (4): 1974–75, 1982–83, 1986–87, 1990–91 Slovak Second Division (1993–Present) Winners (3): 1994–95, 1997–98, 2004–05 Runners-Up (2): 2000–01, 2016–17 The Czechoslovak League top scorer from 1944–45 until 1992–93.
