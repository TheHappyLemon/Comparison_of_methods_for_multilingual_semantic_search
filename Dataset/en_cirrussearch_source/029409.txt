The icebreaker was given the name of the spiritual leader of The First Latvian National Awakening and the most prominent member of the Young Latvians movement Krišjānis Valdemārs (1825–1891). Krišjānis Valdemārs sailed on 13 January 1926 on its first voyage from the port of Riga. The first captain of the icebreaker was Kārlis Cērpe (1875–1931).

At the end of August 1941 Krišjānis Valdemārs took part in Soviet evacuation of Tallinn to Kronstadt, but struck a naval mine on 28 August and sunk. Krišjānis Valdemārs, loaded with cargo, was bombed and sunk in the Gulf of Finland by Junkers Ju 88 aircraft of Kampfgeschwader 77, Luftwaffe.
