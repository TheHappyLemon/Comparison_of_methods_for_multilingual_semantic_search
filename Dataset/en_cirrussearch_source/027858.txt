The first written mention of Bojkovice is from 1362. It was promoted to a market town in 1449. In the 16th century, Bojkovice was attacked and plundered by the Hungarians, bringing periods of famine. The 19th century brought greater prosperity, as railroads and electrical grids entered the area. During World War II, it was occupied by Nazi Germany, who converted the local factory to war-materials production. The municipality received the town status in 1965. The main attraction is the Nový Světlov Castle. The original fort was built in the 1480s to protect the town from the attacks of Hungarians. In the second half of the 19th century, it was converted into a castle in the Tudor neo-Gothic style. The parish Church of Saint Lawrence is an early Baroque building from the 17th century. In the town there is also the Bojskovsko Museum, focused on local folklore and traditions.
