Ağrı (Turkish pronunciation: [ɑːɾɯ]; Kurdish: Agirî; Armenian: Քարբեր, romanized: Karber) is a city in eastern Turkey, near the border with Iran. It is the seat of Ağrı Province and Ağrı District. Its population is 120,390 (2021). Formerly known as Karaköse (Kurdish: Qerekose) from the early Turkish republican period until 1946, and before that as Karakilise (Ottoman Turkish: قره‌کلیسا, romanized: Karakilisa, lit. 'Black Church'; Armenian: Ղարաքիլիսա, romanized: Gharakilisa), the city is now named after Ağrı, the Turkish name of Mount Ararat. The current town center was founded around 1860 by a group of Armenian merchants from Bitlis with the name Karakilise (قره‌کلیسا, lit. 'the black church') that became known to the local population as Karakise, and this version was turned officially to Karaköse at the beginning of the Republican era. This name was changed to Ağrı by 1946.[citation needed] In the years of 1927 to 1931, the region was under the occupation of the Kurdish separatist movements, which gained to establish an unrecognized state named Republic of Ararat which was led by several Kurdish leaders, some of the Main were Ibrahim Heski and Ihsan Nuri.[citation needed] In the medieval period, the district's administrative centre was located at Alashkert, once an important town. The "kara kilise" that gave the town its name was a medieval Armenian church. In 1895 H. F. B. Lynch stayed in Karakilise and wrote that it had between 1500 and 2000 inhabitants, was nearly two-thirds Armenian, and that a barracks for a locally recruited Kurdish Hamidiye regiment had been recently located in the town. The Armenian population of the town and surrounding valley was massacred during the Armenian Genocide: a New York Times report from March 1915 talks of the Alashkert valley being covered with the bodies of men, women, and children.
