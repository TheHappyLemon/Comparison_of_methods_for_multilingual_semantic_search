Monsters, Inc. (also known as Monsters, Incorporated) is a media franchise produced by Pixar and owned by The Walt Disney Company. The franchise takes place in a fictional universe where monsters are the primary citizens of a society and harness the energy of human children to power their cities. The company known as Monsters, Inc. accomplishes this with doors which lead to their bedroom closet doors. Monsters, Inc. introduces the monster world, where Monstropolis is powered by the screams of human children as monsters enter the human world at night and scare children through their bedroom closets. When a little girl called "Boo" accidentally enters the monster world, friends James P. Sullivan and Mike Wazowski must find a way to hide her from the authorities and return her to her world and, in the process, they learn that not everything they have been led to believe about humans is true. The film was released on November 2, 2001, in the United States, surpassing Toy Story 2 and peaked as the second highest-grossing animated film of all time, behind 1994's The Lion King at the time. It was one of the first animated films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature but lost to Shrek. A prequel to the first film, Monsters University tells Sulley and Mike's backstory. The future friends meet at college and initially start off as enemies, but end up on the same team in the university's "Scare Games", where they and their team of misfits must beat the odds and win the competition, or be expelled from school. As the team struggles, the two learn to work together, and slowly become best friends. The film was released on June 21, 2013 in the United States. Monsters at Work is a television series spin-off of Monsters, Inc. produced by Disney Television Animation for Disney+. It was announced in a Disney press release on November 9, 2017 as part of a list of in development series for The Walt Disney Company's then-upcoming streaming service.

On March 5, 2024, the second season is set to be released on April 5, 2024, on Disney Channel and May 5, 2024, on Disney+. The series begins the day after Monsters, Incorporated has switched to laugh power and follows a young eager mechanic, Tylor Tuskmon (Ben Feldman), who hopes to be promoted to the Laugh Floor alongside Mike and Sulley. Party Central is a six-minute short animated film, featuring characters from Monsters University. It premiered on August 9, 2013, at the D23 Expo. The short was set to be released theatrically with The Good Dinosaur in 2014, before the film was pushed back to 2015. Instead, it was theatrically released on March 21, 2014, with Muppets Most Wanted. The short was written and directed by Kelsey Mann, story supervisor on Monsters University. The cast consists of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Peter Sohn, Julia Sweeney, Charlie Day, Nathan Fillion, Dave Foley, Sean Hayes, Bobby Moynihan, and Joel Murray.

For unknown reasons, Disney declined to provide a budget for the film, although BoxOffice.com cites a budget of a total of $270 million. Entertainment Weekly speculated that it was higher than that of Brave ($185 million), mostly due to high cost of John Goodman and Billy Crystal reprising their roles. Shockya, a subsidiary website of CraveOnline, estimated the budget to be $200 million, on par with Toy Story 3 and Cars 2.
