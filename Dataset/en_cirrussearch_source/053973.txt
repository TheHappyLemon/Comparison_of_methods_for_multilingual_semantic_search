Intelsat 39, also known as IS-39, is a geostationary communications satellite operated by Intelsat and designed and manufactured by Space Systems/Loral (now subsidiary of Maxar Technologies) on the SSL 1300 satellite bus. It covers Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East from the 62° East longitude. It has a mixed C-band and Ku-band. Intelsat 39 was launched on August 6, 2019, on an Ariane 5 launch vehicle from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana, along with EDRS-C/HYLAS-3. From there, the satellite achieved its geostationary orbit by firing its main engine and was positioned at its position at 62° East, replacing Intelsat 902. Intelsat announced in May 2016 that they had commissioned the satellite manufacturer Space Systems/Loral to produce a modern communications satellite for their fleet. It has powerful C-band and Ku-band transponders, a projected lifespan of more than 15 years and is powered by two solar panels and batteries. It is also three-axis stabilized and weighs around 6,600 kilograms (14,600 pounds). For propulsion, the satellite has both chemical and electric thrusters, using only electric propulsion for in-orbit attitude control.
