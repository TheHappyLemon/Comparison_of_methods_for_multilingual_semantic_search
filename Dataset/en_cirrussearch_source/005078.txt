In 1986 he obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Automation from the School of Electrical Engineering at the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje. He was elected member of the Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia at the first multi-party elections in Yugoslavia in 1990 after serving for several years as head of department at the Semos company in Skopje. A former communist, Crvenkovski founded the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia in April 1991. On 5 September 1992, Crvenkovski became Macedonia's second prime minister after its secession from Yugoslavia and continued in the post for another four years following the December 1994 elections.

In 2005, on his initiative, the Albanian flag was legalized. Crvenkovski won the April 2004 presidential election against Saško Kedev and took office on 12 May 2004.
