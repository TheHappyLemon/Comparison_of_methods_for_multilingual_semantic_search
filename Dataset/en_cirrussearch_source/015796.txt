Raimondas Rumšas (born 14 January 1972) is a Lithuanian former professional road bicycle racer. He came third in the 2002 Tour de France but was implicated in a doping scandal. On the day of Rumšas' third-place finish in the 2002 Tour de France, police discovered corticoids, erythropoietin, testosterone, growth hormones and anabolic steroids in the car of his wife, Edita Rumšienė. She was jailed for several months before being released, despite her claim that the drugs were for her mother-in-law. In May 2003 Rumšas tested positive for the banned endurance enhancer erythropoietin (EPO). He had just finished the 2003 Giro d'Italia, where he ranked sixth. Rumšas received a one-year ban. He briefly returned to cycling in 2004 with Acqua & Sapone team for the Gran Premio Città di Camaiore. In June 2005, Rumšas was arrested before his trial by the Bonneville court. In January 2006, he and his wife received four-month suspended prison sentences for the import of prohibited doping substances. Polish doctor Krzysztof Ficek was handed a 12-month suspended sentence for prescribing the drugs. 1992 2nd Overall Tour de Pologne 1st Stage 3 1994 1st Overall Course de Solidarność et des Champions Olympiques 1996 3rd Overall Course de Solidarność et des Champions Olympiques 1st Stage 3 9th Overall Tour de Pologne 9th Route Adélie de Vitré 1997 4th Overall Course de Solidarność et des Champions Olympiques 1st Stage 5 9th Grote Prijs Jef Scherens 1998 National Road Championships 2nd Road race 3rd Time trial 2nd Overall Hessen Rundfahrt 1st Stage 4 4th Overall Course de Solidarność et des Champions Olympiques 5th Overall Tour de Pologne 7th Overall Peace Race 1st Stages 1 & 4 7th Lancaster Classic 9th Road race, UCI Road World Road Championships 1999 National Road Championships 1st Time trial 4th Road race 1st Stage 5 Circuit des Mines 2nd Overall Peace Race 1st Stage 3 3rd Overall Giro della Provincia di Lucca 4th Overall Tour de Pologne 1st Stages 6 & 7 5th Overall PruTour 1st Stage 4 2000 1st Giro di Lombardia 2nd Coppa Bernocchi 4th Overall Vuelta a Burgos 5th Overall Vuelta a España 5th Gran Premio Città di Camaiore 9th Overall Tour de Romandie 2001 National Road Championships 1st Road race 3rd Time trial 1st Overall Tour of the Basque Country 1st Stage 5b (ITT) 2nd Overall Paris–Nice 2nd Giro dell'Appennino 3rd Overall Giro del Trentino 3rd Overall Route du Sud 3rd Gran Premio di Chiasso 6th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 7th Overall Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 9th Trofeo Laigueglia 2002 2nd Overall Bicicleta Vasca 3rd Overall Tour de France 2003 1st Stage 1b (TTT) Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 6th Overall Giro d'Italia 2005 National Road Championships 1st Time trial 2nd Road race 2006 National Road Championships 2nd Road race 2nd Time trial Daley, Kieran (2002-07-31).
