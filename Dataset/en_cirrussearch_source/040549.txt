Fumiyuki Beppu (Japanese: 別府史之; born 10 April 1983) is a Japanese former professional road bicycle racer, who last rode for UCI WorldTeam EF Education–Nippo. His older brother is the cyclist Takumi Beppu. Beppu turned professional with Discovery Channel in 2005, and stayed with them until 2007. In June 2006, Beppu was crowned the Japanese national champion in both the time trial and the road race. On 28 September 2007, the Skil–Shimano professional cycling team announced that they had signed Beppu for an initial one-year contract. On 26 July 2009, Beppu, riding for Skil–Shimano, finished 112th out of 180 riders in the Tour de France. He won the Combativity award in the final 21st flat stage from Montereau-Fault-Yonne to Paris Champs-Élysées. He also placed 8th in stage 3 and 7th in stage 19. Along with Yukiya Arashiro, he became the first Japanese national to complete that race. Kisso Kawamuro and Daisuke Imanaka had started but not finished the race before. On 23 November 2009, it was announced Beppu had signed to ride with Team RadioShack for the 2010 season. Later it became clear that Beppu still had one year left on his contract with Skil-Shimano, so he had to buy himself out of the contract. In February 2010 he finally started races with RadioShack at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and Kuurne-Bruxelles-Kuurne. In October 2011, it was announced that Beppu would ride for the new Australian based team GreenEDGE. He participated in the men's road race at the 2012 Summer Olympics and finished in 22nd place. After two years with the team, Beppu left at the end of the 2013 season to join Trek Factory Racing. He was named in the startlist for the 2016 Vuelta a España. 2000 1st Time trial, National Junior Road Championships 2001 1st Road race, Asian Junior Road Championships 1st Road race, National Junior Road Championships 2003 1st Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships 1st Stage 1 Giro della Valle d'Aosta Mont Blanc 2004 1st Stage 1 Giro della Valle d'Aosta Mont Blanc 1st Mountains classification Ronde de l'Isard 3rd Overall Tour du Loir-et-Cher 2006 National Road Championships 1st Road race 1st Time trial Asian Games 4th Time trial 9th Road race 2007 10th Overall Driedaagse van West-Vlaanderen 2008 1st Road race, Asian Road Championships 2009 1st Mountains classification Route du Sud Combativity award Stage 21 Tour de France 2010 4th Châteauroux Classic 10th Overall Driedaagse van West-Vlaanderen 2011 National Road Championships 1st Road race 1st Time trial 6th Grand Prix d'Isbergues 8th GP Ouest–France 2012 1st Stage 2 (TTT) Eneco Tour 2nd Japan Cup Criterium 2013 5th Japan Cup Criterium 2014 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 4th Time trial, Asian Games 2015 1st Japan Cup Criterium 2016 1st Japan Cup Criterium 3rd Road race, Asian Road Championships Combativity award Stage 18 Vuelta a España 2017 2nd Road race, National Road Championships 4th Road race, Asian Road Championships 2018 Asian Road Championships 1st Team time trial 2nd Road race 4th Time trial Asian Games 2nd Road race 3rd Time trial 2019 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships "Fumiyuki Beppu – Trek Factory Racing".
