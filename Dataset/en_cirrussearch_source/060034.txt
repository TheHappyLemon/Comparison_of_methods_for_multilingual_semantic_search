Sing is an American media franchise created by Garth Jennings and produced by Illumination.

The first film, Sing, was released on December 21, 2016, and received positive reviews from critics. The second film, Sing 2, was released on December 22, 2021. The series has grossed $1 billion worldwide. The franchise takes place in a world inhabited by talking, anthropomorphic animals. It follows a koala named Buster Moon who, with the help of other animals, puts on live theater shows that largely encompass singing. In an attempt to save his theater, a koala named Buster Moon decides to hold a singing competition to get it out of debt. Buster Moon and his gang now have their sights set on debuting a new show at the Crystal Tower Theater in glamorous Redshore City. But without connections, he and his singers must convince the ruthless media mogul Jimmy Crystal and pitch the idea of casting the legendary rock star Clay Calloway in their show. Buster must embark on a quest to find the now-reclusive Clay and persuade him to return to the stage. In April 2023, it was announced that a third film was in development.
