Axiom Mission 3 (or Ax-3) was a private spaceflight to the International Space Station. The flight launched on 18 January 2024, and lasted for 21 days, successfully splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean. It was operated by Axiom Space and used a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The booster, B1080, had previously flown Axiom-2, among other high-profile missions. All four crewmembers have backgrounds as military pilots. Michael López-Alegría was the commander as an employee of Axiom; Walter Villadei from the Italian Air Force was the mission pilot. The mission specialists were Alper Gezeravcı who was the first astronaut from Turkey; and Swedish project astronaut Marcus Wandt ("project astronaut" is ESA's designation for an astronaut assigned to a project), who was the first member of the 2022 European Space Agency Astronaut Group to receive a spaceflight mission. It was also the first commercial spaceflight mission for an ESA sponsored astronaut. Wandt's component of the mission is called "Muninn" as it overlaps with fellow Scandinavian ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen's mission – "Huginn". The crew lifted off on a Falcon 9 from LC-39A Florida to dock with the International Space Station for an intended mission duration of approximately two weeks. Final mission duration was 21 days; mission ended with a splashdown into the Atlantic Ocean on 9 February 2024.
