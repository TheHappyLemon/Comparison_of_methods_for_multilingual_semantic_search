The 2014–15 Turkish Airlines Euroleague was the 15th season of the modern era of EuroLeague basketball and the fifth under the title sponsorship of the Turkish Airlines. Including the competition's previous iteration as the FIBA Europe Champions Cup, this was the 58th season of the premier competition for European men's clubs. The city of Madrid hosted the Final Four from May 15 to 17, 2015. There were three routes to participation in the Euroleague: The 12 teams with an A-Licence from the 2013–14 Euroleague, based on their Euroleague Club Ranking. The 2013–14 Eurocup winner was given a C-Licence. The rest of the teams places were allocated from a list of 28 teams given a B-Licence ranked according to their European national basketball league rankings over the last year. 13 teams were given both an A-Licence or C-Licence and a B-Licence. When a country ranking spot had already been assigned to an A-Licence team, the assignation jumped to the next country appearing in the ranking, and their league was not granted an additional place in the competition. At least the first 9 of the remaining 16 teams were given places in the regular-season, and the next 6 were given places in the qualifying competition. If the Eurocup champion was qualified by receiving a B licence or some team with it resigned from the competition, a wild card had to be given by the Euroleague. The Euroleague had the right to cancel an A licence for one of the following reasons: The club had the lowest ranking of all clubs with an A Licence, according to the Club Ranking. The club had ranked among the clubs placed in the bottom half of the national championship final standings. The club had financial problems. In Spanish League, when the champion and/or the runner-up of the league were teams without an A licence. In that case, the A licence club with the lowest position would play in Eurocup in the next season. If that happened three times in five years, the A licence of the club would have been cancelled. Classification after the 2013–14 Euroleague, including also the 2011–12 and the 2012–13 seasons. The A licence of EA7 Milano expired in June 2014, but Euroleague confirmed it as an A licensed team. Montepaschi Siena did not play in the Euroleague, due to financial troubles. B licences could be given to every team without an A licence. If in the allocation appeared a team with A licence, the next team in the criteria would receive the B licence, which qualified directly to the Regular Season.
