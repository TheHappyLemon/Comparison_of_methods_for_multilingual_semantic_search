René Ressejac-Duparc (28 September 1880 – 19 April 1941) was a French footballer who played as a midfielder and who competed in the 1900 Olympic Games, winning a silver medal as a member of the USFSA team, which was primarily Club Français players. With Club Français, he reached the finals of the 1900 Challenge International du Nord, and the 1899 and 1900 Championnat de Paris [fr], and won the Coupe Manier [fr] three consecutive times at the turn of the century between 1899 and 1901. Duparc began his career playing at U.S. Puteaux before joining Club Français when he was eighteen, in 1898. His mentor was said to be Club Français midfielder Alfred Bloch. On 29 April 1900, Club Français faced Le Havre AC in the final of the 1900 Challenge International du Nord at Tourcoing, which ended in a 2–3 loss. A match summary in L'Auto of a 16 October 1900 game wrote that he was a change to the team's midfield, but as "a good player who knows his job", it marked an improvement. Duparc continued in the midfield when the team began competing in the Paris championship, the top-level division tournament, later that month, playing in all but one match (during which his absence, despite replacement, was noted). The team confidently won all their games. Continuing to see success in the tournament, L'Auto noted that Duparc was one of the youngest players on the team and that he showed a lot of promise but was already "a good player, very resistant, very tough". He played in the final against Standard Athletic Club, but was injured in the first half as the match ended in a 1–1 draw. Duparc was also in the winning Club Français line-up, playing in each match, for the 1900 Coupe Manier, which took place later in December. After winning the Coupe Manier, Club Français's first (including Duparc) and second teams played international friendlies against Croydon and their reserves. Duparc's performance in this match was praised, with his intelligent ball-passing in the first half said to break up Croydon attacks and his "beautiful" passes to the team's forwards in the second half often drawing applause; it ended in a 3–3 draw. On 6 January 1901, Club Français faced Standard Athletic Club again, this time in the preliminary rounds of the 1901 Challenge International du Nord, which ended in a 0–1 loss. With the referee getting lost in the game, the play turned brutal, mostly perpetrated by Standard Athletic Club, who targeted the Club Français midfielders; Bloch was kicked so hard in the stomach that he had to go off, while Duparc along with Louis Bach and Cuny were "badly hit". Club Français wrote a letter of complaint to the football association. Duparc's misfortune continued; when travelling to compete in another match in January 1901, a group called la bande noire burgled him, taking his shoes and bag. In the 1901 Championnat de Paris, Duparc began playing as a forward again, still with Club Français. Duparc was listed as a forward for the USFSA (French amateur) team, composed mostly of Club Français players, at the 1900 Olympic Games. He was not selected for the opening match against Upton Park on 20 September, which ended in a humiliating 0–4 loss, so Duparc was then picked up for the second match three days later, helping his side to a 6–2 victory over Belgium, which was mostly made up of students from the French-speaking Université libre de Bruxelles; the authors of four of these goals are unknown, so Duparc, who started as a forward alongside teammates Georges Garnier and Gaston Peltier, might have scored at least one of them. The French team came second and Duparc was thus awarded with a silver medal. Duparc died in Pornic on 19 April 1941, at the age of 60. Duparc remained practically unknown and of uncertain identity for several decades since he was only cited in the database of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as a "medalist for France in football" in 1900. No first name and not the slightest additional information until the truth was uncovered by an investigation carried out by Stéphane Gachet from Nantes in the wake of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. By searching the database of the French Olympic Committee, he obtained a crucial additional initial R. Duparc, from which he ended up finding traces of a René Duparc, but he was then unable to find any trace of his places of birth and death. It was finally on a website presenting lists of genealogical records that Gachet discovered the existence of a René Ressejac-Duparc, who had been born in 1880, lived in Puteaux, and was employed at the Banque de France. He first linked Duparc to Loire-Atlantique through his mother, originally from Châteaubriant, but then he discovered the existence of a secondary house in Pornic, where he died in 1941, "perhaps to take refuge during the war?". Gachet then contacted his grandson, Patrick Ressejac-Duparc, who lived in Portugal with his wife, to tell him that his grandfather was an Olympic medalist. This discovery was then made public with the publishing of the book "all the French medalists from 1896 to the present day" in December 2023, "a beautiful bible" of 623 pages with more than 300 photos.
