This is a complete list of cities in Ukraine. As of 1 January 2022, there are 461 cities (Ukrainian: місто, romanized: misto) in Ukraine. City status is granted by the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. The city status is only partially related to the size of a populated place in Ukraine. Smaller settlements are towns (Ukrainian: селище, romanized: selyshche) and villages (Ukrainian: село, romanized: selo). Historically, there were systems of city rights, granted by the territorial lords, which defined the status of a place as a misto or selo. In the past, cities were self-governing and had several privileges.[citation needed] The list of cities is roughly ordered by population and the 2022 estimates are compared to the 2001 Ukrainian census, except for Chernobyl for which the population is an unofficial estimate. The cities with special status are shown in italic. Jump to table of cities Controlled by the Donetsk People's Republic since the War in Donbas.
