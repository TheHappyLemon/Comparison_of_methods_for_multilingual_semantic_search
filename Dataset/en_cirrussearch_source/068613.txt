Last Looks is a 2022 American-British mystery film, directed by Tim Kirkby, from a screenplay by Howard Michael Gould based on his novel of the same name. It stars Charlie Hunnam, Mel Gibson, Morena Baccarin, Lucy Fry, Rupert Friend, Dominic Monaghan, Jacob Scipio and Clancy Brown. After spending three years without human contact in a remote trailer, former Detective Charlie Waldo returns to Los Angeles to investigate the murder of actor Alistair Pinch‘s wife. Initially unwilling to take the case, he agrees to stay for one day after his ex-girlfriend Lorena went missing. After Alistair is arrested as the prime suspect, Charlie is lured back to his trailer by gangster Don Q, who claims that Lorena secretly stashed a “mem“ in the trailer. He gives Charlie an ultimatum: to retrieve the mem within 24 hours. Charlie deduces that Alistair‘s wife was killed with one of his missing acting awards and that furniture at the crime scene was moved, casting doubts on the theory believed by the police. The police reveal to him that Lorena was seemingly killed over the mem and fixer Warren Gomes attempts to pressure him of the case. Charlie storms a party hosted by billionaire Darius Jamshidi, Gomes‘s employer. The next day, Charlie confronts Don Q over Lorena‘s murder, but is knocked out by his henchman. He received a message from Lorena, who faked her death and hid the “mem”, a memory stick, on his property. Charlie deduces that both men ordering attacks him, Jamshidi and gangsta rapper Swag Doggg, have kids in the same class as Alistair. He finds out that all three men had affairs with nymphomaniac school teacher Jayne White and attack him to keep it secret, while Alistair even got her pregnant. Charlie has now deduced the real killer: Wilson Sikorsky, Alistair‘s boss and his employer. He had an affair with Alistair‘s wife and killed her after she threatened to tell Alistair about the affair and force him to move back to England with her. He hired Charlie because he thought the disgraced detective wouldn’t uncover the mystery and make Alistair take the Fall. After Gomes blackmailed him, he killed him, too. Sikorsky flees but is killed by Q, who reveals that on the memory stick is an epic poem he wrote. Charlie and Lorena reunite.
