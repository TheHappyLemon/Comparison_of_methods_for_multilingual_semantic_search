This article documents notable spaceflight events during the year 2019. The Russian-German X-ray observing satellite Spektr-RG was launched on 13 July. The Chinese probe Chang'e 4 made humanity's first soft landing on the far side of the Moon on 3 January and released its Yutu 2 rover to explore the lunar surface on the far side for the first time in human history. Israel's SpaceIL, one of the participants in the expired Google Lunar X Prize, launched the first private mission to the Moon in February. The Beresheet lander from SpaceIL made the landing attempt in April, but crashed onto the Moon. India launched the delayed Chandrayaan-2 lunar orbiter/lander/rover in July; the orbiter reached lunar orbit in September, but the Vikram lander crashed onto the lunar surface. The probe New Horizons encountered the Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth on 1 January. This is the farthest object from the Sun ever to have a close encounter with a spacecraft. The Japanese asteroid exploration mission Hayabusa2 made a second touchdown with 162173 Ryugu to collect samples, and departed for Earth on 12 November. NASA declared the Mars rover Opportunity's mission over on 13 February. The InSight lander observed the first recorded Marsquake in April. The first Commercial Crew Development test missions flew this year, aiming to restore United States human spaceflight capability following Space Shuttle retirement in 2011. In an uncrewed test flight, SpaceX SpaceX Dragon 2 successfully flew on a Falcon 9 to the International Space Station on 3 March 2019; the crewed mission was delayed when the recovered capsule exploded during testing on 20 April. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner launched a similar uncrewed test flight on an Atlas V on 20 December, but an anomaly during launch meant that it could not reach the ISS and had to land only 2 days later. At the beginning of the year, around 100 small satellite launchers were in active use, in development, or were recently cancelled or stalled. Three Chinese manufacturers launched their first orbital rocket in 2019: The maiden flight of OS-M1 in March failed to reach orbit, the maiden flights of Hyperbola-1 in July and of Jielong 1 in August were successful. The PSLV-DL and PSLV-QL variants of the Indian PSLV first flew in January and April respectively. SpaceX began testing of the SpaceX Starship in 2019, with an uncrewed prototype "Starhopper" flying 150m in the air in a suborbital test flight on 27 August. The heavy-lift Long March 5 made its return to flight in December, more than two years after the July 2017 launch failure that grounded the vehicle and forced an engine redesign. The "single stick" Delta IV was retired in August, and the analog-controlled Soyuz-FG was retired in September. Due to Ukraine banning control system exports to Russia, Rokot was retired after a final flight in December. No fragments have entered the SSN catalog as 2/4/20 Due to difficulties in tracking objects in deep space elliptical orbits it is unknown how many fragments were generated For the purposes of this section, the yearly tally of orbital launches by country assigns each flight to the country of origin of the rocket, not to the launch services provider or the spaceport. For example, Soyuz launches by Arianespace in Kourou are counted under Russia because Soyuz-2 is a Russian rocket. 5 10 15 20 25 30 Antares Ariane Atlas Delta Electron Falcon Kuaizhou Long March PSLV R-7 UR Vega Others   Antares 230+   Ariane 5   Atlas V   Delta IV   Delta IV Heavy   Electron   Falcon 9 new   Falcon 9 reused   Falcon Heavy   Kuaizhou 1A   Long March 2   Long March 3   Long March 4   Long March 5   Long March 6   Long March 11   PSLV   Soyuz-FG   Soyuz-2 (Russia)   Soyuz-ST (Europe)   Proton-M   Rokot   Vega   Others 8 16 24 32 40 China France India Iran Japan Kazakhstan New Zealand Russia United States   Jiuquan   Taiyuan   Wenchang   Xichang   Yellow Sea   Kourou   Satish Dhawan   Semnan   Tanegashima   Uchinoura   Baikonur   Mahia   Plesetsk   Vostochny   Cape Canaveral   Kennedy   MARS   Vandenberg 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Low Earth Medium Earth / Molniya Geosynchronous / transfer High Earth Heliocentric   Low Earth   Low Earth (ISS)   Low Earth (SSO)   Medium Earth   Molniya   Geosychronous (transfer)   Inclined GSO   High Earth   Heliocentric Clockwise from top: The Yutu-2 rover successfully operational on the far side of the Moon after the Chang'e 4 lander achieved humanity's first landing on the far side. LightSail 2 deploys its solar sail in low Earth orbit in July. The mission, funded by The Planetary Society, successfully demonstrated propulsion using radiation pressure on its 32 m2 (340 sq ft) "sail". Launch of a boilerplate Orion capsule, during the Ascent Abort-2 mission in July. The mission successfully tested the capability of Orion's upgraded launch escape system ahead of the Artemis program. The first ever Crew Dragon capsule arrives at the International Space Station uncrewed, during Crew Dragon Demo-1 in March. The mission was the first in a series of test flights of Crew Dragon and the Boeing Starliner ahead of the Commercial Crew Program. Grush, Loren (31 March 2018).
