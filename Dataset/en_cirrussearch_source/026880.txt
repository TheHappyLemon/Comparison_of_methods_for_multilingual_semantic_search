The General José de San Martín Airport (IATA: PSS, ICAO: SARP), at coordinates 27°22′S 55°58′W﻿ / ﻿27.367°S 55.967°W﻿ / -27.367; -55.967, is seven kilometres from the city, and features regular flights to Buenos Aires. Father Roque González y de Santa Cruz established a town called Anunciación de Itapúa on 25 March 1615, but ten years later the settlement was moved to the other side of the Paraná River to the present location of Encarnación, Paraguay. The first settlement was not completely abandoned, and a new San José reduction was settled there in 1628. In 1867, during the Paraguayan War, the Brazilians set up the Trinchera de San José military base there. Following the end of the war, Paraguay renounced all claims to the area, and in 1879, the town was renamed after Gervasio Antonio de Posadas, the Supreme Director of the Argentine Confederation (1814). On 22 December 1881, the limits of the Misiones Federation were drawn, leaving Posadas within the territory of current Corrientes Province. On 30 July 1884 the National Congress decided to give Posadas to Misiones Province, and name it its capital. The National University of Misiones was established at Posadas in 1973, and in 1990, the city's cultural and economic links to Encarnación were strengthened with the completion of the San Roque González de Santa Cruz Bridge.
