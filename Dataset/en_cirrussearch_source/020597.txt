Advent is a Boston, Massachusetts spin-out from TA Associates by Peter Brooke.

In 1987, the firm raised the $225 million International Network Fund, its first institutional private equity fund.

Advent's founder, Peter Brooke, stepped down as the firm's CEO in 1996, but remained active as the company's chairman. Through the 2000s, Advent's expansion accelerated as the firm raised additional funds for its various fund families and opening new offices in Europe and Asia. Advent's sixth global private equity fund, raised in 2008, closed with €6.6 billion of investor commitments and the firm raised an additional €1 billion for investments in central Europe.

Advent bought a majority ownership of Bradco Supply, a leading distributor of building products in 2008. It has acquired a number of companies in Central and Eastern Europe through its dedicated regional funds. These include Romanian Ceramica IASI, one of Romania’s leading ceramic bricks and clay roof tiles producers, Bolix, a leading Polish producer of construction chemicals, Dufa Deutek, Romania’s largest decorative paints producer, and LaborMed Pharma, which manufactures and distributes generic pharmaceuticals primarily for cardiovascular and central nervous system ailments. In 2007, its Asia affiliate Seavi Advent led the restructuring of Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, one of China's largest privately owned shipbuilders, and successfully listed the company on the Singapore Exchange; making it one of the largest IPOs by a foreign company in Singapore. In March 2009, Advent announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in Fifth Third Processing Solutions, the payment processing business of Fifth Third Bank in a $2.35 billion transaction. The transaction represented one of the largest private equity transactions completed in 2009, amidst the Financial crisis of 2007–2010. The deal was completed in June 2009. In November 2009, it announced a public tender offer to acquire 100% of Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagogiczne S.A. (WSiP), the largest Polish educational publisher. In April 2010, it took over the company DFS in the United Kingdom. In August 2010, Advent International was credited with spawning the takeover of Mexicana Airlines by an outside investor group. Advent International has no equity investment stakes in the takeover according to published sources. In 2011, it acquired Mondo Minerals, the second largest global talc producer and British mental health care provider, Priory Group, best known for providing mental health treatments to celebrities such as Eric Clapton and Johnny Depp. In August 2011, it acquired Bojangles' Famous Chicken 'n Biscuits, a regional chain of quick-service restaurants based in Charlotte, North Carolina.

On August 7, 2014, lululemon athletica inc. and Wilson facilitated Advent's re-engagement in lululemon by selling 13.85% ownership in the company to Advent for approximately $845 million. The transaction received the full support of the lululemon Board of Directors and changes the board dynamic. Advent Managing Partner David M. Mussafer and Managing Director Steven J. Collins will be appointed to lululemon's Board of Directors, expanding the Board from 10 to 12 members. Mr. Mussafer will now share Chairman responsibilities with Michael Casey. Lululemon will also engage an independent expert to evaluate and make recommendations regarding the lululemon Board's committees, policies and procedures over the course of 90 days following the completion of Advent's stock purchase. In November 2014, Advent completed a new $2.1 billion private equity fund, its Advent Latin American Private Equity Fund VI, thought to be the largest ever raised for Latin America. Advent International also acquired a significant minority ownership of Noosa Yoghurt, a Bellevue-based company, for an undisclosed amount. Between 2016 and 2018, it acquired business-to-business distributors of industrial supplies Brammer and IPH Group to create Rubix. In February 2017, it announced that it would partner with CCC Information Services as their sole equity partner, buying out Leonard Green & Partners and TPG Capital. On May 31, 2017, Advent and Bpifrance completed the acquisition of Safran Identity & Security (Morpho, now renamed IDEMIA), after receiving clearance from antitrust and regulatory authorities. " Didier Lamouche was appointed President of the Executive Board and Marwan Lahoud Chairman of the Supervisory Board of OT-MORPHO. This acquisition raised a series of concerns: Various civil rights organizations have criticized the government's contracts with IDEMIA, expressing concerns about sharing sensitive biometric data with a private and unregulated third-party company. Researchers have also found that facial verification and identification algorithms, including IDEMIA's algorithm specifically, exhibit systematic racial and gender bias. Another concern is the presence of Marwan Lahoud as a President or member of the board of different entities of the group, since 2017. Marwan Lahoud abruptly left Airbus (former EADS) in February 2017, without notice, and is deeply involved in the scandal of corruption which hit Airbus. "Airbus ran 'massive' bribery scheme to win orders" (title of the article in the Financial Times of January 31, 2020 in which he is mentioned, with a photo of him with this title: "Marwan Lahoud, who led the strategy organization and marketing of Airbus, SMO, a division dedicated to securing sales in emerging markets and at the heart of a catalog of offenses."). In January 2020, the French press announced that the French, British and American courts had validated the agreements made earlier this week by Airbus and the French National Financial Prosecutor's Office (PNF), the British Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the Department of Justice ( DOJ) in the United States, under which the European group AIRBUS recognises the fraud and briberies, and undertakes to pay fines totalling 3.6 billion euros: 2.08 billion in France as part of a public interest legal agreement (CJIP ), 984 million in the United Kingdom and 526 million in the United States. Today dissolved, the group's unit called Strategy and Marketing Organization (SMO), led by Marwan Lahoud, was at the heart of the matter. Almost all the articles published on these agreements underline that the ex-leaders may be worried within the framework of a preliminary investigation still in progress. In October 2018, Advent acquired the pharmaceutical company Zentiva, previously owned by Sanofi. On December 20, 2019, the UK government approved Advent's £4 billion takeover of defense supplier Cobham Plc. On July 24, 2019, the firm announced the 165p in cash for each Cobham shares, takeover of the firm. On September 16, 2019, at a shareholders' meeting in London, the proposed takeover deal was approved with 93% voting in favor of the deal, surpassing the requisite 75% votes. The takeover was controversial, with opponents of the deal, such as the former First Sea Lord and Royal Navy chief Admiral Lord West expressing fears. The founding family of Cobham were also vocal opponents of the takeover. These oppositions for the takeover triggered an investigation by the Competition & Markets Authority, on the national security implications of the transaction, which led to the delay in the regulatory approval of the deal. The company is following up its $3.3 billion acquisition of Evonik Industries's plastics division. On December 16, 2022, the geospatial intelligence company Maxar Technologies announced it had been acquired by Advent International for $6.4 billion. Gottfried, Miriam (December 16, 2022).
