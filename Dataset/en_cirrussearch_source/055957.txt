Milne Land or Milneland is a large island in eastern Greenland. It is the third largest island of Greenland, after the main island of Greenland and Disko Island. It is named after British admiral David Milne. This island is popular among climbers. The island is 113 km (70 mi) long from Moræne Point in the southwest to Bregne Point in the northeast, up to 45 km (28 mi) wide, and 3,913 km2 (1,511 sq mi) in area. It is part of an archipelago, which includes Storo and Sorte Island in the Northwest, Denmark Island in the south, and the Bjorne Islands in the northeast. Cape Leslie is Milneland's southeastern headland. Milne Land is separated from the Renland peninsula in the north by the 6 to 10 km (6.2 mi) wide Ofjord, from the Gaaseland peninsula in the south by the 4 to 6 km (3.7 mi) wide Fonfjord, and from the mainland coast in the west by the 4 to 14 km (8.7 mi) wide Rode Fjord.
