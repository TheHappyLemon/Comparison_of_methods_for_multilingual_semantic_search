In a positive review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the project "erratic, sometimes transfixingly so", stating that "Playboi Carti's album takes hip-hop's ad-lib era to its logical extreme — everything sounds like an ad-lib, even the main lyrics." In a more negative review, HipHopDX critic Narshima Chintaluri described the record as "simply a glorified beat tape with ad-libs", stating Carti "need[s] to further develop his songwriting in order to maintain this allure alongside his more successful contemporaries." Brian Duricy of PopMatters described the record as "the sonic equivalent of the stereotypical laissez-faire worker who breezes through presentations on sheer personality alone", stating that "over the production, however, you're not getting particularly much." Pitchfork's Briana Younger wrote that "Playboi Carti feels like a break from life, the soundtrack to a mindless good time," and adding that "Carti is tactful in discerning where and when he can get away with letting the instrumental ride and when he needs to rise to the occasion." The single "Magnolia" was awarded Best New Track by Pitchfork. The mixtape appeared on 2017 year-end album lists by publications such as Fact, Pitchfork, and Tiny Mix Tapes. John Twells of Fact stated that the project "adeptly taps into a widespread youthful malaise and the genre-fluid playlist culture that has come to dominate rap's mainstream [...] Sad and restless but also party-ready, Playboi Carti doesn't need political rambling or conscious posturing to get its message across." Corrigan B of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that "of everything that 2017 promised about rap's future, Playboi Carti felt the most like a real path forward, a crystallization of the SoundCloud underground's zeitgeist in a format built to transcend the scene's messy adolescence." Playboi Carti debuted at number 12 on the US Billboard 200, with 28,000 album-equivalent units, of which 21,000 were streaming units and 7,000 were pure album sales. As of September 2017, the mixtape has moved over 367,000 units. The mixtape was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 10, 2018 for sales over 500,000 units. Credits adapted from the album's liner notes and ASCAP.
