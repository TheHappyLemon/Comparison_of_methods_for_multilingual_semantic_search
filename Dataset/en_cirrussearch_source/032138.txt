Adam Hansen (born 11 May 1981) is an Australian Ironman triathlete and professional road bicycle racer, who currently rides for UCI Continental team WSA KTM Graz p/b Leomo. In March 2023 he was elected President of the Cyclistes Professionnels Associés (CPA), an international non-profit association that safeguards the interests of the professional riders, becoming the first CPA president born outside Europe. Hansen was born in Southport, Queensland, and turned professional in 2007, working with Dr. Lothar Heinrich of the University of Freiburg. In 2012, Hansen became the second Australian to complete all three Grand Tours – the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España – in a calendar year. He was the only rider to accomplish that feat in 2012, and the 32nd in cycling history. It was after Stage 12 of the Giro that he discovered he had broken his sternum approximately two weeks previous, however since it was healing; he continued racing. While he had free rein at the Giro, for the Tour he had worked for André Greipel (to win sprints) and Jurgen Van den Broeck (to achieve a good General Classification position). In 2013, Hansen broke away early in the seventh stage of the Giro d'Italia, a stage featuring numerous short and steep climbs. Hansen shed his breakaway companions and won in solo fashion in Pescara in pouring rain, more than a minute in advance of the chasing group. In stage 19 of the 2014 Vuelta a España, Hansen attacked the peloton with 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) to go and resisted the disorganised chase to win solo. In completing the 2015 Vuelta a España, his thirteenth grand tour in a row, he broke Bernardo Ruiz's 57-year-old record for consecutive grand tours completed. By completing the 2018 Giro d'Italia, he extended his own record becoming the only rider to complete 20 consecutive Grand Tours. The streak ended at 20, as Hansen did not take part in the 2018 Tour de France. As an engineer[citation needed] Hansen has designed his own shoes and ridden with them on numerous occasions. He has also written software for his Lotto–Soudal team, which manages their logistics. After Lotto–Soudal opted not to extend Hansen's contract beyond the end of 2020, in October of that year he announced that he would focus on Ironman Triathlons in 2021, having previously competed in Ironman Florida in 2019. He ended his World Tour cycling career having finished 26 Grand Tours of the 29 he started. In 2022, Hansen signed for Austrian Continental team WSA KTM Graz. He has been living in Frýdlant nad Ostravicí, Czech Republic since 2005.
