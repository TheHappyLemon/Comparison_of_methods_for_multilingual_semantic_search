The 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup, the second edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup, was held in Sweden and won by Norway, who became the first European nation to win the Women's World Cup. The tournament featured 12 women's national teams from six continental confederations. The 12 teams were drawn into three groups of four and each group played a round-robin tournament. At the end of the group stage, the top two teams and two best third-ranked teams advanced to the knockout stage, beginning with the quarter-finals and culminating with the final at Råsunda Stadium on 18 June 1995. Sweden became the first country to host both men's and women's World Cup, having hosted the men's in 1958. Australia, Canada, and England made their debuts in the competition. The tournament also hosted as qualification for the 1996 Summer Olympics, with the eight quarter-finalists being invited to the Olympics. In the second edition of the Women's World Cup, matches were lengthened to the standard 90 minutes, and three points were awarded for a win. Bulgaria was originally awarded hosting rights for the tournament, but had to relinquish the rights and FIFA ended up awarding the tournament to Sweden. About 112,000 tickets were sold for the entire tournament. As a FIFA rules experiment, each team was allowed a two-minute time out each half. Norway won the 1995 title, with one in four Norwegians watching the game on television. Norway's team plane was escorted back to Oslo by two F-16s on their way to a victory celebration. As in the previous edition of the FIFA Women's World cup, held in 1991, 12 teams participated in the final tournament. The teams were: For a list of the squads that competed in the final tournament, see 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup squads. Notes Also served as an assistant referee for one match.

The draw was conducted by Sepp Blatter, then the FIFA General Secretary, and assisted by Swedish internationals Tomas Brolin and Kristin Bengtsson, winners of the 1994 Guldbollen and Diamantbollen, respectively. There was no television coverage of the draw.

Denmark's opening 5–0 win over Australia, in which Sonia Gegenhuber was sent off in the 45th minute for the Aussies, ultimately led to their securing one of the best third place runner up spots as they would lose their next two matches. United States goalkeeper Brianna Scurry was sent off in the 88th minute of the second group game against Denmark. With all three substitutions used, U.S. manager Tony DiCicco called upon striker Mia Hamm to play goalkeeper. Hamm made two saves over eight minutes of stoppage time to secure the 2–0 win. In the other game, Angela Iannotta scored Australia's first-ever World Cup goal, but China defeated the Matildas 4–2. 6 June 1995 (1995-06-06) 19:00 Strömvallen, Gävle Attendance: 4,635 Referee: Ingrid Jonsson (Sweden) 6 June 1995 (1995-06-06) 19:00 Arosvallen, Västerås Attendance: 1,500 Referee: Bente Skogvang (Norway) 8 June 1995 (1995-06-08) 19:00 Strömvallen, Gävle Attendance: 2,704 Referee: Engage Camara (Guinea) 8 June 1995 (1995-06-08) 19:00 Arosvallen, Västerås Attendance: 1,500 Referee: Maria Edilene Siqueira (Brazil) 10 June 1995 (1995-06-10) 16:00 Olympia, Helsingborg Attendance: 1,105 Referee: Pirom Un-prasert (Thailand) 10 June 1995 (1995-06-10) 16:00 Arosvallen, Västerås Attendance: 1,619 Referee: Eduardo Gamboa (Chile) Source: FIFA Rules for classification: 1) Points; 2) Goal difference; 3) Goals scored. 13 June 1995 (1995-06-13) 17:15 Strömvallen, Gävle Attendance: 3,756 Referee: Eduardo Gamboa (Chile) 13 June 1995 (1995-06-13) 17:15 Tingvalla IP, Karlstad Attendance: 4,655 Referee: Pirom Un-prasert (Thailand) 13 June 1995 (1995-06-13) 20:15 Arosvallen, Västerås Attendance: 2,317 Referee: Bente Skogvang (Norway) 13 June 1995 (1995-06-13) 20:15 Olympia, Helsingborg Attendance: 7,537 Referee: Sonia Denoncourt (Canada) 15 June 1995 (1995-06-15) 17:15 Arosvallen, Västerås Attendance: 2,893 Referee: Alain Hamer (Luxembourg) 15 June 1995 (1995-06-15) 20:15 Olympia, Helsingborg Attendance: 3,693 Referee: Petros Mathabela (South Africa) 17 June 1995 (1995-06-17) 16:00 Strömvallen, Gävle Attendance: 4,335 Referee: Sonia Denoncourt (Canada) 18 June 1995 (1995-06-18) 18:00 Råsunda Stadium, Solna Attendance: 17,158 Referee: Ingrid Jonsson (Sweden) The following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament: There were 99 goals scored in 26 matches, for an average of 3.81 goals per match.
