The Slovene Wikipedia (Slovene: slovenska Wikipedija) is the Slovene-language edition of the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia. It has been active since 26 February 2002. On 15 August 2010, it reached 100,000 articles. As of March 2024, it has about 185,000 articles. Wikipedia is a widely used reference work and one of the most visited social networking services by users from Slovenia, but official internet usage statistics do not distinguish between Wikipedia editions, analyzing only the base domain wikipedia.org. In most cases, the Slovene-language edition gets a passing note of its existence in media reports about Wikipedia in general. However, as a relatively large and freely accessible body of structured knowledge, Slovene Wikipedia has been used, as an example, for building text corpora for the purpose of training linguistic software and analyzing Slovene literary authors' web presence. There are several successful collaboration projects with professors at the University of Ljubljana, using content creation by students as a teaching method. Active Wikipedians from Slovenia have also been featured in discussions about Wikipedia (both general and Slovene-language specific) in national media. 100 articles - June 18, 2002 1,000 articles - September 30, 2003 10,000 articles - February 7, 2005 20,000 articles - December 17, 2005 30,000 articles - June 30, 2006 40,000 articles - February 15, 2007 50,000 articles - July 17, 2007 100,000 articles - August 15, 2010 150,000 articles - March 31, 2016 "RIS: Najbolj obiskana spletna skupnost v Sloveniji je Youtube, sledita ji Facebook in Wikipedia".
