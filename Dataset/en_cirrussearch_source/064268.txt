Jurriën David Norman Timber (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈjʏri(j)ən ˈtɪmbər]; born 17 June 2001) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a defender for Premier League club Arsenal and the Netherlands national team. Mainly a centre-back, he can also play as a full-back. Timber joined Ajax's youth academy in 2014, from Feyenoord. He made his first-team debut for Ajax in March 2020, and won two Eredivisie titles and one KNVB Cup. He won the Marco van Basten Award in 2022. Timber signed for Arsenal in July 2023, for an initial transfer fee of £34 million. Timber made 29 appearances for the Netherlands at youth international level. He was a member of the under-17 team that won the 2018 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. He made his senior international debut in June 2021. Timber started playing for Utrecht-based club DVSU at the age of four, before joining Feyenoord's youth system when he was six. In 2014, he joined Ajax, where he signed his first professional contract in 2018. Timber made his senior debut for Ajax in a 3–1 win over SC Heerenveen on 7 March 2020.[citation needed] He scored his first career goal for Ajax against Emmen on 2 May 2021. It was the opening goal in an eventual 4–0 win. That result confirmed Ajax as Eredivisie champions for a record 35th time. On 14 July 2023, it was announced that Timber had joined Arsenal from Ajax on a long-term contract and would wear the number 12, previously worn by William Saliba. Arsenal paid Ajax an initial transfer fee of £34 million, with the deal containing add-ons that could raise the fee to £38.5 million. On 6 August, he made his competitive debut for the club against Manchester City in the Community Shield, which Arsenal won 4–1 on penalties. Timber made his Premier League debut in a 2–1 home win over Nottingham Forest on August 12. He limped off in the 50th minute with an injury. It was later confirmed that he had suffered an ACL injury on his right knee which would require surgery and keep him out of the game for a "period of time". In February 2024, he was included in the club's squad for the Champions League knockout phase. Timber played youth international football for the Netherlands at under-15, under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels. He was selected for the senior Netherlands squad for UEFA Euro 2020. He made his debut for the team on 2 June 2021, as a starter in a friendly against Scotland. Timber was included in the final selection of the Netherlands team for the 2022 FIFA World Cup by manager Louis van Gaal in November 2022. After missing the opening group stage win against Senegal, he played 90 minutes in the 1–1 draw against Ecuador and the 2–0 win against Qatar. He again played 90 minutes in the round of 16 win against the United States as well as the entirety of the quarter-final match against Argentina, which the Netherlands eventually lost on penalties and so were subsequently eliminated from the tournament. Born in the Netherlands, Timber and his twin brother Quinten Timber, who is also a footballer, are of Aruban and Curaçaoan descent. Their mother Marilyn is from Aruba and their father is from Curaçao, both part of the ABC Islands in the Dutch Caribbean. Due to past situations, the family took on their maternal name Timber instead of taking the last name of their father Maduro. The twins also have three older brothers Shamier, Chris, and Dylan. Timber is a Christian, and often conveys Bible verses through his social media accounts.
