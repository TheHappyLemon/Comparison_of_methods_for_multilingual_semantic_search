Movement For! (Latvian: Kustība Par!) is a liberal political party in Latvia. It is positioned in the centre on the political spectrum. The party was formed in August 2017. From 2018 to 2022 it was one of the members of the Development/For! alliance, before it de facto dissolved. Movement For! did not participate in Latvian parliamentary election in 2014, but received representation in the Saeima when Lolita Čigāne, Ints Dālderis, Andrejs Judins and Aleksejs Loskutovs defected from Unity in July 2017, with Čigāne suggesting the Latvian political spectrum needed a centrist, pro-European party. In February 2018, Saeima members Judins and Loskutovs left the "Movement For". Dālderis and Čigāne retired from the party in April 2018, depriving it of its remaining members of parliament. In June 2018, member of European Parliament Artis Pabriks (former foreign minister and minister of defense of Latvia) defected from Unity to the Movement For, thereby representing the new party in the European Parliament. He continues to sit with the centre-right European People's Party group. Pabriks has also announced to run for the 2018 parliamentary election on the joint list of Latvian Development and Movement For. He was the prime ministerial candidate of Development/For! in the 2018 parliamentary election. In March 2018, Movement For! formed the Development/For! electoral alliance with two small liberal and pro-European parties, Latvian Development (Latvijas attīstībai) and Growth (Izaugsme), to run in the Latvian parliamentary election in October of the same year together. The alliance was fully registered on 20 April 2018. The alliance came in 4th in the election and joined the Kariņš cabinet. The party was accepted as a full member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in October 2019. In November 2020 "Movement For!" announced that in the 2021 Latvian municipal elections, will start with own lists, its identity and program, but there is possibility that in some of the municipalities "Movement For!" will start with a joint list with the parties Latvian Development and Growth.[citation needed] Currently, "Movement For!" has 13 territorial divisions - Ādaži, Cēsis, Jelgava, Jūrmala, Kuldīga, Liepāja, Mārupe, Ogre, Ropaži, Rīga, Tukums, Valmiera and United Kingdom.[citation needed] The party's manifesto emphasizes the need for a unity of society, accessible public health care for everyone, rule of law standing over power and fair trial standing over corruption. The manifesto also calls for a reorganization of the powers to counties and cities, state aid for globally sustainable businesses, and addressing the issue of non-citizens in Latvia. Regarding public safety and foreign policy Movement For! seeks for a close cooperation between Latvia and European Union as well as NATO. The party's leader from its founding to 2022 was Daniels Pavļuts, who was simultaneously Minister of Health and former Minister of Economics in the Third Dombrovskis cabinet.
