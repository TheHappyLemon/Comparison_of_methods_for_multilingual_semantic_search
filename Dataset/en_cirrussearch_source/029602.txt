Simon Špilak (born 23 June 1986) is a retired Slovenian professional road bicycle racer. Born in Tišina, Špilak was the winner of the 2010 Tour de Romandie, after original race winner Alejandro Valverde had his results expunged as part of a doping suspension. Špilak went on to gain second place in that race in 2013 and 2014, both times behind Chris Froome. In 2013, he was the victor of the GP Miguel Induráin and the Eschborn–Frankfurt City Loop, his only two victories of the year. In 2015, he won the general classification of the Tour de Suisse with only five seconds of an advantage over Geraint Thomas. The victory was decided on the last day's time trial. Špilak was considered a rarity in road cycling in that he is a general classification rider who targets one-week races rather than the three-week Grand Tours. In an interview he said that he disliked the heat, so he was always preparing for spring races instead of Grand Tours which took part mostly in summer. In October 2019, Špilak announced his retirement after his Team Katusha–Alpecin team folded. 2003 10th Time trial, UCI Junior Road World Championships 2004 National Junior Road Championships 1st Road race 1st Time trial 1st Overall GP Général Patton 3rd Road race, UCI Junior Road World Championships 4th Paris–Roubaix Juniors 2005 1st Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships 7th GP Kranj 9th Road race, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 2006 1st Poreč Trophy 2nd Time trial, National Under-23 Road Championships 5th Trofeo Zsšdi 7th Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 7th Overall Istrian Spring Trophy 2007 1st La Côte Picarde 4th Overall Tour of Slovenia 1st Young rider classification 4th Overall Tour de l'Avenir 5th Overall Istrian Spring Trophy 2008 5th Overall Tour of Slovenia 5th Overall Three Days of De Panne 9th Tour of Flanders 2009 1st Stage 3 Tour of Slovenia 6th Overall Giro della Provincia di Grosseto 2010 1st Overall Tour de Romandie 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 4 3rd Overall Bayern–Rundfahrt 2011 5th Overall Tour of Slovenia 5th Giro del Friuli 2012 4th Overall Paris–Nice 8th Overall Tour de Romandie 8th Overall Tour of Belgium 10th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 2013 1st GP Miguel Induráin 1st Eschborn–Frankfurt City Loop 2nd Overall Tour de Romandie 1st Stage 4 4th Overall Vuelta a Andalucía 4th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 6th Overall Paris–Nice 9th Overall Tour de Suisse 10th Overall Tour du Poitou-Charentes 2014 1st Stage 5 Critérium du Dauphiné 1st Stage 3 Arctic Race of Norway 2nd Overall Tour de Romandie 1st Stage 3 4th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 8th Overall Paris–Nice 9th Overall Volta ao Algarve 2015 1st Overall Tour de Suisse 2nd Overall Tour de Romandie 3rd Overall Paris–Nice 2016 7th Overall Tour de Romandie 8th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 9th Overall Tour de Suisse 2017 1st Overall Tour de Suisse 1st Stage 7 2nd Pro Ötztaler 5500 10th Overall Tour of the Basque Country 2018 6th Overall Tour de Suisse 9th GP Miguel Induráin 2019 5th Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 6th Overall Tour de Suisse 6th Overall Tour of California 9th Overall Tour de Romandie 10th Overall Volta ao Algarve Retroactively awarded after Alejandro Valverde's results were disqualified following his backdated two-year ban in June 2010.
