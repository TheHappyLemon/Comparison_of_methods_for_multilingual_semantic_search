Olga Sergeyevna Zabelinskaya (also transliterated Zabelinskaia; Ольга Серге́евна Забелинская; born 10 May 1980) is a Russian-born Uzbekistani professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's Continental Team Roland Cycling. While competing for Russia, she won three Olympic medals, before changing allegiances to Uzbekistan in 2018. Born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), Zabelinskaya twice became the junior world champion in 1997, in road and track individual races. She missed the 2004 Olympics because she was having a baby. In 2006, Zabelinskaya quit competitive cycling, but returned in 2009. She qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, where she won bronze medals in both the road race and the time trial. Subsequently, she won a silver medal in the time trial at the 2016 Olympics. She is the first Russian female cyclist to win two Olympic medals in road events. In July 2014 it was reported that Zabelinskaya had tested positive for octopamine at an international race in the spring. In February 2016, she accepted an 18-month ban, which she already served and which expired in September 2015. Zabelinskaya is the daughter of the Olympic champion former cyclist Sergei Sukhoruchenkov. She was separated from her father and they first met when Zabelinskaya was 16. She has three children. As of August 2012[update], she spends winters in Cyprus, where she trains, and summers in Saint Petersburg. 1997 1st Time trial, UCI Junior Road World Championships 1st Points race, UCI Junior Track World Championships 1998 UCI Junior Road World Championships 2nd Road race 2nd Time trial 2nd Points race, UCI Junior Track World Championships 2001 3rd Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 3rd Chrono Champenois-Trophée Européen 7th Trofeo Alfredo Binda-Comune di Cittiglio 7th Overall Tour de l'Aude Cycliste Féminin 9th Overall Giro d'Italia Femminile 2002 1st Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 2003 3rd Overall Holland Ladies Tour 4th Overall Novilon Internationale Damesronde van Drenthe 5th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 9th Overall Grande Boucle Féminine Internationale 1st Stage 1 & 9 2006 1st Stage 7b Tour de l'Aude Cycliste Féminin 2010 1st Overall International Thüringen Rundfahrt der Frauen National Road Championships 2nd Time trial 5th Road race 3rd Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen 3rd Overall Route de France Féminine 4th Memorial Davide Fardelli 9th Overall Giro d'Italia Femminile 9th GP de Plouay 10th Trofeo Alfredo Binda 2011 National Road Championships 2nd Time trial 10th Road race 3rd Chrono des Nations 4th Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen 5th Memorial Davide Fardelli 6th Open de Suède Vårgårda TTT 8th Trofeo Costa Etrusca 9th Overall Energiewacht Tour 9th Overall Iurreta-Emakumeen Bira 10th Trofeo Vannucci Alberto 2012 National Road Championships 1st Time trial 8th Road race 2nd Overall Giro del Trentino Alto Adige-Südtirol 2nd Celtic Chrono Olympic Games 3rd Road Race 3rd Time Trial 3rd Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen 5th Team time trial, UCI Road World Championships 8th National Road Race Championships 9th Overall Tour de Free State 2013 UCI Road World Championships 4th Team time trial 7th Time trial 4th Chrono des Nations 5th Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen 2014 1st Overall Vuelta Femenina a Costa Rica 1st Stage 2 (ITT) 2016 2nd Time Trial, Olympic Games 2nd Overall Tour of Zhoushan Island 2nd Ljubljana–Domžale–Ljubljana 2nd Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen 3rd Time trial, UEC European Road Championships 4th Overall Gracia–Orlová UCI Road World Championships 4th Team time trial 4th Time trial 5th Time trial, National Road Championships 7th Overall Internationale Thüringen Rundfahrt der Frauen 1st Stage 2 7th Crescent Vårgårda TTT 2017 1st Points race, National Track Championships UEC European Road Championships 3rd Road race 8th Time trial 4th Chrono des Nations 6th Overall Internationale Thüringen Rundfahrt der Frauen 8th Team time trial, UCI Road World Championships 8th Liège–Bastogne–Liège Femmes 2018 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Overall The Princess Maha Chackri Sirindhorn's Cup "Women's Tour of Thailand" 1st Stage 1a (TTT) 1st Overall Tour of Eftalia Hotels & Velo Alanya 1st Prologue & Stage 1 1st Ljubljana–Domžale–Ljubljana TT 1st Chrono des Nations 2nd Overall Gracia–Orlová 1st Stage 3 (ITT) 2nd Chrono Champenois-Trophée Européen 3rd Omnium, Six Days of Bremen 7th Overall Emakumeen Euskal Bira 10th Durango-Durango Emakumeen Saria 2019 Asian Track Championships 1st Points race 2nd Individual pursuit 3rd Madison 3rd Omnium Asian Road Championships 1st Road race 1st Time trial National Road Championships 1st Road Race 1st Time Trial 1st Aphrodite Sanctuary Cycling Race 1st Aphrodite Cycling Race Individual Time Trial 2nd Chrono Kristin Armstrong 2nd Ljubljana-Domžale-Ljubljana 4th Grand Prix Justiniano Hotels 4th Grand Prix Alanya 4th Grand Prix Gazipasa 7th Chrono Champenois-Trophée Européen 10th Grand Prix Velo Alanya 2021 1st Grand Prix Kayseri 1st Germenica Grand Prix Road Race 2nd Grand Prix Gündoğmuş 8th Kahramanmaraş Grand Prix Road Race 9th Road race, Olympic Games 10th Grand Prix Velo Alanya 2022 Islamic Solidarity Games 1st Road race 1st Time trial 2023 1st The Tour Oqtosh - Chorvoq - Mountain Ladies Asian Road Championships 1st Time trial 2nd Mixed relay 7th Road race 2nd Tour of Bostonliq I Ladies 2nd Tour of Bostonliq II Ladies 2nd Aphrodite Cycling Race Individual Time Trial 4th Aphrodite Cycling Race - Women for future 4th The Tour Oqtosh - Chorvoq - Mountain Ladies II 5th Umag Trophy LADIES 8th Poreč Trophy LADIES 8th Aphrodite Cycling Race - RR "Забелинская Ольга".
