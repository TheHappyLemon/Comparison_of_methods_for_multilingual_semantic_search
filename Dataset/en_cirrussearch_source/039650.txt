It lies in the northwestern tip of the Iron Mountains, which passes into the lowlands of the Central Elbe Table and East Elbe Table. The town lies on the river Elbe. The first written mention of Týnec nad Labem is from 1110, when there was a meeting of dukes of the Přemyslid dynasty, described in the Chronica Boemorum. After it changed owners several times, it was acquired by the Cistercian Sedlec Abbey. The monks founded here a monastery, inn and mill. After the Hussite Wars in 1463, Týnec was acquired by Vaněk of Miletínek, who had a fortress built here. The next significant owner was Vilém II of Pernštejn. During his rule, Týnec was first referred to as a market town. In 1560, it was bought by Maximilian II. In 1600, Týnec was promoted to a royal chamber town by Emperor Rudolf II. The town was valued as an important crossing point across the Elbe. At the end of the 18th century and in the 19th century, the town became an economic and cultural centre. There were mills, a wool spinning factory, and the only patent leather factory in Austria-Hungary. In 1864, an engineering factory was established. Týnec nad Labem was also the centre of the pearl industry. The Church of the Beheading of Saint John the Baptist is the main Catholic church in the town. It was founded around 1306.
