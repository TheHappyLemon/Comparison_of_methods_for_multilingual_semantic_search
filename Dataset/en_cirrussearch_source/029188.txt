He took part in Idol 2005, eventually finishing fifth, won the first season of Let's Dance, and scored a hit with his 2007 song "Cara Mia", which was his entry in that year's Melodifestivalen. Zelmerlöw was the host of Allsång på Skansen from 2011 to 2013. He participated in Melodifestivalen in 2007, 2009 and won in 2015. Zelmerlöw represented Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 with the song "Heroes", winning the contest with 365 points. Zelmerlöw and Petra Mede co-hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 held in Stockholm. Born in Lund, Måns Zelmerlöw is the son of Birgitta Sahlén, a professor at Lund University, and surgeon Sven-Olof Zelmerlöw. Zelmerlöw studied music in high school in Lund and was part of a school choir project. In 2002, he played one of the brothers in the musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat at Slagthuset in Malmö. Zelmerlöw first entered the public eye in 2005, when he took part in season 2 of the Swedish version of Idol, which was broadcast on TV4. He came in fifth place overall, and was eliminated on 11 November after eight weeks on the show. He had placed in the bottom three once and the bottom two twice. Zelmerlöw took part in the first season of Let's Dance in 2006, partnering with Maria Karlsson. They won the competition, defeating singer Anna Book in the final. In the same year, he also appeared in the Swedish version of the musical Grease, playing the lead role of Danny Zuko. As a result, Zelmerlöw signed a record deal to release a solo album with M&L Records, a division of Warner Music Sweden. In November 2006, it was announced that Zelmerlöw would compete in Melodifestivalen 2007, Sweden's national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, to be held in Helsinki, Finland. He competed with the song "Cara Mia" in the third semi-final on 17 February 2007 in Örnsköldsvik, and progressed to the final, which was held on 10 March at Globen in Stockholm. There his performance of "Cara Mia" finished in third place behind winners The Ark and runner-up Andreas Johnson. "Cara Mia" was released as a single and Zelmerlöw's debut album Stand by For... followed shortly after. The album reached number one in Sweden and was certified platinum by IFPI. Four singles were released from the album, all of which reached the top 50 in Sweden. Stand by For... was also released in Poland in September 2007.

"Hope & Glory" ultimately placed fourth, despite receiving the most votes from the jury. In 2008, Zelmerlöw went back to the studio to work on his second solo album, MZW, which was released in late March 2009. It was certified gold by the IFPI and reached number one on the Swedish album charts. The album was also released in Poland. In 2009 he played a summer tour of Sweden performing songs from both albums. On 10 November 2009, it was announced that Zelmerlöw would host Melodifestivalen 2010, alongside Dolph Lundgren and Christine Meltzer. He hosted the first semi-final and the final with Lundgren and Meltzer, and the remaining semi-finals with only Meltzer. In the opening of the Second Chance round, he performed the Duran Duran song "A View to a Kill", and in the final he sang the Survivor song "Eye of the Tiger" with his fellow presenters.

In the end of January 2016, Zelmerlöw travelled to Australia and sang at Guy Sebastian's 28 date Concert Tour "You..Me..Us Tour" as a surprise guest artist. Zelmerlöw and his band performed at two dates to the delight of Australian audiences who attended Jupiters Hotel and Casino, Gold Coast and regional Grafton to see the Guy Sebastian show. In May 2016, he co-hosted Eurovision Song Contest 2016 in Stockholm with Swedish TV presenter Petra Mede.

In October 2016, he was featured in the TV series Chevaleresk with host Alexander Wiberg. It was broadcast on TV6 . Zelmerlöw's seventh studio album, Chameleon, was released in December 2016.

On November 5, 2016, the French version of "Hanging on to Nothing" was released titled "Rien que nous deux" ("Only the two of us" in English).[citation needed] In 2017, Zelmerlöw was the co-commentator for SVT at the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 alongside Edward af Sillén, Zelmerlöw also appeared in a sketch involving the three hosts; Oleksandr Skichko, Volodymyr Ostapchuk, and Timur Miroshnychenko. On 16 November 2017, it was announced that Zelmerlöw would co-host BBC's Eurovision: You Decide with Mel Giedroyc on 7 February 2018 at the Brighton Dome. He opened the show with a medley of ABBA hits, duetting with UK Eurovision entrant Lucie Jones. In 2018 his song "Happyland", released on the Chameleon album, was chosen by confectionery company Kinder to celebrate its 50th anniversary through commercials broadcast in European countries such as Germany and Italy. On 1 March 2019 Zelmerlöw and Swedish singer Dotter released the song Walk With Me. Zelmerlöw announced in May 2019 that he would release the songs Better Now and Grow Up to Be You. As part of the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 interval act, he covered his favourite entry of 2018, "Fuego", by Eleni Foureira, whilst the Greek singer covered "Dancing Lasha Tumbai" and Conchita covered his song "Heroes", before the acts convened for a version of "Hallelujah". Måns released his version of "Fuego" on iTunes, where the mention of the word "pelican" is removed due to the possible reference to the female anatomy. On 18 October 2019 Zelmerlöw released his eighth studio album, Time. As a third single, the song One has been released on 21 November 2019 for digital download. Zelmerlöw was part of the jury of Eurovision: Australia Decides 2020 and also performed the single Walk With Me, which has been re-released with Australian singer Dami Im on 6 February 2020.

In the winter of 2020, Zelmerlöw and Per Andersson did a Christmas show together called Tomen och Bocken - En slags julshow at Hamburger Börs directed by Edward af Sillén who he had previous worked with on Melodifestivalen and Eurovision, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic only a few days of the show was able to be done before it had to be cancelled. In 2021, he teamed up with fellow Eurovision 2015 contestant Polina Gagarina to record the official song for the World Figure Skating Championships 2021. Released on 21 February 2021, the single was called Circles and Squares. Since 2021, he has been participating in Masked Singer Sverige. In 2023, as part of the lead-up for the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 set to be held in Liverpool, he was a co-presenter of the weekly BBC Sounds podcast Eurovisioncast on BBC Radio 5. Zelmerlöw has one younger sister, Fanny (b. 1989). He most enjoys padel, football, tennis and golf. On 26 December 2004, Zelmerlöw and his family survived the Indian Ocean earthquake while on holiday in Khao Lak, Thailand. In March 2014, while a guest on Swedish cooking show Pluras kök, Zelmerlöw commented that he considered homosexuality an avvikelse (English: deviation). On the show, he said he did not think there was anything wrong with homosexuality, but that it is not natural biologically, since it does not lead to reproduction. He later apologised repeatedly for his remarks, claiming that they were a miscommunication. After his Melodifestivalen win a year later, the incident came under international media scrutiny, prompting a few members of gay, Swedish and Eurovision media to come to Zelmerlöw's defence. He later said that he would date a man "if [he] got that feeling". Between 2008 and 2011, he was in a relationship with the Swedish singer and model Marie Serneholt, a former member of the Swedish pop band A-Teens. In 2016, Zelmerlöw began dating British actress Ciara Janson and they later announced their engagement. In December 2017, Zelmerlöw announced that they were expecting a child together. A few weeks later, he confirmed that the child would be a boy. The couple live in Surrey, just outside London. On 25 May 2018 he announced via social media that Ciara had given birth to their son, Albert. The couple married on 5 September 2019. On 9 August 2022, Zelmerlöw announced on Instagram that Ciara had given birth to their second son, Ossian Matteus Zelmerlöw. Stand by For...
