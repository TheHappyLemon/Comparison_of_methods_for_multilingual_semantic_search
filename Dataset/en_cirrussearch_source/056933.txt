FC Energie Cottbus (Lower Sorbian: Energija Chóśebuz) is a German football club based in Cottbus, Brandenburg. It was founded in 1963 as SC Cottbus in what was East Germany. After the reunification of Germany, Energie played six seasons in the third tier of the German football league system before floating between the 2. Bundesliga and Bundesliga for 17 years between 1997 and 2014. From 2014 to 2016, the club played in the third tier, 3. Liga, and were then relegated to the Regionalliga Nordost. In 2018, they were promoted back into the 3. Liga, only to be relegated again the next season. Energie Cottbus can trace its roots back to a predecessor side of FSV Glückauf Brieske-Senftenberg, a club founded by coal miners in 1919, in what was then called the town of Marga.[citation needed] FV Grube Marga, as the club was then called, was active until 1924 when the miners left to form a new team called SV Sturm Grube Marga, which was banned by the Nazi Party in 1933. The club re-emerged after World War II in 1949 as BSG Franz Mehring Grube, becoming BSG Aktivist Brieske-Ost in 1950.[citation needed] The club was re-organized as sports club SC Aktivist Brieske-Senftenberg in 1954 and played in the DDR-Oberliga generally earning mid-table results until relegation to second-tier DDR-Liga in the early 1960s.[vague][citation needed] The players of this side joined the new sports club SC Energie Cottbus in 1963, whilst the reserve team merged back to BSG Aktivist Brieske-Ost to form BSG Aktivist Senftenberg.[citation needed] The club still exists as FSV Glückauf Brieske-Senftenberg today.[citation needed] SC Cottbus was quickly assisted by a wholesale transfer of players from SC Aktivist Brieske-Ost ordered by the East German authorities,[citation needed] who often intervened in the business of the country's sports and football clubs for political reasons. East German authorities had a penchant for[according to whom?] tagging sports teams with the names of socialist heroes: Franz Mehring was a German socialist politician and journalist. In the mid-1960s, a re-organization program by the regime led to the separation of football sides from sports clubs and the creation of BSG von Bodo Krautz under the patronage of a local coal mine.[citation needed] The football club went by that name only briefly and was quickly renamed BSG Energie in early 1966. The team took on the name FC Energie in 1990 at the time of German reunification. After years as a II division or lower-table I division side in East Germany, Energie emerged as one of the few former DDR sides to enjoy[tone] relative prosperity in a united Germany. After six seasons playing tier III football, the club earned returned to the 2. Bundesliga in 1997 (the same year they became the first former East German club to play the DFB Cup Final), winning the Regionalliga Nordost, and then played its way into the Bundesliga in 2000, where it had a three-year stay.[vague][citation needed] A key player in the Bundesliga run was Vasile Miriuță, an imaginative[according to whom?] midfield player.[citation needed] After being returned, Energie narrowly missed a prompt[tone] return to the top tier, losing out to Mainz 05 on goal difference. In 2004–05, Energie struggled with both financial (reported debts of €4.5 million) and on-field problems, and the only club escaped relegation to the third tier Regionalliga by scoring one more goal than Eintracht Trier while having the same number of points and goal difference.[vague][citation needed] During the season, the manager and the chairman were replaced.[by whom?] The 2005–06 season was a much more successful one,[according to whom?] as the club finished third and returned to the Bundesliga. The 2006–07 Bundesliga season resulted in a 13th-place finish and 41 points, a club record total in the Bundesliga.[citation needed] Energie Cottbus were the only club from the former East Germany playing in the Bundesliga until they lost a relegation play-off to 1. FC Nürnberg in 2009.[citation needed] Cottbus remained in the 2. Bundesliga for another five seasons until 2014, when an 18th-place finish meant returning to the 3. Liga, ending a 17-season stint in the top two divisions.[citation needed] After a 19th-place finish in the 3. Liga in 2015–16, the club suffered[tone] another returned to the Regionalliga Nordost.[vague] Following two seasons in the fourth tier, Cottbus returned to 3. Liga after defeating Weiche Flensburg over two legs in the Regionalliga play-offs, but in the 2018–19 season they were returned to the Regionalliga after finishing 17th. On May 21, 2023, Cottbus won the Regionalliga Nordost with their win over SV Babelsberg 03 in Matchweek 33.[vague] It was their third time winning Regionalliga Nordost and their first since 2018. 13 days later, on June 3, 2023, Cottbus won the Brandenburg Cup for the 11th time in their history.[citation needed] They defeated FSV 63 Luckenwalde by a score of 4–1.
