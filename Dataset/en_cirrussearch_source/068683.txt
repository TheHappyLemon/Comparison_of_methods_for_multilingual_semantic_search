SpaceX Crew-7 was the seventh crewed operational NASA Commercial Crew flight and the eleventh overall crewed orbital flight of a Crew Dragon spacecraft. The mission launched on 26 August 2023. The Crew-7 mission transported four crew members to the International Space Station (ISS), consisting of one NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli, one ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen of Denmark, one JAXA astronaut Satoshi Furukawa, and one Roscosmos cosmonaut Konstantin Borisov. Mogensen was the first non-American to serve as a pilot of Crew Dragon. The seventh SpaceX operational mission in the Commercial Crew Program launched on 26 August 2023. The European segment of the mission is called Huginn, named after the raven from Norse mythology of the same name. One week after the arrival of Crew-8, Crew-7 undocked from the ISS, returning to Earth by splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico near Florida on March 12, 2024.
