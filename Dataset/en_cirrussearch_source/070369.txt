Bangued, officially the Municipality of Bangued (Ilocano: Ili ti Bangued; Tagalog: Bayan ng Bangued), is a 1st class municipality and capital of the province of Abra, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 50,382 people. The name Bangued evolved from the Ilocano word "Bangan," which means roadblock or blockade. The Tinguians prevented the Spanish forces from penetrating their area and they placed roadblocks on all roads leading to the place. They also cut large logs and threw them to the Abra River to prevent the incoming Spanish colonist and Ilocano settlers from entering the area with the use of their boats and bamboo rafts. When the logs reached Nagtalabungan the strength of the currents allowed many of these trees to be left behind for the strong current gets narrower as it bends westwards on its course to the South China Sea across a gap in the Ilocos range, better known as "Banaoang." These logs were also made as obstacles and big rocks were placed along the roads which the natives called "bangan". The early settlers were the Tinguians belonging to the Bago, Masadiit, lbanao, and Indayas tribes who later intermarried with the immigrants from Ilocos. The Tingguians opposed the Christianization introduced by the Spanish friars who penetrated the eastern settlements. In 1598, Augustinian fathers Martin and Minon were able to penetrate the valley and found a "mission" in Bangued. A Spanish military garrison was also established to protect the inhabitants from the attacks of the headhunters. In November 1601, Fray Esteban Marín in the company of an expedition under Captain Mateo de Aranda arrived in Abra but was killed, with his body tied up to a tree, shot by arrows, before being dismembered. In 1614, Fr. Juan de Pareja, "Conquistador Espiritual" of Abra, arrived with the protection of the Spanish garrison and advanced further to the interior. In 1615, Fr. Juan Pareja organized Bangued as a mission center and baptized 3,000 Tingguians with the help of their chief, Manuel Dumawal. On April 5, 1617, Bangued was created into a ministry by the Augustinians and Fr. Pedro Columbo was the first minister. Bangued was made an independent mission territory in 1692. The construction of the big church in Bangued began in 1722 and was completed in 1807. It was about 73 meters long. A spacious convento was built adjoining it. It later became the Sacred Heart of Jesus Academy, which is now the Holy Spirit Academy, a convent for sisters and a school for girls and boys. At July 25, 1861, the Feast of St. James the Great (Apo Senor Santiago), the town was formally inaugurated. In August 1898, Fr. Inocencio Vega was the last Spanish missionary to work in Bangued. When the Americans colonized the country and established the civil government. On March 10, 1945, at 3:00 P.M., some American planes guided by Filipinos dropped incendiary bombs on the capitol, the catholic church and adjoining buildings. On subsequent days the whole town was bombed. Whoever the bombers saw, they machine-gunned and the whole town as in flames and ruins. Many were burned and whoever could escape fled to the barrios. Cityhood for Bangued is being given a push in the 16th Congress. Abra Representative Ma. Jocelyn Bernos filed a resolution seeking a congressional nod for the capital town's cityhood. In the 19th Congress of the Philippines, house bills were filed by various representatives which sought Bangued including other capital towns of provinces with no current component cities, independent component cities or highly urbanized cities to automatically convert into cities.
