Hampus Lindholm (Swedish pronunciation: [hamːpɵs lɪnːdhɔlm];[tone?] born 20 January 1994) is a Swedish professional ice hockey defenceman for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). Lindholm began his ice hockey career with Jonstorps IF and previously played with Rögle BK. He then played with the Anaheim Ducks for his first eight seasons in the NHL, before being dealt to Boston. In 2009–10, Lindholm played for the Jonstorps U20 team, scoring three points (one goal and two assists) in three games. The following year, he played 39 games for Rögle BK U20, providing four assists. In 2011–12, Lindholm began his professional career with Rögle, playing 20 games and scoring four points, Lindholm was also named the U20 Super Elit League's Best Defenseman. Lindholm was a top prospect who was ranked fourth among European skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau, and he was selected sixth overall in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft by the Anaheim Ducks. He was considered by some to be a sleeper pick for the draft, with Rob Brodie comparing Lindholm to Erik Karlsson and Mika Zibanejad, two other Swedish prospects who rose sharply in the Draft. Lindholm made his North American debut with the Norfolk Admirals, the Ducks' former American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, in 2012–13. That year, he played 44 games, getting 11 points (one goal and ten assists). Lindholm scored his first NHL goal on 6 November 2013, against Mike Smith of the Phoenix Coyotes. After proving himself as one of Anaheim's top defensemen, Lindholm signed a six-year $31.5M contract on 27 October 2016. In the final year of his contract and set to become an unrestricted free agent, trade rumors on Lindholm were increasing. On 19 March 2022, he was traded to the Boston Bruins for a 2022 first round pick, a 2023 second round pick, a 2024 second round pick, Urho Vaakanainen and John Moore. On 20 March 2022, just after being acquired by Boston, Lindholm was signed to an eight-year, $52M contract extension. In the early season absence of Charlie McAvoy during the 2022–23 season, Lindholm proved himself to be very valuable to the Bruins. Lindholm and the Bruins went on to have a record-breaking season in 2022–23, winning the most regular season games ever by a team, with 65, before falling to the Florida Panthers in seven games in the first round of the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs. After being eliminated, it was revealed that Lindholm had played with a fractured foot in the playoffs. Lindholm's successful season ended with him finishing fourth in Norris Trophy voting for best defenseman, as well as being named to the NHL Second All-Star team. Lindholm has represented Sweden at the 2012 U18 World Junior Championship, winning the silver medal. In the 2012 J18 World Championships, he was voted one of the Swedish team's three most valuable players of the tournament. He also won the most valuable player award in the games against Finland and Switzerland. Lindholm was not able to play for Sweden at the 2013 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships due to a concussion. Lindholm is a two-way defenceman who is good at passing the puck. His skating and hockey intelligence have also been admired. Former NHL and Rögle BK defenseman Kenny Jönsson has influenced Lindholm, and Lindholm mentioned Nicklas Lidström and Scott Niedermayer as his other role models.
