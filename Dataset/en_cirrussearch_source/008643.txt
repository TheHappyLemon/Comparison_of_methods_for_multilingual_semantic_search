Ramūnas Navardauskas (born 30 January 1988) is a Lithuanian former professional road racing cyclist, who rode professionally between 2011 and 2022 for Cannondale–Drapac, Bahrain–Merida, Nippo–Delko–One Provence and the Voltas Cycling Team. Following his retirement as a rider, Navardauskas now works as a directeur sportif for UCI Continental team EF Education–Nippo Development Team. After four years in the amateur ranks, Navardauskas turned professional with Garmin–Cervélo in 2011. During the 2012 Giro d'Italia, Navardauskas finished sixth in the opening individual time trial; twenty-two seconds shy of American Taylor Phinney (BMC Racing Team). In stage four's team time trial, Garmin–Barracuda were victorious, and Navardauskas took the race lead. He became the first Lithuanian to wear the pink jersey. However, Navardauskas lost the jersey to Italian Adriano Malori (Lampre–ISD) on stage six. In April 2015, Navardauskas won the Circuit de la Sarthe by a single second over Manuele Boaro, winning the race for the second consecutive year. In September 2017 Navardauskas had a successful heart surgery for a cardiac arrhythmia. Born in Šilalė, Navardauskas previously resided in Oliva, Valencian Community, Spain. In September 2017, he married fellow Lithuanian cyclist Gabrielė Jankutė, and the couple have a son, born in 2020.
