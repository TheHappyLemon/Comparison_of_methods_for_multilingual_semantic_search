Växjö-Kronoberg Airport (IATA: VXO, ICAO: ESMX), branded as Växjö Småland Airport, is an airport in Kronoberg county, Sweden. The airport is located about 10 kilometres (6 mi) northwest of central Växjö. The airport is owned by Kronoberg county and Växjö municipality. A small share is held by Alvesta municipality. Scheduled aviation from Växjö started around 1960 from Uråsa airbase, 20 km (10 miles) south of Växjö. A larger airport was needed, so it was built at its present location in 1975. Traffic went mainly to Stockholm from the start. After 2007, international traffic greatly increased with low price airlines like Ryanair and Wizzair. Charter flights to Southern Europe and the Canary Islands have also increased. In April 2020, the Stockholm route was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but was restarted in August 2021. The alternative route to Stockholm is by train (3½ hours) or a flight from Kalmar, the nearest airport with regular flights to Stockholm.
