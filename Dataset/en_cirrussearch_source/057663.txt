On 23 February 2022, Yaremchuk scored the equaliser in a 2–2 home draw against Ajax, in the first leg of the round of 16 tie of the Champions League. Yaremchuk celebrated his goal by unveiling a shirt with Ukraine's coat of arms on it, as way of supporting his nation amid the previous day's invasion by Russia. Four days later, after coming on as a 62nd-minute substitute for Darwin Núñez, he received the club's captain armband by Jan Vertonghen, before receiving a standing ovation from Benfica's supporters, due to his country's invasion, during a 3–0 home victory against Vitória de Guimarães. On 13 April, he scored Benfica's second goal in a 3–3 draw against Liverpool in the second leg of the quarter-finals tie, while his team lost 6–4 on aggregate.

Yaremchuk married Christina in 2017. Their son was born in 2019. In 2022, following Ukraine's invasion by Russia, Yaremchuck asked fellow Ukraine national teammate Andriy Yarmolenko to help save his wife's parents. Yaremchuck revealed the situation was critical and he didn't even know what to do, so he turned to Andriy Yarmolenko, knowing that he was from Chernihiv, and he helped him and days later his wife's parents were rescued.
