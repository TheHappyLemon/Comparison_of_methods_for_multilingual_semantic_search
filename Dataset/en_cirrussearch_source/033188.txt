Beeskow (Lower Sorbian: Bezkow, pronounced [ˈbɛskɔw]) is a town in Brandenburg, in eastern Germany, and capital of the Oder-Spree district. It is situated on the river Spree, 30 km southwest of Frankfurt an der Oder. In 1518 the town was purchased by the Diocese of Lubusz, and it was the place of death of the last bishop in 1555. The town was a fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia until 1742, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. From 1815 to 1947, it was part of the Province of Brandenburg. One of the main escape routes for insurgents of the unsuccessful Polish November Uprising from partitioned Poland to the Great Emigration led through the town. After World War II, Beeskow was incorporated into the State of Brandenburg from 1947 to 1952 and the Bezirk Frankfurt of East Germany from 1952 to 1990. Since 1990, Beeskow is again part of Brandenburg.
