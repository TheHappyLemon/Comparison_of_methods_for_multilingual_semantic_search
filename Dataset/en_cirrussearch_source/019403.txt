September 20 – Battle of Myton: Scottish forces (some 15,000 men) led by James the Black, Lord Douglas, defeat an English army in an encounter known as the "Chapter of Myton" because of the large number of clergymen involved. David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, writes 460 years later, "The English were instantly routed. Three thousand were left dead on the field, and great part of fugitives drowned in the Swale. In this action there fell three thousand ecclesiastics, [20th September.] According to the savage peasantry of those times, this rout was termed by the Scots, the Chapter of Mitton." After the battle, King Edward II is forced to raise the siege at Berwick Castle and retreats south of the River Trent, allowing the Scots to ravage Cumberland and Westmorland unmolested.
