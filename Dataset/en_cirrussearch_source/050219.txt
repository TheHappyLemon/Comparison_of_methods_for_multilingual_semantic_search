A uvular–epiglottal consonant is a doubly articulated consonant pronounced by making a simultaneous uvular consonant and epiglottal consonant. An example is the Somali "uvular" plosive /q/, which is a voiceless uvular–epiglottal plosive [q͡ʡ], as in [q͡ʡíìq͡ʡ] 'to emit smoke'. Edmondson, Jerold A.; Esling, John H.; Harris, Jimmy G.
