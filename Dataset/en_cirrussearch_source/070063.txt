The Caraballo Mountains is a mountain range in the central part of Luzon island in the Philippines, situated between the Cordillera Central and Sierra Madre mountain ranges. The mountains serve as the location of the river source of the Cagayan River, the longest in the country. Several portions of the mountain range are protected under the National Integrated Protected Areas System, including the Casecnan Protected Landscape and the Pantabangan–Carranglan Watershed Forest Reserve. The Caraballo Mountains can be reached by the Pangasinan-Nueva Ecija Road, taking one and a half hours to travel from the Downtown of San Nicolas. The Caraballo Mountains gained tourists because of the attractions and waterfalls that the Mountain Range offers. The mountains have 100-500 people going to the range each day. Residents have their own backyard gardens, where they plant vegetables which they sell in a nearby Public Market.
