SpaceX CRS-18, also known as SpX-18, was SpaceX's 18th flight to the International Space Station under the Commercial Resupply Services program for NASA. It was launched on 25 July 2019 aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. The same Dragon capsule has previously flown to the ISS in April 2015 and December 2017. This was the first time a capsule was used for a third flight. In February 2016, it was announced that NASA had awarded a contract extension to SpaceX for five CRS additional missions (CRS-16 to CRS-20). NASA has contracted for the CRS-18 mission from SpaceX and therefore determines the primary payload, date/time of launch, and orbital parameters for the Dragon space capsule. It carried the third International Docking Adapter (IDA-3). The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: Science investigations: 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) Crew supplies: 233 kg (514 lb) Vehicle hardware: 157 kg (346 lb) Spacewalk equipment: 157 kg (346 lb) Computer resources: 17 kg (37 lb) External payloads: IDA-3 534 kg (1,177 lb) The Dragon spacecraft also featured a handful of ceramic heat shield tiles, meant to flight-test a critical component of the SpaceX Starship spacecraft.
