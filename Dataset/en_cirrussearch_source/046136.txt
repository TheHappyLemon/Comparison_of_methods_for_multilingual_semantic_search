Gianni Moscon (born 20 April 1994) is an Italian professional cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Soudal–Quick-Step. He competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics, in the road race. Moscon grew up in the apple farms north of Trento in Trentino in the north of Italy. This led to him being given the nickname "Il Trattore", which translates to "The Tractor". In September 2015, it was announced that he had signed a professional contract with Team Sky for the 2016 season. This followed a recommendation from Fausto Pinarello, of the company who manufacture the team's bicycles, who had seen Moscon winning amateur races and spoke about him to Sky sport director Dario Cioni. Moscon recorded his first professional victory at the Arctic Race of Norway when he won the queen stage. He later went on to win the general classification, as well as the youth classification. He was named in the startlist for the 2017 Vuelta a España. In July 2018, he was named in the start list for the 2018 Tour de France. During the 2017 Tour de Romandie, Moscon racially abused French cyclist Kévin Reza. He was suspended from racing with Team Sky for six weeks. The team indicated that any further behavioural incidents would result in Moscon's contract being terminated. Moscon was also accused of purposefully crashing FDJ rider Sébastien Reichenbach during the 2017 Tre Valli Varesine, though the investigation was dropped on the incident due to a lack of evidence, as the crash was not captured on television cameras. Moscon was disqualified from the 2017 UCI World Championships Road Race after being towed back to the peloton by the Italian team car following a crash on the penultimate lap. Moscon ultimately bridged to a breakaway with French rider Julian Alaphilippe in the final five kilometers of the race before finishing 29th. Following the race, Moscon was disqualified by race commissaires. Moscon was disqualified from the 2018 Tour de France after punching Élie Gesbert of Fortuneo–Samsic during stage 15. Moscon was disqualified from the 2020 Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne after he was caught on camera throwing a bike at another rider after a massive crash in the peloton. Upon finding out he was disqualified, he proceeded to remove his race numbers on camera for which he was fined CHF 500. Rider Jens Debusschere, at whom Moscon had thrown the bike, suffered a cut to his hand and wrist and commented at the finish line: "It’s a series of incidents and it's always the same guy. [...] It’s not only this incident, there’s many more incidents. If you ask around in the peloton about how their relation is with him, then ninety per cent will react negatively." 2012 4th Overall Giro della Lunigiana 2014 1st Piccolo Giro di Lombardia 2nd GP Capodarco 5th Gran Premio di Poggiana 6th Giro del Belvedere 8th Coppa della Pace 9th Gran Premio Palio del Recioto 10th Trofeo Alcide Degasperi 2015 1st Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships 1st Gran Premio San Giuseppe 1st Trofeo Città di San Vendemiano 1st Coppa dei Laghi-Trofeo Almar 2nd Ronde van Vlaanderen U23 4th Road race, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 4th Trofeo Banca Popolare di Vicenza 5th Overall Course de la Paix U23 2016 (2 pro wins) 1st Overall Arctic Race of Norway 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 3 3rd Overall Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali National Road Championships 4th Time trial 5th Road race 5th Overall Tour du Poitou-Charentes 6th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal 7th Overall Tour de Yorkshire 8th Nokere Koerse 2017 (1) National Road Championships 1st Time trial 5th Road race UCI Road World Championships 3rd Team time trial 6th Time trial 3rd Giro di Lombardia 5th Paris–Roubaix 5th Giro dell'Emilia 7th Overall Route du Sud 7th Tre Valli Varesine 2018 (5) 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Overall Tour of Guangxi 1st Young rider classification 1st Stage 4 1st Coppa Ugo Agostoni 1st Giro della Toscana 1st Stage 3 (TTT) Critérium du Dauphiné 2nd Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana 3rd Coppa Sabatini 5th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 8th E3 Harelbeke 8th Trofeo Lloseta–Andratx 2019 4th Road race, UCI Road World Championships 5th Time trial, National Road Championships 6th Overall Tour of Britain 2021 (3) 1st Gran Premio di Lugano Tour of the Alps 1st Stages 1 & 3 4th Road race, National Road Championships 4th Paris–Roubaix 7th Coppa Sabatini 8th Giro della Toscana 9th Clásica de San Sebastián "The rise of Gianni Moscon".
