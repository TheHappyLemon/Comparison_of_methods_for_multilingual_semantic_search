He was drafted in the second round, 46th overall, by the Edmonton Oilers in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. Having been drafted by the Edmonton Oilers in the second round, 46th overall, at the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, on 25 April 2011, the Oilers signed Marinčin to a three-year, entry-level contract. During the 2013–14 season, Marinčin was called up to the Oilers, and on 5 December 2013, he made his NHL debut in a game against the Colorado Avalanche. On 27 June 2015, Marinčin was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Brad Ross and a fourth-round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. On 5 October 2017, Marinčin was placed on waivers by the Maple Leafs. After clearing waivers the next day, he was loaned to the Maple Leafs' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. On 17 December 2017, he was recalled to the Toronto Maple Leafs after Nikita Zaitsev was placed on the injured reserve with a lower-body injury. Marinčin appeared in two games with the Leafs before being sent down to the Marlies on 5 January 2018. On 29 June 2019, Marinčin agreed to a one-year $700,000 contract extension to remain with the Maple Leafs. On 10 January 2020, Marinčin agreed to another one-year $700,000 contract extension to remain with the Maple Leafs. After six seasons within the Maple Leafs organization, Marinčin left as an impending free agent, returning to Europe in signing a one-year contract with the Czech club, HC Oceláři Třinec of the ELH, on 16 June 2021. Marinčin was chosen to play for Slovakia at the 2011 World Junior Championships. During a game against the United States, he was ejected for a hit to the head on forward Jason Zucker.
