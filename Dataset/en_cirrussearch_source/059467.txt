In 1923, while director of the dressage school in Caen, he was appointed an officer of the Order of Agricultural Merit. In June 1900, with his horse Retournelle, Archenoul was runner-up in the hacks and hunter (saddle horses) event during the International Horse Show in Paris. The event was part of the Exposition Universelle, and later classified as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics. Stéphane Gachet JO d'été. Tous les médaillés français de 1896 à nos jours, ed.
