Tijana Bošković (Serbian Cyrillic: Тијана Бошковић; born 8 March 1997) is a Serbian professional volleyball player. She has won gold medals with the Serbia women's national volleyball team at the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, and the 2017 and 2019 European Championships. She is also a two-time Olympic medalist, having won silver at the 2016 Rio Games and bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Games. Bošković is left-handed and has been one of Serbia's key players ever since her debut with the national team in 2014. By the age of 21, she had already played in gold medal matches in all major tournaments (Olympic Games, World Championship, and European Championship), and she was one of the players who contributed a lot of winning points for Serbia. Bošković's record in major championships is nothing short of phenomenal – 10 majors played, reaching the semifinals 9 times and making it to the finals 7 times. So far, she has never missed standing on the podium in every major she has played, except for her debut year at the 2014 World Championship. Being selected for the 2019 European Volleyball Confederation Female Volleyball Player of the Year award, Bošković has recorded an impressive achievement by receiving that award for three consecutive years (2017, 2018, 2019). Bošković became the first woman to spike and serve at a speed exceeding 110 km/h. During the Eczacıbaşı Dynavit–Imoco Volley Conegliano match at the 2022 FIVB Club World Championship, Bošković broke the women's world record for the fastest serve at a lightning speed of 111.4 km/h. Not stopping there, she also smashed her own record for spike speed by hitting the ball at an incredible 110.9 km/h in the same game. This puts her as the second-fastest spiker in women's volleyball history, sharing the spot with Annie Drews, just behind Paola Egonu. Bošković began her national volleyball team career when she was just 15 years old, joining the Serbian junior team. In 2013, she won a silver medal at the 2013 European Youth Olympic Festival, where she was named the Most Valuable Player and Best Spiker. In the final against Slovenia, she scored 29 points all by herself, but unfortunately, it wasn't quite enough to win the gold medal for her team. The next year brought an incredible achievement as Bošković played a pivotal role in Serbia's U19 national team securing victory in the 2014 Women's Junior European Volleyball Championship by defeating Slovenia in an exciting five-setter match. Bošković earned her the well-deserved title of Most Valuable Player, as she topped the scorers with 38 points in the final match. This victory was a historic moment for Serbian volleyball, as it marked their first gold medal in a junior-level competition. At just 16 years old, Bošković received a special call-up to join the senior national team in December 2013 for a two-week training session. A year later, Bošković stepped onto the world stage, making her debut with the Serbia national team at the prestigious 2014 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship. Despite being the youngest player on the team, Bošković left an instant impression by emerging as the top scorer for Serbia in many matches. She showcased her talent by scoring a total of 129 points in eight games, contributing significantly to the team's seventh-place finish. The iconic American player turned coach, Karch Kiraly, was thoroughly impressed by Bošković's performance, expressing that she is "set for big things." Kiraly's words of praise acknowledged Bošković's exceptional talent and hinted at a promising future for her in the world of volleyball. "I'm still trying to understand how she's still only 17 years-old. She's far beyond her years and if she's only 17 she's got an incredibly bright future. She's going to be a big and important player for Serbia for many years to come. She understands the game well, she can take these high swings and she's a handful." Bošković, who joined the team shortly before the start of the tournament, was pleasantly surprised to receive the national team call-up and felt grateful for the opportunity. "I didn't imagine that I would play at the World Championship. I'm very happy just for the fact that I'm here. It's for sure a wonderful experience for me and for my future." Despite being one of the least experienced players, Bošković participated in the tournament after her triumph at the 2014 Women's Junior European Volleyball Championship. Serbia's head coach, Zoran Terzic, revealed that Bošković had only trained with the senior national team for a mere three or four days before the World Championship. He explained that his plan was to include her in this tournament as preparation for the upcoming 2015 European Championship and the 2016 Olympic Games. Bošković achieved her first medal with the senior national team by clinching the silver at the 2015 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup. This competition served as a qualification event for the Olympic Games, and Serbia's second-place finish secured their spot at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Bošković, emerging as Serbia's leading scorer, tallied a total of 159 points. Notably, she ranked among the top three highest scorers in the tournament and was the youngest player to be featured in the top 10 scorers' list. Bošković made her first appearance in the Women's European Volleyball Championship and secured her first medal in a major tournament. The team's victory over Turkey in straight sets earned them the bronze medal at the 2015 Women's European Volleyball Championship. In the following year, Bošković and the team accomplished a remarkable feat by winning a silver medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics. This achievement marked Serbia's first-ever medal in Olympic Games volleyball history. Bošković, alongside Brankica Mihajlović, led the team to the final, delivering outstanding performances in a thrilling five-set match against the world's number one and undefeated team in the tournament, the United States. At the age of 19, Bošković emerged as a sensational talent and a key offensive force for Serbia throughout the tournament. Her outstanding performance placed her among the top three scorers in the competition. She not only led Serbia in scoring but also secured the second spot in serving, following her teammate Milena Rašić. In a historic achievement, Bošković recorded 10 aces and became the first player in Olympic Games history to achieve serve speeds exceeding 100 km/h. After a successful 2016 with Serbia, Bošković continued to shine at the 2017 FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix. Scored a total of 31 points, she led the team to a bronze medal victory, defeating the host team, China in four sets. Bošković received the recognition of being named the Best Opposite Player of the tournament. In the 2017 Women's European Volleyball Championship, Bošković led her team to a flawless victory over the Netherlands, resulting in Serbia clinching their second European title, undefeated. This marked her first major title with the senior national team, and her outstanding performance crowned her the title of the tournament's Most Valuable Player. Bošković accumulated a total of 130 points, averaging an impressive 7.22 points per set, surpassing the scoring record of every other player in the competition. Immediately after winning her first major title, Bošković shared her immense joy and commended her team for their exceptional performance throughout the championship. "We are European champions, this feeling is incredible!  We played really well, like one, as a team from the beginning.  We lost only two sets from the start of the European Championship.  We worked five months for this and you can see the result." Anne Buijs, a player representing the Netherlands, openly acknowledged that her team had been thoroughly prepared to face Serbia. However, they encountered difficulties in containing the formidable duo of Bošković and Mihajlović. Buijs also conceded that Serbia outperformed their team, making them the superior side on that day. During the first edition of the VNL, the 2018 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League, Serbia ranked 5th in the tournament, and Bošković stood out as the best attacker, registering an impressive total of 206 successful killing spikes. Bošković helped Serbia achieve a historic milestone by getting their first-ever title at the 2018 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship, defeating Italy in a thrilling five-sets game. She was honored as the Most Valuable Player of the tournament, and once again, she emerged as the top scorer for Serbia, amassing a total of 193 points. She also established herself as the best spiker in the championship, boasting an impressive success rate of 53.7% in her spike attempts. One of the highlights of the final match was Bošković's incredible attack, where she managed to find a sharp angle over a high triple block with just a bump set from the libero.

Bošković and Serbia continued their winning streak in majors by securing back-to-back European titles at the 2019 Women's European Volleyball Championship. They triumphed over the host team, Turkey, in a nail-biting five-set match, leaving the 10,000-strong home crowd in Ankara in stunned silence. Bošković's exceptional performance did not go unnoticed, as she received dual honors by being named the Most Valuable Player and Best Opposite of the tournament. This remarkable achievement made her just the second player, following Russia's Tatiana Kosheleva, to earn the MVP award two times in a row. At the 2019 FIVB Women's Volleyball Intercontinental Olympic Qualification Tournaments, Bošković contributed a total of 75 points in the three matches played, securing her team's qualification for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Bošković not only ranked among the top three highest scorers in the tournament but also excelled as the best spiker, achieving an impressive success rate of 56.9% in her spike attempts. Tijana Bošković is widely acknowledged as one of the most dominant volleyball players in the world. Her value in the sport was highlighted in 2020 when she got named as part of the International Volleyball Federation's Roster100, an honor designated for the 100 greatest volleyball players between 2010 and 2020.[non-primary source needed] At the 2020 Summer Olympics, Bošković earned the title of Best Opposite in the Tokyo 2020 Dream Team as she carried her team to a bronze medal victory. She achieved a remarkable milestone by becoming the first player to score 30 points or more in three different matches within a single Olympic Games tournament. She accomplished this feat twice in three sets, registering 34 points against Japan and 33 points against Korea, and added 32 points in a four-set defeat against Brazil. Furthermore, Bošković and Jordan Thompson are the only players in Olympic Games history to score 30 or more points in just three sets. She also becomes the third player, following legends Yekaterina Gamova and Kim Yeon-koung, to have three entries in the list of those who have scored 30 points or more in a single Olympic Games match. Bošković emerged as the tournament's top scorer, scoring a total of 192 points across eight matches, averaging a staggering 24 points per match. She showcased exceptional efficiency as an attacker, converting 165 of her 313 swings for an outstanding 52.7% killing rate. Additionally, she was the second-best server with 12 aces. During the matches against Japan and Korea, Bošković single-handedly scored 34 and 33 points, while her teammates contributed a total of 30 and 25 points in total. Just a month after the 2020 Summer Olympics, Bošković earned the Fans' All Star Team Best Opposite with 263,932 votes, as her team won the silver medal at the 2021 Women's European Volleyball Championship. With this achievement, Serbia's women's volleyball national team became the only European team, encompassing both men and women, to claim a medal in both the 2020 Olympic Games and the 2021 European Championship.

At the end of the year, she was chosen for the 4th place in the list of The Best Player (women) of 2021 by volleyballworld. At the 2022 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship, Bošković took on the role of team captain for the first time in her senior national team career, stepping in for Maja Ognjenović. Under her leadership, Serbia successfully defended their second World title. Bošković's remarkable contributions crowned her the titles of Most Valuable Player and Best Opposite of the tournament. She became the second player in history to achieve back-to-back World Championship MVP awards, following in the footsteps of Cuba's Regla Torres, making her the sole player in the history of European volleyball to attain this feat. Bošković was also the most efficient attacker of the tournament, with 55.6% of the kills. In Serbia's opening match against Canada, she set a record by delivering the fastest serve in this edition, reaching a speed of 106.8 km/h. Bošković has often opted for a break following demanding national team and club seasons, considering the FIVB Volleyball Nations League not a major tournament in volleyball. This year marked her return to the VNL after skipping the last two editions, with her previous appearance in week 1 of the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League held in Belgrade, Serbia. Bošković, alongside team captain Maja Ognjenović, rejoined the Serbian team during week 3 of the 2023 FIVB Volleyball Nations League in Suwon. Over the course of four matches, she scored a total of 109 points with an impressive 58.8% success rate in her spike attempts. Bošković became the first player, both male and female, in this edition to score 39 points or more in a single match.[non-primary source needed] While she led her team to victory in three out of four matches, Serbia's team fell short of making it to the finals as they finished outside the top 8 in the preliminary round. At the 2023 Women's European Volleyball Championship, Bošković and the team advanced to the final for the fourth consecutive edition. Serbia had to settle for the silver medal after a hard-fought five-set match, narrowly missing the victory. Bošković showcased an outstanding performance, scoring 37 points in the gold medal match, yet it was not enough for the win. Despite the final outcome, she emerged as the best scorer of the tournament, tallying an impressive 229 points and surpassing her records from the previous editions she has played. Additionally, Bošković was also the best spiker in the tournament. Without delay, Bošković and Serbia swiftly traveled to China to participate in the Olympic games qualification, just a week after concluding the European Championship. Bošković and Serbia booked their place in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris at the 2023 FIVB Volleyball Women's Olympic Qualification Tournaments, emerging victorious in 6 out of 7 matches. This achievement marks Bošković's third appearance in the Olympic Games. Bošković first club was ŽOK Hercegovac, a club from Bosnia and Herzegovina, where she played in the 2010–11 season. After playing for only one season with the club, she transferred to ŽOK Partizan Vizura, a club from Serbia, at the beginning of the 2011–12 season. She left her family when she was only 14 years old and moved to Belgrade with her older sister. Bošković started playing in the Serbian League as an Outside hitter for the team. She was awarded as the Best Outside Hitter at the 2012–13 Serbian Cup. Subsequently, her role on the court evolved to that of an Opposite Spiker starting from the 2013–14 season, a transition that marked a significant chapter in her career. She was named the Most Valuable Player in the 2013–14 Serbian Super League. Overall, she has won two Serbian Super League titles (2013–14 and 2014–15), two Serbian Super Cups (2013 and 2014), and one Serbian Cup (2014–15) with the club. Bošković ended her collaboration with ŽOK Partizan Vizura in 2015, sparking widespread interest from prominent volleyball teams across Europe, particularly from Italy, Poland, and Turkey. As one of the most sought-after players during the transfer window, she received enticing offers from big clubs worldwide, including European powerhouses VakifBank, Galatasaray, and Fenerbahçe. However, at the end, Bošković ultimately made a decisive choice to join the ranks of Eczacıbaşı, one of the volleyball giants, signing a substantial four-year contract with the club. In 2016, UTSA volleyball head coach Laura Neugebauer-Groff tried to recruit Bošković to play in America for a year, along with her sister Dajana. However, with her prior commitment to Eczacıbaşı through a four-year deal, Bošković graciously declined the tempting offer, opting to remain in Turkey and continue her journey with the club. In her debut season with Eczacıbaşı, Bošković made a significant impact, securing a commendable third-place finish in the 2015–16 Turkish Volleball League.

Despite being the Best Opposite player in the 2016–17 Turkish Volleyball League, Eczacıbaşı closed the season in fourth place after losing to VakifBank, resulting in the team not being able to play in the CEV Champion League, the highest level European volleyball club tournament for next season, due to the rules that only the top 3 clubs from Turkey can take part in the tournament. In the 2016–17 CEV Champions League, Bošković and her team advanced to the Final Four held in Italy. The team defeated Dynamo Moscow in four sets to win the bronze medal. Bošković showcased her exceptional skills, topping the charts in scoring with an impressive 221 points, while her powerful serves earned her the distinction of leading in aces with a remarkable tally of 26. Despite the team's inability to win a medal, Bošković's individual performance shone at the 2017 FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship.

Her amazing performance included scoring a total of 515 points, placing her position as one of the top two scorers in the competition. Despite the team's overall result, her individual achievements continued to highlight her exceptional skills and contribution to the game.

Tijana Bošković was born to Serb parents on 8 March 1997 in Trebinje, Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bošković can speak three languages: Serbian, Turkish and English. She is the second child of Ljupko Bošković and Vesna Bošković. Her father was a football player. She has two siblings – a brother Vuk and a sister Dajana. Her younger brother, Vuk Bošković is a basketball player and her older sister Dajana Bošković plays for the Bosnia and Herzegovina women's national volleyball team. The two sisters played their first international match against each other in 2021 Women's European Volleyball Championship. Based on Bošković's social media updates, she is currently dating Djorde Orestijevic, a software engineer residing in Serbia. They both keep their personal life private, so the exact start and details of their relationship are not widely known. Bošković hails from Bosnia and Herzegovina but holds Serbian citizenship. Born in Trebinje, a city located in Republika Srpska, she has been playing for Serbia since the age of 15. Unlike naturalized players who often face a two-year waiting period after acquiring citizenship, Bošković, having Serbian citizenship already, did not undergo such a waiting period, following the rules of the International Volleyball Federation. Bošković initially ventured into sports through karate but found it less suitable due to her tall stature. Her journey into volleyball began when she attended one of her older sister's volleyball matches. Inspired by the game, she made the decision to become a volleyball player herself. Bošković transitioned to volleyball at the age of 7, during her primary school years. She quickly excelled, winning three championships with her school team. Before joining the Serbia junior team, Bošković attracted the attention of Galatasaray while playing in a match in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The club invited her and her sister, Dajana, to Istanbul, Turkey, for trial training. Accepting the offer, Bošković, along with her sister, traveled to Istanbul with their father. After showcasing her talent in training, Bošković, who was just 12 at the time, received praise from the coaches. Galatasaray's managers then approached her family with a transfer offer, including the option to acquire Turkish citizenship and play for the Turkish national team. However, her father firmly declined the offer, emphasizing that Bošković would only represent the Serbia national team. Consequently, they returned to Serbia, where she continued her promising volleyball journey. Having achieved numerous achievements and individual awards at such a young age, Tijana Bošković, the world-class volleyball player, has received widespread acknowledgment and rewards. This recognition extends beyond governmental appreciation to include non-governmental organizations, underscoring her exceptional contributions to the sport of volleyball. President Milorad Dodik of Republika Srpska announced a generous donation of KM 20,000 (US$11,000) each to the acclaimed volleyball players Tijana Bošković, Brankica Mihajlović, and Jelena Blagojević. This gesture, accompanied by appropriate gifts, comes in celebration of their remarkable achievement in securing the gold medal for the Serbian national team at the 2017 European Volleyball Championship. Following discussions with Bošković and Mihajlović, both gold medalists at the European Championship, Dodik conveyed his pride in having female volleyball players from Republika Srpska contribute to the success of the Serbian national team, emphasizing the potential this showcases for the region. Bošković extended her thanks to President Dodik and the welcoming reception they received, expressing hope for continued success and appreciation for the ongoing support. Hailing from Bileca, Bošković, the standout volleyball player born in this small town, received an extraordinary honor in 2018. The Minister of Foreign Affairs for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Igor Crnadak, presented her with a diplomatic passport at the General Consulate in Istanbul. This recognition wasn't just for her sports achievements but was part of a broader humanitarian-sports campaign. In July 2019, the sports hall in Bileća was officially named after Tijana Bošković – who took her first sporting steps in this hall, in a special ceremony led by the President of the National Assembly, Nedeljko Čubrilović and Bošković herself. During a press conference, Čubrilović expressed that Bošković's achievements serve as a great inspiration for young people in the Republic of Srpska and worldwide. He emphasized that the Republic of Srpska is committed to supporting young athletes and acknowledged that Bošković deserves even more recognition. Bošković, deeply honored by the decision, thanked the municipality of Bileća and everyone involved in this initiative. She pledged to continue representing her city and herself with excellence, striving for more successes and medals in the future. President of the Serbian Volleyball Federation, Zoran Gajić, highlighted that the facility aptly bears Bošković's name, recognizing her unwavering character from her early days in the Bileća sports hall to her current status as the best volleyball player in the world. MP Radovan Vuković proposed the idea of organizing a volleyball school or camp in Bileća, also carrying the name of Tijana Bošković, as a testament to her lasting impact on the community. In a ceremonial gesture, Serbian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ivica Dačić personally presented diplomatic passports of Serbia to the members of the Serbian national volleyball teams. Among the honored athletes were Maja Ognjenović, Tijana Bošković, Ana Bjelica, Jovana Stevanović, and Teodora Pušić. During discussions with the athletes, Minister Dačić expressed that this act serves as a token of gratitude from the state to individuals who have consistently brought medals to Serbia. Dačić further underlined that while diplomatic passports are not prerequisites for these accomplished athletes to serve as ambassadors for their country, their achievements and conduct have already established them as exemplary representatives. 2013 European Youth Olympic Festival – Silver Medal 2014 Junior European Championship – Gold Medal 2015 World Cup – Silver Medal 2015 European
