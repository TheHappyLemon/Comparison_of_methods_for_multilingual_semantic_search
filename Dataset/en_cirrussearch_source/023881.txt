Liubotyn or Lyubotyn (Ukrainian: Люботин, pronounced [lʲʊboˈtɪn]; Russian: Люботин, romanized: Lyubotin) is a city in Kharkiv Raion, Kharkiv Oblast, eastern Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Liubotyn urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 20,001 (2022 estimate). The city was established in 1650 by Ukrainian Cossacks from the right-bank Ukraine. During World War II, Liubotyn was under German occupation from 20 October 1941 to 22 February 1943 and again from 9 March to 29 August 1943. The central square in Liubotyn is Soborna Square. It is the central park, next to which is the old princely park of the early 19th century in the English style. The park has many entertainment venues and a memorial to those who died in World War II, built in 2006. The city's pride is the longest covered pedestrian railway bridge in Europe, with a total length of 260 meters. There are three Orthodox churches in the city: in Staryi Liubotyn (early 19th century), in Hiiivka (early 19th century), and in the city center (early 20th century). Until 18 July 2020, Liubotyn was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and the center of Liubotyn Municipality. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kharkiv Oblast to seven. The area of Liubotyn Municipality was merged into Kharkiv Raion. On June 19, 2022, at about 23:30, the military of the aggressor country fired a rocket at Liubotyn. As a result of two explosions, the lyceum of railway transport, where the center for the distribution of humanitarian aid was located, was damaged. A number of private houses were damaged by the shock wave and debris.
