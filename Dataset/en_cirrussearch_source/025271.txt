Smarty is a web template system written in PHP. Smarty is primarily promoted as a tool for separation of concerns. Smarty is intended to simplify compartmentalization, allowing the front-end of a web page to change separately from its back-end. Ideally, this lowers costs and minimizes the efforts associated with software maintenance. Smarty generates web content through the placement of special Smarty tags within a document. These tags are processed and substituted with other code. Tags are directives for Smarty that are enclosed by template delimiters. These directives can be variables, denoted by a dollar sign ($), functions, logical or loop statements. Smarty allows PHP programmers to define custom functions that can be accessed using Smarty tags. Since Smarty separates PHP from HTML, there are two files — one contains the presentation code: an HTML template, including Smarty variables and tags - {$title_text|escape} {$body_html} - which might look like this: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8"> <title>{$title_text|escape}</title> </head> <body> {* This is a little comment that won't be visible in the HTML source *} {$body_html} </body> <!-- this is a little comment that will be seen in the HTML source --> </html> The business logic to use the Smarty template above could be as follows: define('SMARTY_DIR', 'smarty-2.6.22/'); require_once(SMARTY_DIR . 'Smarty.class.php'); $smarty = new Smarty(); $smarty->template_dir = './templates/'; $smarty->compile_dir = './templates/compile/'; $smarty->assign('title_text', 'TITLE: This is the Smarty basic example ...'); $smarty->assign('body_html', '<p>BODY: This is the message set using assign()</p>'); $smarty->display('index.tpl'); Hasin Hayder; J.
