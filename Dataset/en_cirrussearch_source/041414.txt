The 2018 Tour of Flanders (Dutch: Ronde van Vlaanderen 2018) was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 1 April 2018 in Belgium. It was the 102nd edition of the Tour of Flanders and the thirteenth event of the 2018 UCI World Tour. Quick-Step Floors rider Niki Terpstra became the first Dutch rider since Adri van der Poel in 1986 to win the Tour of Flanders, having gone clear on the Kruisberg climb. Terpstra remained clear over the remaining 25 kilometres (16 miles), finishing 12 seconds ahead of Trek–Segafredo's Mads Pedersen, while the podium was completed by defending race-winner Philippe Gilbert, also for Quick-Step Floors. As the Tour of Flanders was a UCI World Tour event, all eighteen UCI WorldTeams were invited automatically and obliged to enter a team in the race. Seven UCI Professional Continental teams competed, completing the 25-team peloton.
