Abkhazia is a region in the Caucasus that is under the effective control of the partially recognised self-declared Republic of Abkhazia. The de jure majority internationally recognized Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia claims to be its legitimate government. The flag of the Republic of Abkhazia was created in 1991 by Valeri Gamgia. It was officially adopted on 23 July 1992.[citation needed] The design of the red canton is based on the banner of the medieval Kingdom of Abkhazia. The open right hand means "Hello to friends! Stop to Enemies!". The seven stars in the canton have since been reinterpreted to correspond to the seven historical regions of the country: Sadzen, Bzyp, Gumaa, Abzhywa, Samurzaqan, Dal-Tsabal and Pskhuy-Aibga. Seven is a number sacred to the Abkhaz and the green and white stripes represent the tolerance that allows Christianity and Islam to coexist.

A flag has been proposed by the Georgian State Council of Heraldry for the region that combines the flag of Georgia with green and white stripes of the Abkhazian flag. Flag of Georgia Proposed flag of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia The Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus was a state that declared independence in 1917 from both the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and White Russian forces during the Russian Civil War. It claimed Abkhazia as its territory, but Abkhazia was also claimed and occupied by the Democratic Republic of Georgia. The purported flag of the Mountain Republic contains several elements that would later be included in the Abkhazian flag, including seven green and white horizontal stripes and a canton with seven stars. In the North Caucasian flag, the seven stars and stripes represented the regions of Dagestan, Chechen-Ingushia, Ossetia, Abkhazia, Kabardia, Adygea, and Karachay-Balkaria. Flag of the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus (c. 1917) The flag of the SSR Abkhazia was adopted in 1925 when the SSR Abkhazia ratified its constitution. It was used until 1931, when the SSR Abkhazia was transformed into the Abkhaz ASSR with a different flag. Flag of the Socialist Soviet Republic Abkhazia (1925–31) The flag of the Abkhaz ASSR was introduced in 1978 and used until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The previous flag used between 1931 and 1978 was identical to the flag of the Georgian SSR, and in 1978 the name of the Abkhaz ASSR was added written in the Abkhaz language and script.
