He began playing professionally with Södertälje SK in the Elitserien during the 2010–11 Elitserien season and 2011 Kvalserien, before moving to Modo Hockey for a solitary season in 2013–14. On 16 April 2014, Lööv was signed to a three-year entry level contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. On 18 February 2016, following an injury to Matt Hunwick, Lööv was recalled by the Leafs on an emergency basis, and made his NHL debut the same night, in a game against the New York Rangers. Lööv recorded his first career NHL point, an assist on a goal scored by P. A. Parenteau, less than 5 minutes into the game.

Lööv would finish out the season with the Devils' AHL affiliate, the Albany Devils. Lööv re-signed with the Devils on 9 May 2017, agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract worth $650,000.
