Altdorf is a municipality in Switzerland. It is the capital of the Swiss canton of Uri and retains historic town privileges. It is the place where, according to the legend, William Tell shot the apple from his son's head. Aldorf is situated on the right (eastern) bank of the Reuss, about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) south of where the river discharges into the Urnersee, an arm of Lake Lucerne. It is at the junction of two major Alpine passes—Saint Gotthard to the south and the Klausen Pass to the east—and is the last station on the Gotthard railway before the line enters the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the world's longest railway tunnel. The official language of Altdorf is Swiss Standard German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic dialect. The municipality covers an area of 10.21 square kilometres (3.94 sq mi). The town proper sits at an altitude of 458 metres (1,503 ft) above sea level on a flat alluvial plain between the right bank of the river Reuss and the steep hillside of the Rossstock 2.4 km (1.5 mi) to the east. The scattered hamlets and pastureland of Eggbergen, about 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) above the town, also belong to the municipality. Of Altdorf's total area, about 36% is used for agricultural purposes (predominately for orchards or vineyards), 37–39% is forested, 23% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder is rivers, glaciers, or mountains. Altdorf adjoins the municipalities of Attinghausen and Seedorf across the Reuss to the west, Flüelen, the port village at the Urnersee to the north, Bürglen in the Schächental to the east and south, and Schattdorf to the south. The earliest evidence of a settlement in Altdorf are several La Tène era bronze ax-heads and iron tools from the 3rd century BCE. The people that settled in this region initially settled in the forest, and expanded toward the banks of the Reuss. When the Reuss periodically flooded, the low lying settlements were destroyed and the inhabitants were driven back to the "old town", a possible source of the name Altdorf. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire the local Gallo-Roman population of Altdorf began to mix with the Germanic Alamanni during the 7th century. The earliest evidence of this is the grave of an armed horseman (dated to 670–680) located in the local St Martin's Church. The current town was first mentioned in 1223 as Alttorf, whereas some sources from the 16th to 19th centuries occasionally refer to it as Uri. Altdorf has a population (as of 31 December 2020) of 9,565. As of 2017, 1,347 people or 14.8% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. From 2008 through 2017 the population has increased at an annual rate of 0.8%. Most of the population (as of 2000[update]) speaks German (88.3%), with Serbo-Croatian being second most common (4.2%) and Italian being third ( 2.5%). As of 2007[update] the gender distribution of the population was 48.4% male and 51.6% female. In Altdorf about 65.2% of the population (between age 25–64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Altdorf has an unemployment rate of 1.45%. As of 2005[update], there were 137 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 49 businesses involved in this sector. 1,748 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 77 businesses in this sector. 3,585 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 403 businesses in this sector. source: According to the legend, Altdorf's marketplace is the site where William Tell shot the apple from his son's head, and in 1895 sculptor Richard Kissling unveiled a bronze statue commemorating the feat at the foot of an old tower. In 1899 a theatre was opened close to the town's center for the purpose of performing Schiller's play of Wilhelm Tell. In 1905 a Museum was opened on Gottardstrasse just south of the centre of the town that houses a collection of local antiquities, weapons and regional furniture, as well as a collection of portraits of important Uri citizens, including fine ones by the Andermatt-born Felix Maria Diogg (1762–1834). There are several paintings here by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) whose family came from Hospental, including portraits of Pope Pius X, Pope Pius XI, Cardinal Merry del Val, the artist's father Alois Muller, his uncle Domherr Josef Muller, and a large allegorical work Alpenrose und Edelweiss. The museum was extended in the 1990s. Recently the town has established the Haus für Kunst Uri at Herrengasse 2 in a partly converted historic house with a large contemporary extension creating an attractive exhibition space. The work of Swiss and international contemporary artists from Uri is exhibited here, and they sometimes have exhibitions of earlier historical art.
