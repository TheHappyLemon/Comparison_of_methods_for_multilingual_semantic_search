This is the full medal table of the 1924 Summer Olympics which were held in Paris, France. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silvers is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This follows the system used by the IOC, IAAF and BBC.   *   Host nation (France) "Paris 1924". Olympics.com. International Olympic Committee. "1924 Summer Olympics". Olympedia.com.
