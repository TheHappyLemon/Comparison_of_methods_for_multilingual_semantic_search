The 1900 Summer Olympics were held in Paris, France, from May 14 to October 28, 1900, as part of the 1900 World's Fair. A total of 1226 athletes representing 25 nations participated in 95 events in 19 sports at these games. Women competed in the Olympics for the first time during the 1900 games. 20 of the 25 participating nations earned medals, in addition to 19 medals won by mixed teams, i.e. teams made up of athletes from multiple nations. The host nation of France flooded the field, comprising over 72% of all the athletes (720 of the 997); given this, America dominated athletically, winning the second-most gold (19), silver (14), and bronze (15) medals, while fielding 75 athletes. In the early Olympic Games, several team events were contested by athletes from multiple nations. Retroactively, the IOC created the designation Mixed team (with the country code ZZX) to refer to these groups of athletes. During the 1900 games, athletes participating in mixed teams won medals in athletics, cricket, football, polo, rowing, rugby, sailing, tennis, tug of war, and water polo. The 1900 Olympics is unique in being the only Olympic Games to feature rectangular medals, which were designed by Frédérique Vernon. Gilt silver medals were awarded for 1st place in shooting, lifesaving, automobile racing and gymnastics. Whilst 2nd place silver medals were awarded in shooting, rowing, yachting, tennis, gymnastics, sabre, fencing, equestrian and athletics. With 3rd place bronze medals being awarded in gymnastics, firefighting and shooting. In many sports, however, medals were not awarded. With most of the listed prizes were cups and other similar trophies. The International Olympic Committee has retrospectively assigned gold, silver, and bronze medals to competitors who earned first, second, and third-place finishes in order to bring early Olympics in line with current awards. This is the full table of the medal count of the 1900 Summer Olympics, based on the medal count of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Before July 2021, the IOC did not decide which events were "Olympic" and which were not. These rankings use Olympic medal table sorting.   Host nation (France)   First ever medal Also had fellow-countrymen in mixed teams that won medals. These medals are included in the table for "Mixed team" (ZZX). Medal-winning mixed teams also included athletes from Mexico, Haiti, New Zealand, and Colombia. "Paris 1900". International Olympic Committee. Retrieved 2018-05-18. NOCs: 24 Athletes: 997 (22 women, 975 men) Events: 95 The IOC page, "Paris 1900", affirms a total of 95 medal events, which has been the recommendation of Olympic historian Bill Mallon regarding events that should be considered "Olympic". The previous IOC database contained at least ten fewer events. The IOC has never made any decision on which events are Olympic and which are not. In 2016, the IOC obtained the rights to the OlyMADMen database (at Olympedia.org – the source of the sports-reference.com data), which was created and maintained by Bill Mallon. IOC substituted the OlyMADMen data for the earliest Olympics. See Mallon, Bill (August 16, 2016). "The OlyMADMen and OlympStats and Sports-Reference". We have more data and stats and expertise on the Olympics than any similar group. We have far more than what can be found in Wikipedia, just for starters. You may know of the www.sports-reference.com/olympics site (SR/olympics), which is very good, but that is actually also our site ... We have completed discussions with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to have them use www.olympedia.org as part of their Olympic Statistical Database. Because of this, the SR/olympics site will eventually mostly close down. "Paris 1900–Games of the II Olympiad". International Olympic Committee. Retrieved 2018-05-12.

In the croquet doubles, very little is known about the event, except for the winning pair: it is not known if any other pairs entered. In most of the sailing classifications, two races were contested weeks apart. Each of these races is considered to be a final event, according to the IOC, with a set of medalists for each.

In many works, it is read that the IOC later met to decide which events were Olympic and which were not. This is not correct and no decision has ever been made.
