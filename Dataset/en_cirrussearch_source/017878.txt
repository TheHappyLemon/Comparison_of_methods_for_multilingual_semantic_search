Chris Anker Sørensen (Danish pronunciation: [ˈkʰʁis ˈɑŋkɐ ˈsɶɐ̯ˀn̩sn̩]; 5 September 1984 – 18 September 2021) was a Danish road bicycle racer who rode professionally between 2005 and 2018 for the Team Designa Køkken, Tinkoff–Saxo, Fortuneo–Vital Concept, and Riwal Platform teams. Sørensen then worked as a directeur sportif (and co-owner) for his final professional team, Riwal Readynez. Born in Hammel, Sørensen had a promising performance in the 2008 Tour of Austria, finishing fourth overall. A few weeks later, he competed for Denmark (along with Nicki Sørensen and Brian Vandborg) in the 2008 Olympic road race, finishing 12th overall. Starting with the 2010 season, Sørensen, who lived in Luxembourg, rode under a Luxembourg license, since the UCI no longer allowed the Danish federation to grant Danish licenses to riders living abroad. During the season, he won Stage 8 of the Giro d'Italia. In the 2012 Tour de France, Sørensen finished 14th overall and was awarded the super-combativity award after an attacking performance in several mountain stages. In September 2015, it was announced that he would leave Tinkoff–Saxo and join Fortuneo–Vital Concept for the 2016 season, with a role to support Eduardo Sepúlveda in Grand Tours. In February 2018, he announced his retirement at the end of the season. He commentated on TV 2 (Denmark) from 2017 until his death. On 18 September 2021, Sørensen was killed by injuries sustained by being struck by a van while on a bike ride in Zeebrugge, Belgium; he had been due to cover the 2021 UCI Road World Championships, which started the following day. According to a statement of the Brugge parket released on 19 September, Sørensen did not yield on a location where he needed to do so. 2001 3rd Road race, National Junior Road Championships 2005 1st Stage 3 Ringerike GP 2006 4th Road race, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 4th Overall Triptyque des Barrages 5th GP Demy–Cars 6th Grand Prix de Waregem 7th Omloop van het Waasland 8th Grand Prix Cristal Energie 2007 6th Overall Deutschland Tour 1st Stage 2 (TTT) 7th Rund um die Hainleite 2008 1st Stage 6 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré 3rd Grand Prix d'Isbergues 4th Overall Tour of Austria 1st Stage 2 2009 1st Japan Cup 2nd Road race, National Road Championships 5th Overall Tour du Haut Var 6th GP Miguel Induráin 8th Giro dell'Emilia 2010 1st Stage 8 Giro d'Italia 3rd Overall Tour of Slovenia 5th Road race, National Road Championships 6th Overall Tour du Haut Var 2011 1st Mountains classification Tour de Romandie 5th Road race, National Road Championships 6th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 8th Overall Tour du Haut Var 2012 1st Mountains classification Volta a Catalunya 5th Road race, National Road Championships 5th Giro dell'Emilia 8th Milano–Torino Combativity award Overall Tour de France 2013 2nd Giro dell'Emilia 10th Overall Tour de Pologne 2015 1st Road race, National Road Championships 9th Overall Tour of Britain 2016 5th Overall Tour La Provence 2017 4th Overall Kreiz Breizh Elites 9th Sundvolden GP 2018 10th Lillehammer GP List of racing cyclists and pacemakers with a cycling-related death "Chris Anker Sørensen bliver medejer af Riwal - CeramicSpeed Cycling Team" [Chris Anker Sørensen joins the Riwal - CeramicSpeed Cycling Team].
