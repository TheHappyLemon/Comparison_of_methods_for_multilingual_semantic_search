Adriano Malori (born 28 January 1988) is an Italian former road racing cyclist, who rode professionally between 2010 and 2017 for the Lampre–Merida and Movistar Team squads. Malori was the lanterne rouge of the 2010 Tour de France, finishing almost four and a half hours behind winner Andy Schleck (Leopard Trek). Having ridden for the Lampre–Merida squad since August 2009, Malori left the team at the end of the 2013 season to join the Movistar Team. He won the final time trial of the 2014 Vuelta a España. On 23 January 2016, at the Tour de San Luis, Malori suffered a severe crash as he was leading the peloton. His front wheel was caught in a crack on the road and he flew over his bike, crashing head-first. He was put in an induced coma. Three days later, he was moved to a special clinic in Buenos Aires. Reports suggested that doctors had found the head trauma not to be a result, but rather the cause of the crash, citing a possible aneurysm. However, the team discredited them soon afterward, saying a road defect was the cause of the crash. In August, Malori announced that he would make his return to racing the following month at the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec and Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal. Malori announced his retirement from professional cycling on 10 July 2017, as a result of the injury. 2006 National Junior Road Championships 1st Time trial 2nd Road race 3rd Overall Giro della Lunigiana 6th Road race, UEC European Junior Road Championships 2007 1st Time trial, National Under-23 Road Championships 3rd Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 5th Time trial, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 2008 1st Time trial, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 1st Time trial, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 1st Time trial, National Under-23 Road Championships 1st Chrono Champenois 1st Trofeo Città di Castelfidardo 2nd Coppa della Pace 3rd Memorial Davide Fardelli 2009 1st Time trial, Mediterranean Games 1st Chrono Champenois 1st Stage 1a (TTT) Giro della Valle d'Aosta 2nd Time trial, National Under-23 Road Championships 3rd Gran Premio San Giuseppe 5th Time trial, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 2010 2nd Overall Bayern Rundfahrt 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships 2011 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 5th Overall Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 1st Stage 4 (ITT) 2012 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships 10th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 2013 1st Overall Bayern Rundfahrt 1st Stage 4 (ITT) 1st Stage 4 (ITT) Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships 8th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 2014 1st Time trial, National Road Championships Vuelta a España 1st Stages 1 (TTT) & 21 (ITT) Combativity award Stage 21 1st Stage 7 (ITT) Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Stage 5 (ITT) Tour de San Luis 1st Stage 3 Route du Sud 6th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships 7th Overall Dubai Tour 2015 1st Time trial, National Road Championships 1st Stage 1 (ITT) Tirreno–Adriatico 1st Stage 5 (ITT) Tour de San Luis UCI Road World Championships 2nd Time trial 3rd Team time trial 2nd Overall Tour du Poitou-Charentes 1st Stage 4 (ITT) 3rd Overall Circuit de la Sarthe 1st Stage 2b (ITT) 7th Chrono des Nations "Malori, rumbo al Movistar Team" [Malori, direction of the Movistar Team].
