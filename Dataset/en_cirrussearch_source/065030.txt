Defining Europe as holding “maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances“, Kaplan is a strong advocate of cross-cultural management education. He furthermore is in favor of an EU commissioner for happiness. Kaplan has teaching experience in top-tier schools and universities such as Harvard University, Sciences Po Paris, and Tsinghua University. Kaplan started doing research in the areas of mass customization, innovation, customer lifetime valuation, and relationship marketing. Since then, his research mainly deals with analyzing and decrypting the digital sphere. With more than 37,000 citations on Google Scholar, Kaplan was counted amongst the Top 50 Business and Management authors in the world according to John Wiley & Sons. In 2020, Andreas Kaplan ranked in a Stanford study of the world's top 2% of scientists. Kaplan received the annual Best Article Award from Business Horizons, sponsored by Elsevier, for his 2012 paper "If you love something, let it go mobile: Mobile marketing and mobile social media 4x4". In particular, his 2010 article co-authored with Michael Haenlein "Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of social media" published in Business Horizons is widely cited (over 25,000 times on Google Scholar and over 6,000 times in Scopus) and known in the field. This seminal article "Users of the World, Unite!" recurrently achieved first place in Science Direct's annual list of the 25 most downloaded publications across all 24 core subject areas covered in Science Direct, ranging from management to engineering, psychology, or neuroscience and thus was downloaded more often than any other of the approximately 13.4 million papers in the collection. More recent research deals with the influence of the digital sphere on higher education, such as the arrival of MOOCs and SPOCs, as well as in the area of artificial intelligence.
