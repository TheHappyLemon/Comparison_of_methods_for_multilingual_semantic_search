Anish Kumar Giri (Nepali: अनीश कुमार गिरी; Russian: Аниш Кумар Гири; born 28 June 1994) is a Dutch chess grandmaster. A chess prodigy, he completed the requirements for the grandmaster title in 2009 at the age of 14 years, 7 months and 2 days. Giri is a five-time Dutch champion (2009, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2023) and won the Corus Chess B Group in 2010. He has represented the Netherlands at six Chess Olympiads (2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2022). He has also won major international tournaments, including the 2012 Reggio Emilia tournament, 2017 Reykjavik Open, 2023 Tata Steel Chess, and shared 1st place in the 2015 London Chess Classic. In 2019 he won clear first at the Third Edition of the Shenzhen Masters. As of September 2023,[update] Anish Giri is the No. 1 ranked player in the Netherlands, having switched from Russia in 2009. In 2021 Wijk aan Zee, Giri tied for first place with fellow Dutch GM Jorden van Foreest, but lost to him in the armageddon round after the two blitz games in the playoff ended in a draw. During the 2023 Tata Steel chess tournament, Giri edged out Nodirbek Abdusattorov on the last day to win the event, becoming the fourth Dutch player since 1968 (after Gennadi Sosonko, Jan Timman, and Jorden van Foreest), and 14th Dutch player overall, to do so. Giri was born in Saint Petersburg on 28 June 1994 to a Russian mother, Olga, and Nepali father, Sanjay Giri. His paternal grandmother is from India. He moved to Sapporo, Japan with his parents in 2002 and lived there until 2008. Since February 2008, Giri and his family have lived in the Dutch town of Rijswijk, where his father worked at a research and consulting foundation. In June 2013, Giri graduated from Grotius College in Delft. Giri began playing chess with his mother at age six. By age 11, he was rated above 2100 and continued to grow stronger. Giri's first club was a local youth sport club DYUSH-2 in Saint Petersburg, where his trainers were Asya Kovalyova and Andrei Praslov. He was a member of the Japan Chess Association and Sapporo Chess Club during his stay in Japan. In 2004, he won the Sapporo Chess Championship. Giri developed quickly as a junior, his rating increasing rapidly between April 2006 and July 2010 from 2114 to 2672. Giri worked with trainer Vladimir Chuchelov between 2009–2012 and resumed in 2017. Giri also worked with Vladimir Tukmakov between 2013 and 2016.[citation needed] Giri shared first place in the Russian Higher League Under-14s Boys Championship scoring 6½/9, winning the Saint Petersburg Boys Under 16s and coming third in the Under 18s event in 2007. The next year saw him share first at the Blokadny Saint Petersburg Open and win the Petrograd Winter Open scoring 8½/9. He followed with his first Grandmaster norm, achieved at the Intomart GfK Open sharing first with 7/9 in April 2008, sharing second at Kunsthalle GM Open and reaching his second Grandmaster norm at Groningen by sharing fourth place with 6½/9. Giri's first appearance at a major tournament came in his shared second place at Corus Chess Group C in January 2009 giving him his third GM norm, his Grandmaster status being confirmed in June. He also shared second at the Dutch Open, won the Dutch Championship and shared second at the Unive tournament. His performance in the previous year's Corus Chess Group C earned him a spot in Group B in 2010. He won the tournament with a score of 9/13, half a point ahead of Arkadij Naiditsch. Despite a disappointing result in the European Individual Championships, he drew a match with Nigel Short and won the Sigeman & Co tournament scoring 4½/5, coming second in the Dutch Championships behind Erwin L'Ami and was one of the best scorers for the Rising Stars team during the NH tournament against the Experienced team, but was unable to qualify for the Melody Amber tournament, losing on tiebreaks against Hikaru Nakamura. It was revealed in May 2010 that Giri had aided Viswanathan Anand in preparation for the World Chess Championship 2010 against challenger Veselin Topalov. Anand won the match 6½–5½ to retain the title. At his debut appearance at Tata Steel in 2011 he scored 6½/13 (+2–2=9) and defeated Magnus Carlsen with Black in 22 moves. He also became Dutch champion for the second time and shared first place at Sigeman & Co with Wesley So and Hans Tikkanen. Despite being the lowest ranked player, Giri won the 2012 Reggio Emilia chess tournament, claimed his third Dutch championship and shared third place at the strong Biel Chess Festival. His solid improvement continued with fourth place at the Reykjavik Open and a match victory against Vassily Ivanchuk at Leon in 2013. Giri took part in the 2012/13 FIDE Grand Prix cycle, but failed to qualify for the Candidates Tournament.[citation needed] In 2014 Giri shared second place at the Tata Steel tournament, won individual bronze for his first board performance at the 41st Chess Olympiad in Tromso and finished second at the strong Qatar Masters Open. In February 2015, Giri briefly crossed the 2800 mark in the live FIDE ratings by beating Peter Svidler at the FIDE Grand Prix in Tbilisi, but did not maintain the ranking level until the end of the month to appear in the official ratings. Giri participated in the 2014/15 FIDE Grand Prix cycle, but again failed to qualify for the Candidates Tournament. In March 2016, Giri participated in the Candidates Tournament 2016 in Moscow after qualifying (for the first time) as one of the two players with the highest average ratings for 2015. At the tournament, he drew all 14 games. He went to the tournament with his wife Sopiko Guramishvili and his coach Vladimir Tukmakov.

The tournament was a 16-player event, and he was eliminated from the tournament after an upset loss to the lowest ranked player, GM Daniil Dubov in the first round. In December 2019, Giri qualified for the Candidates Tournament 2020 as a player with the highest FIDE rating for the 12 months period (January–December 2019). In the rating list, Giri led Vachier-Lagrave by an average of 6 points.[citation needed] Giri played in the Candidates Tournament 2020 which was suspended at the halfway point due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time he was on shared third place, with 3½/7, one point behind the two leaders. His second during the event was Erwin l'Ami.

At the 83rd Tata Steel Masters held in January, Giri shared first place with Jorden van Foreest on a score of 8½/13 (+4-0=9). The tie-break involved two blitz games, followed by an armageddon game if scores were level after blitz. They drew both blitz tie-breaks and Giri lost the armageddon game when he ran out of time, despite van Foreest blundering a pawn and then a bishop in the frantic time scramble. Giri finished as the runner-up of the tournament. Giri won the 2021 Magnus Carlsen Invitational, a non-FIDE-rated online tournament, after defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi in the finals in tie-breaks. From 12 to 16 May 2021, Giri participated in the second edition of the MrDodgy Invitational, a blitz tournament. The top-seeded Giri defeated Baadur Jobava in the finals to clinch first place for the second time in a row. At the Chess World Cup 2021, the 4th seeded Giri was defeated in an upset by 68th seed Nodirbek Abdusattorov.

At the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2023, Giri beat Magnus Carlsen in classical chess for the first time in 12 years. Giri later defeated World Chess Champion Ding Liren and ended in round 13 by defeating the Hungarian Grandmaster Richárd Rapport. His victory against Ding contributed to Ding's rating dropping below 2800, which left only Magnus Carlsen with a rating above 2800. Giri went on to win the event. Giri once again defeated Ding during the Superbet Chess Classic Romania leg of the Grand Chess Tour 2023, their first game since Ding's victory in the World Chess Championship 2023. At the 2023 Dutch championship, Giri claimed his 5th championship title by defeating Jorden van Foreest in rapid tiebreaks following draws in the classical portion of the match. At the Chess World Cup 2023, the 5th seeded Giri was upset by the 69th seeded Nijat Abasov in the third round in tiebreaks. He had defeated Arseniy Nesterov in the second round in tiebreaks, and he had a tie in the first round. Anish Giri finished joint first place in the Tata Steel tournament with 8.5 points from 13 games (5 wins, 7 draws, 1 loss) but lost to the eventual runner-up Gukesh D in the tiebreaker semifinals. Giri, then, took part in the returning Shenzhen Masters, which he had won in 2019, but finished 7th out of 8 players with 2.5/7, losing 3 games and winning one against GM Vladislav Artemiev in round 1, thus losing 17 rating points and dropping out of the Top 10. Giri has represented the Netherlands at six Chess Olympiads earning three individual bronze medals and scoring a total of 35 points from 49 games(+23-2=24). Giri has also competed in a World Team Championship, two European Team Championships and a World Cities Championship, earning a team gold medal in the World Cities Championship: Giri has played for numerous clubs in team tournaments including SK Turm Emsdetten since 2008 in the Chess Bundesliga, HSG (Hilversum Chess Society), the Delftsche SchaakClub (Delft Chess Club), HMC Calder and En Passant.

He has participated and won the prestigious European Club Cup with Azeri SOCAR and Russian Siberia. Giri's playstyle has been described as "solid and conservative" in chess terms. This makes him very difficult to defeat, but also leads to him often losing the chance to convert an advantage into a victory. Nonetheless his peers acknowledge his strengths as a player, with Grandmaster Arkadij Naiditsch opining that beating Magnus Carlsen is easier than beating Giri.
