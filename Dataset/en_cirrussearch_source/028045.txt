Kashgar Prefecture, also known as Kashi Prefecture, is located in southwestern Xinjiang, China, located in the Tarim Basin region (roughly the southern half of Xinjiang). It has an area of 112,057 km2 (43,265 sq mi) and 4,496,377 inhabitants at the 2020 census with a population density of 35.5 inhabitants/km2. The capital of the prefecture is the city of Kashgar which has a population 506,640. Kashgar Prefecture borders the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region of Tajikistan, Badakhshan Province of Afghanistan, Gilgit-Baltistan of Pakistan and Ladakh of India in the far south. After the Communist takeover, Kashgar Prefecture (喀什專區) and Yarkant Prefecture (莎車專區) were established. In 1902, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck the prefecture. It caused extreme devastation, destroying 30,000 homes and killing as many as 10,000 people. One of the most mysterious events that occurred in the early 1950s (and perhaps earlier), was the closure of the Indian Consulate in Kashgar. In 1955, Barin, Jamaterek and Ujme, which were part of Yengisar County, became part of Akto County and Bulungkol was transferred to Akto County in Kizilsu from Tashkurgan County in today's Kashgar Prefecture. In June 1956, Yarkant Prefecture was dissolved and made part of Kashgar Prefecture. In January 1979, Kashgar zhuānqū Prefecture (喀什专区) became Kashgar dìqū Prefecture (喀什地区). In August 1982, Kashgar Prefecture opened a frontier post to exchange goods with Pakistan.: 223  In 1992, it was proposed for 500,000 persons displaced by the Three Gorges Dam project, primarily Han Chinese, to be relocated to Kashgar Prefecture. The plans were met with widespread criticism in Xinjiang and internationally and were dropped. In February 2002, a 6.7 magnitude earthquake killed 267 people in Maralbexi County and Payzawat County. After a lengthy detention, in December 2009, Alimujiang Yimiti / Alimjan Yimit, Uyghur leader of an unregistered Christian church, was sentenced to 15 years in jail by the Kashgar Prefecture Intermediate People's Court for "illegally providing state secrets or intelligence to foreign entities". In 2008, his detention was ruled in violation of international standards of due process by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. Most of the prefecture has a cold desert climate. The second-highest peak on Earth, K2, is located on the China–Pakistan border in southern Kashgar Prefecture in an area claimed by India as part of the Trans-Karakoram Tract. As of the end of 2017, 4,295,200 of the 4,649,700 residents of the prefecture were Uyghur, 288,000 were Han Chinese and 66,500 were from other ethnic groups. The population of Kashgar Prefecture was 4,499,158 according to the 2015 census. It has a population density of 35.5 inhabitants per km2. As of 2015, 4,140,255 of the 4,499,158 residents of the prefecture were Uyghur, 292,972 were Han Chinese and 65,931 were from other ethnic groups. The population growth of Kashgar declined significantly between 2015 and 2018. As of 1999, 89.37% of the population of Kashgar (Kasi) Prefecture was Uyghur and 9.1% of the population was Han Chinese. In 1997, the population of Kashgar Prefecture was 3,145,000 with Uyghurs making up 89.4% of the total. As of 1983–4, Kashgar Prefecture had 6,180 mosques. In the mid-1980's, there were two million Uyghurs in Kashgar Prefecture and 360,000 Han Chinese.: 224  Population by ethnicity Historical English-language maps including modern-day Kashgar Prefecture area: Map including Kashgar (1917) Map including Kashgar and surrounding region from the International Map of the World (AMS, 1966) From the Operational Navigation Chart; map including Kashgar Prefecture area (DMA, 1980) Map including Kashgar Prefecture area (northwest) (DMA, 1984) "Territory ceded by Pakistan to China in 1963 and never recognized by India" (Trans-Karakoram Tract in southern Kashgar Prefecture) First East Turkestan Republic Shaksgam River Tumxuk From map: "DELINEATION OF INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARIES MUST NOT BE CONSIDERED AUTHORITATIVE" From map: "The representation of international boundaries is not necessarily authoritative."

Concerning Xinjiang, the China Daily announced on 5 December 1992 that the Peking authorities had chosen the Kashgar region as the new home for almost 500,000 Chinese who would be displaced by the immense Three Gorges Dam project. Once the massive dam on the Yangtze river is operative, a great deal of farmland in central China's Hubei province will be permanently under water. When the final go-ahead is obtained for the project, says the official Chinese daily, 100,000 Chinese farmers will immediately be relocated in Kashgar prefecture, which is expected to absorb 480,000 in the long run. It goes without saying that a population transfer on this scale runs a real risk of further destabilizing an area where, as we have already seen, considerable Chinese Han immigration has taken place since the 1950s.
