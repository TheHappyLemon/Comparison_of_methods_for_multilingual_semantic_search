Nicolas Kiesa (born 3 March 1978) is a Danish racing driver of Italian descent. He participated in five Formula One Grands Prix in the 2003 season, scoring no championship points, but finishing every race. Previously, he had won the 2003 Formula 3000 race at Monaco, when Björn Wirdheim slowed on the last lap on the front straight to greet his team. He returned to Formula One in 2005, replacing Robert Doornbos as Jordan's third driver for the German Grand Prix and for the rest of the season. Kiesa drove for the Minardi team for five races in 2003, taking the seat vacated after Justin Wilson moved to Jaguar. He made his debut in the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, which he finished in 12th position. Kiesa finished all five races, his best result being 11th in the USA Grand Prix at Indianapolis, but did not outqualify his teammate Jos Verstappen at any race.[citation needed] (key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap.)
