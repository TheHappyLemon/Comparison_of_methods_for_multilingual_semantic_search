The 2020 Paris–Nice was a road cycling stage race that was held between 8 and 14 March 2020 in France. It was the 78th edition of Paris–Nice and the fifth race of the 2020 UCI World Tour. The race was shortened on 13 March, removing the final stage, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. The global health situation had already led to the withdrawal of several teams before and during the race. German rider Maximilian Schachmann won the overall classification after the race was ended following the seventh stage. Belgian Tiesj Benoot was second, Colombian Sergio Higuita third. Seventeen teams participated in the race, including twelve UCI WorldTour teams and five UCI Professional Continental teams. Several teams originally scheduled to take part in the race withdrew due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including Astana, CCC Team, Mitchelton–Scott, Movistar Team, Team Ineos, Team Jumbo–Visma, and UAE Team Emirates. During the race, many riders and teams chose to pull out, including Bahrain–McLaren, Israel Start-Up Nation, and defending world road race champion Mads Pedersen, due to various coronavirus-related reasons. As a result, of the 136 riders who started the race, only 61 riders finished.
