The 2013 NBA draft was held on June 27, 2013, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. State Farm was the presenting sponsor. The lottery took place on May 21, 2013. This was the first draft for New Orleans under their new Pelicans name after playing as the New Orleans Hornets previously. It would also be the last draft for the Charlotte Bobcats under their old name, as they resumed playing under their old Hornets moniker that they last used in 2002 once the 2013–14 NBA season was over. Anthony Bennett, the first pick in the draft, had a very limited amount of media outlets considering him as a potential #1 pick in the draft. He bounced around the league and then was finally released by the Brooklyn Nets in January 2017 after averaging just 5.2 PPG. The highlight of the draft was the Milwaukee Bucks’ selection of Giannis Antetokounmpo with the 15th overall pick. The draft also included the first Canadian number one overall selection (Anthony Bennett), the first Canadian pair of lottery picks (Bennett and Kelly Olynyk), the first Iranian draft choice (Arsalan Kazemi), the first New Zealander first round pick (Steven Adams), and the final first round draft selections announced by then-NBA commissioner David Stern, the last of which included a visit by Hakeem Olajuwon, the first pick Stern ever announced from the 1984 NBA draft. He was replaced by current commissioner Adam Silver beginning with the 2014 NBA draft. Nationality indicates the player's national team or representative nationality. If a player has not competed at the international level, then the nationality indicates the national team which the player is eligible to represent according to FIBA rules. Erik Murphy was born in France to an American father and a Finnish mother. He has dual U.S. and Finnish citizenship, but has chosen to represent Finland internationally. These players were not selected in the 2013 NBA draft but have played at least one game in the NBA. The draft is conducted under the eligibility rules established in the league's new 2011 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with its players union. The CBA that ended the 2011 lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but called for a committee of owners and players to discuss future changes. As of 2012[update], the basic eligibility rules for the draft are listed below. All drafted players must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft. In terms of dates, players eligible for the 2013 draft must be born on or before December 31, 1994. Any player who is not an "international player", as defined in the CBA, must be at least one year removed from the graduation of his high school class. The CBA defines "international players" as players who permanently resided outside the U.S. for three years prior to the draft, did not complete high school in the U.S., and have never enrolled at a U.S. college or university. Player who are not automatically eligible must declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before the draft. For the 2013 draft, this date fell on April 28. Under NCAA rules, players will only have until April 16 to withdraw from the draft and maintain their college eligibility. A player who has hired an agent will forfeit his remaining college eligibility, regardless of whether he is drafted. Also, while the CBA allows a player to withdraw from the draft twice, the NCAA mandates that a player who has declared twice loses his college eligibility. Forty-five college players declared for the draft. Steven Adams – C, Pittsburgh (freshman) C. J.

The lottery determined the three teams that will obtain the first three picks on the draft. The remaining first-round picks and the second-round picks were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win–loss record in the previous season. Below were the chances for each team to get specific picks in the 2013 draft lottery, rounded to three decimal places. ^ 1: Toronto Raptors' pick was conveyed to the Oklahoma City Thunder.
