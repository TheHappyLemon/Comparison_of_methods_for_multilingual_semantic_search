She initially attended Cheongdam Elementary School in Seoul before moving to New Zealand. When she was eight years old, she went on a trip with her family to Australia and New Zealand. When her mother asked her if she liked New Zealand and wanted to stay, Jennie replied "yes". One year later, she was sent to study at Waikowhai Intermediate School in Auckland and lived with a home-stay family.

Jennie told Elle Indonesia that Chanel was a part of her life from a young age and that she still remembered her first memory involving the fashion house: "I remember when I was little, I look through my mother's wardrobe, and search for whatever vintage Chanel I could find". For her solo debut, she was involved in planning and styling her own wardrobe and put together more than 20 outfits for the music video of "Solo". Jennie recalled in an interview with Billboard that during the music video filming, she considered the way each would fit the song and what she could change, which helped her to learn many new ways of approaching fashion. She stated in an interview with Elle Korea that fashion became an important aspect in her career as she tried to convey the message of her music both aurally and visually. Although Jennie has been noted for her chic and strong image on stage, her off-stage personality is characterized by a cute reversal charm. She describes herself as "quiet" and "shy", especially around strangers. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar, Jennie remarked, "My personality may be what people think about my personality. But rather than being a person that other people have branded me as, I want to be a good individual who thinks for herself". Jung Chul-min, producer of Village Survival, the Eight, described Jennie as "really funny": "Contrary to the charisma she shows on stage, she is a shy person who has girlish, baby-like charms. Jennie gets more comfortable with each episode, she brings out more fun and enjoys it even more". When asked by Elle Korea about being described as "icon" and "unique", Jennie responded that "it's really an honor to be an inspiration and iconic being for someone. When you express me with these words, I feel like [I need] to look nicer and better". Jennie, instrumental in Blackpink's fashion image, has been nicknamed "Human Gucci" and "Human Chanel". Her style portfolio ranges from Gucci and Saint Laurent to niche labels such as Marine Serre and Richard Quinn.
