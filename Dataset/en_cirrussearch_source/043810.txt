There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league and this is particularly the case in Football Superleague of Kosovo, where the game between Gjilani and Drita is known as the Kosovo Derby. The derby according to the tradition of the city of Gjilan, the party starts with fans organization, who try to give the maximum that besides the support for the respective clubs, there is also some surprise for the other opponent camp, to say that we were better and is appreciated more than what is presented to you with great curiosity about the whole city, what a presentation will be on the weekend from Skifterat (Falcons) and Intelektualët (Intellectuals). Three days before the match the derby gives the atmosphere a night life, streets, everywhere in the cafe bars is an atmosphere that occurs only during national holidays, where fans are seen by both the Skifterat (Falcons) and Intelektualët (Intellectuals) to live all that week under the fever of the much-anticipated derby. One hour before the match, the two camps are organized in groups and always avoid eventual incidents between the two ultras groups. They divide the streets from where they will go to the stadium, which is good in a way to avoid the breakdown of this holiday and the much anticipated confrontation in Gjilan.
