The raptor subfamily Perninae includes a number of medium-sized broad-winged species. These are birds of warmer climates, although the Pernis species (European honey buzzard and crested honey buzzard) have a more extensive range. Several of the species in this group eat mainly insects, and the honey-buzzards are specialist feeders on wasp larvae. Reptiles are also taken by several birds in this group. Several authorities consider Gypaetinae to be within or even synonymous with Perninae. Subfamily Perninae (Griffiths et al. 2007, Lerner and Mindell 2005) Lerner, Heather R. L.; Mindell, David P.
