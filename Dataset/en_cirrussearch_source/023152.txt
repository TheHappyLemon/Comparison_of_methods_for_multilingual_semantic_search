The second fictional narrative, Legend Of Ourique Miracle, Gentil Marques' version (1997), focuses on the Battle of Ourique, 1139, which was fought between Christians and Moors in the Alentejo (South of Portugal), during the Christian reconquest process. D. Afonso Henriques had planned to conquer land in the south of Portugal and also seize cattle, slaves and other booty. Despite being out numbered by Muslim forces, according to legend, the Portuguese were able in the battle, with God's help, to capture five Moorish kings and their troops. After this resounding victory D. Afonso Henriques proclaimed himself King of Portugal (or was acclaimed by his troops still on the battlefield). Accordingly from 1140 he used the denomination Portugallensis Rex (King of Portucalian or King of the Portuguese).
