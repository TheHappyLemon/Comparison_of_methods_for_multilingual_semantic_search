The dinar (/dɪˈnɑːr/) is the name of the principal currency unit in several countries near the Mediterranean Sea, with a more widespread historical use. The English word "dinar" is the transliteration of the Arabic دينار (dīnār), which was borrowed via the Syriac dīnarā, itself from the Latin dēnārius. The modern gold dinar is a projected bullion gold coin, and as of 2019[update] is not issued as an official currency by any state. The modern dinar's historical antecedents are the gold dinar and the silver dirham, the main coin of the medieval Islamic empires, first issued in AH 77 (696–697 CE) (Late Antiquity) by Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. The word "dinar" derives from the Latin word "dēnārius," a silver coin of ancient Rome, which was first minted about c. 211 BCE. The Kushan Empire introduced a gold coin known as the dīnāra in India in the 1st century AD; the Gupta Empire and its successors up to the 6th century adopted the coin. The 8th century English king Offa of Mercia minted copies of Abbasid dinars struck in 774 by Caliph Al-Mansur with "Offa Rex" centred on the reverse. The moneyer likely had no understanding of Arabic as the Arabic text contains many errors. Such coins may have been produced for trade with Islamic Spain. These coins are called a Mancus, which is also derived from the Arabic language.[citation needed] Countries currently using a currency called "dinar" or similar: 1⁄100 of the Iranian rial Countries and regions which have previously used a currency called "dinar" in the 20th century: Money portal Numismatics portal Economy of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Kelantanese dinar Islamic State dinar List of circulating currencies Middle East economic integration Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989, s.v.
