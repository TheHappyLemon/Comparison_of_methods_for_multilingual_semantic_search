In addition to host nation Brazil, 11 women's national teams qualified from six separate continental confederations. FIFA ratified the distribution of spots at the Executive Committee meeting in March 2014. Most continents use specific Olympic qualifying tournaments to allocate their spots, but two use slightly different procedures. CONMEBOL used the 2014 Copa América Femenina as a qualifier for both the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup and the Olympic tournament and, as Brazil was on the Olympics host country condition,they automatically qualified for the tournament and therefore the South American spot was given to second place in the tournament,Colombia. UEFA used the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup to determine its Olympic qualification.The top 3 european finishers at the World Cup, excluding England, qualified. When multiple European teams was eliminated on the same round,this results were a used as tie for the Olympic qualifying spots,and had the necessity to held an Olympic Qualifying Tournament to give the last spot. As Germany and France both reached at least the quarterfinals and thus obtained qualification spots (England also did so, but was ineligible for the Olympic Games). The next best finishes for the European teams were a four-way tie among 4 teams: Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, eliminated in the round of 16. With this unproceded situation, a round robin tournament to decide who would take the last spot for the Olympic Games was held and was won by Sweden. ^4 Dates and venues are those of final tournaments (or final round of qualification tournaments), various qualification stages may precede matches at these specific venues. ^5 England finished in the top three among UEFA teams in the World Cup, however England is not an IOC member and talks for them to compete as Great Britain broke down. ^6 Nations making their Olympic tournament debut The competition consisted of two stages; a group stage followed by a knockout stage.
