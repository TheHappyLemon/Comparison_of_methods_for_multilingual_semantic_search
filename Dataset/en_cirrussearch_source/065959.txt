Aaspere is a village in Haljala Parish, Lääne-Viru County, in northeastern Estonia. It is about 20 kilometres from Rakvere. Aaspere manor (German: Kattentack) was mentioned for the first time in the 16th century. The current building received its appearance around 1800. The manor is one of the finest examples in Estonia of neoclassical manor house architecture. The manor was damaged in a fire in 1966. The manor is surrounded by a grandly designed park. The last owner before the Estonian land reform in 1919 was Eduard von Dellingshausen [et], who was a strong supporter of the idea of creating a German-dominated United Baltic Duchy after World War I. Aaspere was the birthplace of physician and botanist Bernhard Saarsoo (1899–1964). "X-GIS(4) Portal". xgis.maaamet.ee. Retrieved 23 July 2021. Viirand, Tiiu (2004). Estonia. Cultural Tourism.
