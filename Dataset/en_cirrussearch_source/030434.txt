Rajeev Suri (born 10 October 1967) is an Indian born Singaporean business executive. He has been the CEO of Inmarsat since February 2021. Earlier, Suri was the CEO of Nokia (until 31 July 2020). Before being appointed to this position in May 2014, he was the CEO of Nokia Solutions and Networks (from 2009). Prior to that, he held various positions within Nokia from 1995. Suri became the CEO of Nokia when the sale of Nokia's phone division to Microsoft Mobile was completed. He replaced Stephen Elop. Rajeev Suri was born on 10 October 1967 in New Delhi, India, and was raised in Kuwait. He is a Singaporean citizen. Suri has a bachelor of engineering degree (electronics and communications) from Manipal Institute of Technology, which was then affiliated to Mangalore University. In his more than 20 years of international experience, Rajeev has worked in roles involving strategy and M&A, product marketing, sales, major account leadership, and regional and business unit leadership. He has lived in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Europe. He worked for multinational corporations in India and Nigeria before joining Nokia in 1995. Suri followed Simon Beresford-Wylie as the CEO of NSN in October 2009 after Nokia Networks and Siemens Networks was merged. He is considered a 'turnaround specialist' in the global tech circles. In November 2011, Suri announced that the company planned to eliminate 17,000 jobs by the end of 2013 to enable NSN to refocus on mobile broadband equipment, the fastest-growing segment of the market. The reductions slashed the company's work force by 23% from 74,000. The cuts followed NSN's $1.2 billion purchase of Motorola's mobile network equipment business in July 2010 (which added staff) and helped the company trim annual operating expenses by $1.35 billion by the end of 2013. In April 2014, Suri was appointed as the CEO of Nokia. This was after Nokia had bought back full control of NSN and sold Nokia's phone division to Microsoft Mobile. Suri was the second non-Finnish CEO of Nokia after Stephen Elop. In March 2020, it was announced that Suri would step down as CEO of Nokia. He was replaced by Pekka Lundmark in August 2020. On 24 February 2021, Suri was appointed as the CEO of Inmarsat, replacing Rupert Pearce. Suri is based in Singapore and London. He is married to Nina Alag Suri, a businesswoman and the founder and CEO of Singaporean startup X0pa.ai. They have two sons: Ankit and Anish.[citation needed] "Nokia Solutions and Networks - Rajeev Suri Biography". Archived from the original on 1 July 2014. "The Suri code of success".
