The Sverdrup Mountains (Norwegian: Sverdrupfjella) are a group of mountains about 80 km (50 mi) long, standing just west of the Gjelsvik Mountains in Queen Maud Land, East Antarctica. With its summit at 2,855 metres (9,367 ft), Hamartind Peak forms the highest point in the Sverdrup Mountains. First photographed from the air and roughly plotted by the Third German Antarctic Expedition (3rd GAE), 1938–1939. Mapped in detail by Norwegian cartographers from surveys and aerial photographs taken by the Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE), and again by a later Norwegian expedition. Named for Harald Sverdrup, Chairman of the Norwegian Committee for the NBSAE.
