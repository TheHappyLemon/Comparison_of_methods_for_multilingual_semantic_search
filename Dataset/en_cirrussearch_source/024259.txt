Tretikov was born in Moscow, Soviet Union. Her father is a mathematician, and her mother was a filmmaker. After moving to New York City at age 15, she learned English while waitressing and attended the University of California, Berkeley, but left before completing her degree. Her majors were computer science and art, and she researched machine learning. In 1999, Tretikov began working as a software engineer in California, where she co-authored several software patents and was a specialist in enterprise software. Tretikov started her professional career at Sun Microsystems as an engineer at the Sun-Netscape Alliance, where she worked on the Java server.[clarification needed] She then founded GrokDigital, a technology marketing company, and was later appointed chief information officer and vice president of engineering at SugarCRM Inc.

Tretikov was appointed executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in May 2014 in succession to Sue Gardner and took up the post on June 1, 2014. She had edited Wikipedia only once before her appointment. Tretikov resigned from the Wikimedia Foundation as a result of the WMF's controversial Knowledge Engine project and disagreements with the staff, with her last day being March 31, 2016. She was succeeded by Katherine Maher in March 2016. On March 16, 2016, it was announced that Tretikov had been invited by the World Economic Forum to join its Young Global Leaders community.
