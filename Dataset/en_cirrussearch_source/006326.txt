.sc is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Seychelles. The TLD was marketed to businesses in Scotland and the U.S. state of South Carolina, however, the domains are subject to Seychelles registry rules. While SCregistrars, a company which marketed .sc domains to a target audience of Scottish sites, has since closed down the .sc extension remains available through the Afilias Global platform via various well-known registrars internationally for direct registration at second-level. The domain has also been used for domain hacks, such as by the website SoundCloud (due to its initials "SC"). For example, "exit.sc" was a domain set up by SoundCloud for tracking traffic leaving its website. com.sc: commercial, for-profit organizations net.sc: network infrastructure machines and organizations edu.sc: educational institutions gov.sc: governmental institutions org.sc: miscellaneous, usually non-profit, organizations Nominet warns Scottish businesses of .sc domain names, Out-Law News, March 20, 2002 .scot – Top-level Internet domain for Scotland IANA .sc whois information .sc domain registry Accredited .sc domain registrar v t e v t e
