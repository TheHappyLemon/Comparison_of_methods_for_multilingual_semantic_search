He then went to play in the junior Canadian Hockey League the following year, where he was selected by the Western Hockey League's Portland Winterhawks in the 2009 CHL Import Draft. He would split his first season in the WHL between the Winterhawks and Lethbridge Hurricanes, having been traded to the Hurricanes on 11 January 2010 for future NHL player Luca Sbisa. He then spent a full season with Lethbridge before returning to Sweden in 2011, signing for IF Troja-Ljungby of HockeyAllsvenskan.
