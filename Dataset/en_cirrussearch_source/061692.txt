The 2021–22 Serie A (known as the Serie A TIM for sponsorship reasons) was the 120th season of top-tier Italian football, the 90th in a round-robin tournament, and the 12th since its organization under an own league committee, the Lega Serie A. Internazionale were the defending champions. On 22 May 2022, following victory in their final match against Sassuolo, Milan were crowned champions for the first time since the 2010–11 season, earning a nineteenth overall title. Twenty teams competed in the league—the top seventeen teams from the previous season and three teams promoted from the Serie B. Crotone, Benevento (both relegated after only one year in the top flight) and Parma (relegated after three years in the top flight) were relegated to the 2021–22 Serie B. On 4 May 2021, Empoli secured promotion to Serie A after a two-year absence. Six days later, Salernitana officially confirmed a return to the top flight after 22 years of absence. The final team to be promoted were Venezia, who defeated Cittadella on 27 May in the final of the promotion play-offs, returning to the top flight after a nineteen-year absence.
