The 2013–14 Bobsleigh World Cup was a multi-race tournament over the winter season for bobsleigh, organised by the FIBT, which also organised in parallel the 2013–14 Skeleton World Cup. The season started on 30 November 2013 in Calgary, Canada, and ended on 26 January 2014 in Königssee, Germany. Below is the schedule of the 2013/14 season. This edition was covering eight events on seven different tracks in five countries. The fact of having eight events in only seven tracks means that each discipline had one double race over the season.
