Judd was appointed by President Cleveland as the U.S. Consul General to Austria. In 1881, he lost a chess match with George Henry Mackenzie for the U.S. Chess Championship (+5 -7 =3), held in St. Louis. In 1887 Judd defeated Albert Hodges (+5 −2 =2) in a non-title match, held in St. Louis.

In 1890, Judd defeated US chess champion Jackson Showalter in a match in St. Louis (+7 −3 =0), but did not claim the title. In 1892, Judd lost to Jackson Showalter in a match in St, Louis (+4 −7 =3). In 1899, he lost a match against Harry Nelson Pillsbury in St. Louis (+1 −4 =0). In 1903 he won the Western Chess Association Championship (U.S. Open Chess Championship) in Chicago. At one time he was offered to play in Ajeeb, the Automaton in New York, but he did not want to leave St. Louis. The job was then offered to Albert Hodges. He played in six American Chess Congress tournaments. He took 4th place in the 2nd American Chess Congress in Cleveland in 1871 (Mackenzie won).

In 1904, Judd tried to arrange the Seventh American Chess Congress in St. Louis, with the stipulation that the US title be awarded to the winner.
