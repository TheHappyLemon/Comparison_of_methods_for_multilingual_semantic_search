Instruktsiya po Vyzhivaniyu (Instructions for Survival in English) are a Russian rock band from Tyumen, formed in 1985 by Miroslav Nemirov. The band was formed in 1985 by Miroslav Nemirov. At their first gig, the KGB declared them to be fascists and expelled them from the Komsomol and sent them to the army. In 1987, they were involved with the collective Instruktsiya po Oborone. However, Neumoev and Yegor Letov, the leader of Grazhdanskaya Oborona, did not get along well and often quarreled over political views. Grazhdanskaya Oborona's song "Society Pamyat," though primarily meant as a criticism of the right-wing group of the same name, was likely a reference to Instruktsiya po Vyzhivaniyu's album Pamyat and doubly-intended as a criticism of Neumoev's antisemitic views. Their most controversial song is "Ubit zhida" (Kill the Jew) from 1991. Neumoev has stated that the song is not antisemitic, but a Biblical reference, and that he will not play the song on Victory Day, because he feels the day is both for Russians and Jews. Neumoev had changed Nemirov's original lyrics ("kill a bull, to collect his gun") to "kill a Jew, to buy a gun," at a 1991 music festival in Moscow. Nemirov disagreed with Neumoev's changes and this incident led to his departure from the band. The band is on the Anti Defamation League's "Bigots who Rock" list.
