Karlivka (Ukrainian: Карлівка, IPA: [ˈkɑrl⁽ʲ⁾iu̯kɐ]; Russian: Карловка, romanized: Karlovka) is a city in Poltava Raion, Poltava Oblast, Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Karlivka urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 14,045 (2022 estimate). On the site of modern Karlivka in the 1670s, settlers from the Right Bank founded the settlement of Orchyk, which was part of the first Poltava hundred of the Poltava Regiment. In the first quarter of the 18th century, the lands of the Poltava Regiment between the Kolomak and Orchyk rivers were given to the general of the Russian army Johann Bernhard Weissbach. After Weisbach's death in 1735, Karlivka was presented to Field marshal Minikh, who named the settlement Minikhpol. Before the World War II, Karlivka had more than 10,000 inhabitants,and was classified as an urban-type settlement. A hospital, a polyclinic, a high school, and a school of factory training operated in the village. Until 18 July 2020, Karlivka was the administrative center of Karlivka Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Poltava Oblast to four. The area of Karlivka Raion was merged into Poltava Raion. On 26 January 2024, a new law entered into force which abolished the status of urban-type settlement, and Karlivka became a rural settlement.
