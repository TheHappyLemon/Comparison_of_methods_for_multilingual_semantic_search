Rana (derived from Latin rana, meaning 'frog') is a genus of frogs commonly known as the Holarctic true frogs, pond frogs or brown frogs. Members of this genus are found through much of Eurasia and western North America. Many other genera were formerly included here. These true frogs are usually largish species characterized by their slim waists and wrinkled skin; many have thin ridges running along their backs, but they generally lack "warts" as in typical toads. They are excellent jumpers due to their long, slender legs. The typical webbing found on their hind feet allows for easy movement through water. Coloration is mostly greens and browns above, with darker and yellowish spots. Many frogs in this genus breed in early spring, although subtropical and tropical species may breed throughout the year. Males of most of the species are known to call, but a few species are thought to be voiceless. Females lay eggs in rafts or large, globular clusters, and can produce up to 20,000 at one time. Rana species feed mainly on insects and invertebrates, but swallow anything they can fit into their mouths,[citation needed] including small vertebrates. Among their predators are egrets, crocodiles, and snakes. Some 50 to 100 extant species are now placed in this genus by various authors; many other species formerly placed in Rana are now placed elsewhere. Frost restricted Rana to the Old World true frogs and the Eurasian brown and pond frogs of the common frog R. temporaria group, although other authors disagreed with this arrangement. In 2016, a consortium of Rana researchers from throughout Europe, Asia, and North America revised the group, and reported that the arrangement of Frost (2006) resulted in nonmonophyletic groups. Yuan et al. (2016) included all the North American ranids within Rana, and used subgenera for the well-differentiated species groups within Rana. Both of these classifications are presented below. Genera recently split from Rana are Babina, Clinotarsus (including Nasirana), Glandirana, Hydrophylax, Hylarana, Lithobates, Odorrana (including Wurana), Pelophylax, Pulchrana, Sanguirana, and Sylvirana. Of these, Odorrana and Lithobates are so closely related to Rana proper, they could conceivably be included here once again. The others seem to be far more distant relatives, in particular Pelophylax. New species are still being described in some numbers. A number of extinct species are in the genus, including Rana basaltica, from Miocene deposits in China. The following species are recognised in the genus Rana: Rana amurensis (Boulenger, 1886) – Siberian tree frog, Siberian wood frog, Amur brown frog Rana arvalis – Moor frog Rana asiatica – Central Asiatic frog, Asian frog Rana aurora – Northern red-legged frog Rana boylii – Foothill yellow-legged frog Rana cascadae – Cascades frog Rana chaochiaoensis – Chaochiao frog Rana chensinensis – Asiatic grass frog, Chinese brown frog Rana chevronta – Chevron-spotted brown frog Rana coreana – Korean brown frog Rana dalmatina – Agile frog Rana draytonii – California red-legged frog Rana dybowskii – Dybowski's frog Rana graeca – Greek stream frog, Greek frog Rana hanluica Rana huanrenensis – Huanren frog Rana iberica – Iberian frog Rana italica – Italian stream frog Rana japonica – Japanese brown frog Rana jiemuxiensis – Jiemuxi brown frog Rana johnsi – Johns' groove-toed frog Rana kobai – Ryukyu brown frog Rana kukunoris – Plateau brown frog Rana latastei – Italian agile frog, Lataste's frog Rana longicrus – Taipa frog Rana luanchuanensis Rana luteiventris – Columbia spotted frog Rana macrocnemis – Long-legged wood frog, Caucasus frog, Turkish frog, Brusa frog Rana maoershanensis Rana muscosa – Southern mountain yellow-legged frog Rana neba Rana omeimontis – Omei brown frog, Omei wood frog Rana ornativentris – Montane brown frog, Nikkō frog Rana pirica – Hokkaidō frog Rana pretiosa – Oregon spotted frog Rana pseudodalmatina †Rana pueyoi Rana pyrenaica – Pyrenean frog, Pyrenees frog Rana sakuraii – Stream brown frog, Napparagawa frog Rana sauteri – Sauter's brown frog, Kanshirei village frog, Taiwan groove-toed frog, Taiwan pseudotorrent frog Rana sangzhiensis – Sangzhi frog, Sangzhi groove-toed frog Rana shuchinae – Sichuan frog Rana sierrae – Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog, Sierra Nevada Mountain yellow-legged frog Rana tagoi – Tago's brown frog Rana tavasensis – Tavas frog Rana temporaria – Common frog, European common frog, European common brown frog, European grass frog Rana tsushimensis – Tsushima brown frog, Tsushima leopard frog Rana uenoi Rana ulma – Okinawa frog Rana zhengi Rana zhenhaiensis – Zhenhai brown frog The following fossil species are also known: †Rana architemporaria (Pliocene of Japan) †Rana basaltica (Miocene of China) †?Rana hipparionum (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of China, nomen dubium) †Rana pliocenica (Late Miocene of California) †Rana muelleri (Pleistocene of Germany) †Rana strausi (Late Pliocene of Germany) †?Rana yushensis (Early Pliocene of China, nomen nudum) The earliest known fossils of true Rana are of an indeterminate species from the Early Miocene of Germany. The paleosubspecies Rana temporaria fossilis was described in 1951 for articulated fossils from the late Eocene/early Oligocene of Bulgaria, but this taxonomic proposal was found to be invalid. Rana likely originated in Asia and migrated west to colonize Europe by the early Miocene, as was done earlier by Pelophylax.

was subsequently identified as the long-known R. okinavana. The latter name has been misapplied to the Ryūkyū brown frog, but the harpist brown frog is a rather distinct species that apparently belongs in Babina or Nidirana if these are considered valid.
