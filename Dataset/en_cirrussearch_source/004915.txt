UTC+07:00 is an identifier for a time offset from UTC of +07:00. In ISO 8601 the associated time would be written as 2024-03-25T21:48:10+07:00. It is 7 hours ahead of UTC, meaning that when the time in UTC areas is midnight (00:00), the time in UTC+07:00 areas would be 7:00 in the morning.

Australia Davis Station Since legal, political, and economic in addition to physical or geographical criteria are used in the drawing of time zones, it follows that official time zones do not precisely adhere to meridian lines. The UTC+07:00 time zone, were it drawn by purely geographical terms, would consist of exactly the area between meridians 97°30′ E and 112°30′ E. As a result, there are places which, despite lying in an area with a "physical" UTC+07:00 time, actually use another time zone. Conversely, there are areas that have adopted UTC+07:00, even though their "physical" time zone is UTC+08:00, UTC+06:00, or even UTC+05:00. This concerns areas within 97°30′ E to 112°30′ E longitude.

Formerly, from 1918 to 1949, this time offset was used in eastern Xikang and Qinghai, central Outer Mongolia (1921–1924), and all of Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Gansu, Sichuan, and Shaanxi. This time zone was also the standard used in Malaysia and Singapore from 1 June 1905 to 31 December 1932.
