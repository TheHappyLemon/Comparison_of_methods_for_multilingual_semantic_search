She's an absolute catch, and I thought, 'If I'm not going to feel the super sparks with her... it probably means I'm gay.'" Harris publicly came out as gay in November 2006, saying, "I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love."
