The International Bartenders Association (IBA), founded on 24 February 1951 in the saloon of the Grand Hotel in Torquay, England, is an international organisation established in order to represent the most skilled bartenders in the world. An annual event, both World Cocktail Competition (WCC) and World Flairtending Competition (WFC) were presented and organised by the IBA. The IBA also sanctions a list of official cocktails. Each year the events take place in different destinations. In 2006 from 6 October 2006 (for the 32nd annual WCC) to 7 October 2006 (for the 7th annual WFC) the competition was held in Meliton Porto Carras Hotel, Halkidiki, Greece.
