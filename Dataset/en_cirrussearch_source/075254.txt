John Nicholaas Rep (born 25 November 1951) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a right winger. He holds the all-time record for FIFA World Cup goals for the Netherlands with 7. Rep played as a right-footed striker in the Dutch World Cup teams of 1974 (West Germany) and 1978 (Argentina). He scored the winning goal for Ajax Amsterdam against Juventus in the 1973 European Cup Final in Belgrade and also helped SC Bastia reach the finals of the 1978 UEFA Cup. His pairing with Rob Rensenbrink was seen as an offensive powerhouse. He said that his time at Valencia was not good and that the only thing they helped him do was "learn Spanish". He claimed that SC Bastia suited him best. After his time in Bastia, Rep joined AS Saint-Étienne and was part of a side that included Michel Platini. He said he liked to distract himself by reading books by Harold Robbins and by playing cards.
