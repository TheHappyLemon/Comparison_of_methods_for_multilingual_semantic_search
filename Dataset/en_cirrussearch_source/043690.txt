Vlad Iulian Chiricheș (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈvlad ˈkirikeʃ]; born 14 November 1989) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays for Liga I club FCSB and the Romania national team. Primarily a centre-back, he can also be deployed as a right-back or a defensive midfielder. Chiricheș spent the first part of his senior career in Romania with Internațional Curtea de Argeș, Pandurii Târgu Jiu, and Steaua București. He helped the latter to a Liga I title and a Supercupa României, before transferring to Tottenham Hotspur in 2013 in a then Romanian record sale of €9.5 million (£8.5 million). Chiricheș relocated to Italy after two years in the Premier League, representing Serie A clubs Napoli, Sassuolo, and Cremonese over the course of eight seasons. In 2023, he returned to Romania by re-signing for FCSB. A full international for Romania since September 2011, Chiricheș has earned over 70 caps for his country and represented it in the UEFA Euro 2016. Chiricheș began his youth career in his hometown as a midfielder at LPS Bacău, and even played as a striker a few years later when he moved to Ardealul Cluj. At the latter side, he was teammates with also future Romanian internationals Mihai Răduț and Alexandru Maxim. In 2007, Chiricheș moved to Portuguese team Benfica. Upon his return to Romania after twelve months spent in Lisbon, Chiricheș joined lower league club Internațional Curtea de Argeș and helped them achieve promotion to the top flight in 2009. In 2010, shortly after Internațional was dissolved, he moved alongside many of his teammates to Pandurii Târgu Jiu. Chiricheș was close to sign for FCSB instead, but their coach Victor Pițurcă did not agree with the transfer. After one season in Târgu Jiu, Chiricheș eventually sealed a transfer to Steaua București for a reported sum of €700,000 plus 25% interest. FCSB paid €500,000 for the remaining procents of the co-ownership in August 2013, making the total transfer sum to €1.2 million. On 25 October 2012, he scored an overhead volley from near the penalty spot in a 2–0 win against Molde in the Europa League, which put Steaua in control of Group E. Chiricheș scored from long range against Ajax on 21 February 2013, canceling out a two-goal first-leg deficit as Steaua triumphed in the penalty shoot-out to set up a round of 16 meeting with 2012 Champions League winners Chelsea. He scored again away, an equalising goal to make it 1–1 with a fine close-range finish on the stroke of half-time in the 3–1 second leg loss against "the Blues" at Stamford Bridge after FCSB won the first leg 1–0. On 30 August 2013, English team Tottenham Hotspur paid €9.5 million (£8.5 million) for the signing of Chiricheș, making him the record transfer of the Romanian championship at the time. On 24 September, he made his competitive debut in a 4–0 League Cup victory over Aston Villa. He registered his Premier League debut against the same opponent, with fans voting him Man of the Match in the 2–0 away win on 20 October. On 4 December that year, Chiricheș scored his first goal by equalising from outside the penalty box in a 2–1 victory over Fulham. Towards the end of the 2015 winter transfer window, Italian side Roma offered €500,000 to take Chiricheș on a six-month loan, which was deemed too low and rejected by Tottenham. On 9 May 2015, he was sent off for two bookings as his team lost 0–3 to Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. On 30 July 2015, Italian club Napoli signed Chiricheș on a four-year deal for a £4.5 million transfer fee. He made his Serie A debut for the club in a 1–2 home loss to Sassuolo on 23 August.[citation needed] On 10 September 2018, Chiricheș suffered a damage to his anterior cruciate ligament which sidelined him for most of the season. On 2 September 2019, Chiricheș moved to fellow Serie A club Sassuolo on a one-season loan with an obligation to buy. In the summer of 2020, Sassuolo paid the previously-agreed €11 million fee to Napoli. On 8 July 2022, Chiricheș chose to stay in Italy and its Serie A by signing a one-year deal with Cremonese. FCSB announced the return of Chiricheș on 25 July 2023, roughly ten years after his record sale to Tottenham Hotspur. He made his debut four days later by starting in a 2–0 away league win over Oțelul Galați. Chiricheș only played a further six matches—of which three in the Europa Conference League qualifiers—before suffering a long-term injury which kept him out of action until March 2024. On 2 September 2011, Chiricheș made his senior debut for Romania in a 2–0 away victory over Luxembourg counting for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying. On 14 August 2013, he served as captain for the first time in a 1–1 friendly draw with Slovakia. His competitive debut as captain came on 6 September that year, in a 3–0 FIFA World Cup qualifier victory over Hungary. On 5 October 2017, Chiricheș reached his 50th cap for the national team in a 3–1 home defeat of Kazakhstan.
