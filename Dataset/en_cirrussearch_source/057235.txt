En (Н н; italics: Н н) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the dental nasal consonant /n/, like the pronunciation of ⟨n⟩ in "neat". The Cyrillic letter En was derived from the Greek letter Nu (Ν ν). The name of En in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was нашь (našĭ), meaning "ours". The capital Cyrillic letter En looks exactly the same as the capital Latin letter H but, as with most Cyrillic letters, the lowercase form is simply a smaller version of the uppercase. Rather than from the Greek letter Eta, from which Latin H originated, the Cyrillic letter En ⟨Н⟩ was derived from the Greek letter Nu. By exception, the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet used N and ɴ,[citation needed] instead of Н and н. The confusion between the two characters forms part of the plot of the Agatha Christie novel Murder on the Orient Express. It is possible that the reason En has a horizontal bar, like H, instead of a diagonal line, is to avoid confusion with the letter И, which looks similar to Nu.
