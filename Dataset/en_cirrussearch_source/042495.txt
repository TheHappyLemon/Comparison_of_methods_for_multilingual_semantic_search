His stage name Kygo can be pronounced as (Norwegian pronunciation: [kyːɡuː]) for Norwegian speakers and /ˈkaɪɡoʊ/ for English speakers. Both pronunciations can be used interchangeably. Kyrre got the idea for his stage name through a username he received in high school for the digital learning platform itslearning. The service used parts of his name to create a nickname, thereof "Ky-" standing for the first two letters in his given name "Kyrre" and "-go" for the first two letters in his surname "Gørvell-Dahll". The letter ø is usually replaced with letter o in computing. In an interview with newspaper Fanaposten, Kyrre quoted; "Kygo [as an artist name] has been absolutely perfect. It is very easy to say, in both Norwegian and English. [And] I have no need to change the artist name [in the future]". In June 2016 NRK said that Kygo is "giving 50 000 USD [...] of the profits [of his sold-out festival on 20 August]" to Frank Mugisha; Kygo was quoted: "Everyone should be permitted to live with one's sexual orientation. That is not the situation in Uganda and quite a few other countries across the world".
