This article lists the heads of state of the Comoros, since the country gained independence from France in 1975. A new constitution, approved in the 2018 constitutional referendum allows the president to run for two consecutive five-year terms. Previously during the time of Union of the Comoros, there was a one-term rotational system in place to share the presidency between Grande Comore, Anjouan and Mohéli. Article 58 of the Comorian Constitution states that "in case of absolute absence of a President" the following should happen: If the absence (death, resignation, etc.) should occur within the first 900 days of the term, the cabinet ministers and other members of the government select among the ministers a "main minister" to serve as Interim President. Elections must also be called in no more than 60 days after the absence of the President occurs; the person who wins those elections will be president for the remainder of the original five-year presidential term. If the absence should occur beyond the first 900 days of the term, then the Governor of the island currently holding the presidency will assume the presidency until the end of the original five-year presidential term, at which point regular elections are held.
