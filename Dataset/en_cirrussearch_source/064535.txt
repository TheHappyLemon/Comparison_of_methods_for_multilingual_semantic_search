The 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification will decide the teams that will join hosts Canada, Mexico and the United States at the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Qualification began on 7 September 2023 with three matches of the CONMEBOL zone played that day. The first goal of the qualification series was scored by Colombian player Rafael Santos Borré. On 30 March 2017, the Bureau of the FIFA Council (composed of the FIFA president and the presidents of each of the six confederations) proposed a slot allocation for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The recommendation was submitted for the ratification by the FIFA Council. On 9 May 2017, two days before the 67th FIFA Congress, the FIFA Council approved the slot allocation in a meeting in Manama, Bahrain. This includes an intercontinental play-off tournament involving six teams to decide the last two FIFA World Cup spots. The ratification of slot allocation also gives the OFC a guaranteed berth in the final tournament for the first time in FIFA World Cup history: the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the first tournament in which all six confederations have at least one guaranteed berth. Notes Including the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Although the United bid was selected on 13 June 2018, the automatic berths allocated to the hosts were not confirmed until a decision by the FIFA Council on 14 February 2023. On 9 May 2017, the FIFA Council approved the slot allocation scheme for the new 48-team final format. Eritrea withdrew before matches began. Each confederation is responsible for its own qualification tournament, which will consist of at least one round of competition using the following formats (Regulations Article 11.3): A league format in which each team in a group plays all other teams in their group twice – once at home and once away. A single round-robin format in which each team in a group plays all other teams in their group once, with the venues either drawn at random or assigned by the confederation with the agreement of the playing associations. A knockout format in which each team in a round plays one other team over two legs – once at home and once away. With FIFA's permission, a tournament held in one of the participating nations or in neutral territory. With FIFA's permission, a single-leg knockout format. In the two round-robin formats, the tiebreaker criteria are as follows (Regulations Article 11.5): Greatest number of points obtained in all group matches (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss) Greatest goal differential in all group matches Most goals scored in all group matches Should two or more teams still have equal rank after criteria 1–3 are applied, then the following criteria are used: Greatest number of points obtained in all matches amongst the concerned teams Greatest goal differential in all matches amongst the concerned teams Most goals scored in all matches amongst the concerned teams Most goals scored away from home in all matches amongst the concerned teams The best team conduct score using the following table: First yellow card: –1 point Second yellow card/indirect red card: –3 points Direct red card: –4 points Yellow card and direct red card: –5 points Only one score will be applied to any player or team official in any match, e.g. a player who receives a second yellow card will only have –3 points applied and not –4 (–1 for the first and –3 for the second). Drawing of lots by FIFA If the tournament is being held in a single host nation or in neutral territory, then criterion 7 will not be applied (Regulations Article 11.6). In the home-and-away knockout format, the team scoring more goals on aggregate wins the tie and advances. If the aggregate score is level, then 30 minutes of extra time will be played. If the score is still level at the end of extra time, the away goals rule will not be applied and the winners will be decided by a penalty shoot-out (Regulations Article 11.9). In the single-leg knockout format, the team scoring more goals in a single match wins and advances. If the teams are tied after regulation, then extra time will be played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score is still level (Regulations Article 11.10). On 1 August 2022, the Asian Football Confederation Executive Committee approved the qualification format for Asia's road to the 2026 World Cup, as well as the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, in preparation for the eight direct spots and the single intercontinental play-off slot allocated to the AFC by FIFA following the expansion of the FIFA World Cup to 48 teams. The draw for the first round was held on 27 July 2023 at 14:00 MST (UTC+8) at the AFC House in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The draw for the second round took place two hours later. The qualification structure is as follows: First round: Twenty teams (ranked 27–46) played home-and-away over two legs. The ten winners advanced to the second round. Second round: Thirty-six teams (those ranked 1–26 and the ten first-round winners) were divided into nine groups of four teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The eighteen group winners and group runners-up advance to the third round. Third round: The eighteen teams that advance from the second round will be divided into three groups of six teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The top two teams of each group will qualify for the World Cup, while the third-placed and fourth-placed teams of each group will advance to the fourth round. Fourth round: The six teams that advance from the third round will be divided into two groups of three teams each to play a single round-robin. The winners will qualify for the World Cup. Fifth round: The fourth round group runners-up will compete in a two-legged play-off tie to determine the Asian representation at the inter-confederation play-offs. Sri Lanka were suspended in January 2023 and they did not appear in the draw information the AFC released in early July. However, they were re-added with the condition that their federation hold elections at least ten days before qualification starts. The draw was held on 13 July 2023 at 15:00 GMT (UTC±0) in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. All 54 FIFA-affiliated football associations from CAF entered qualification, however Eritrea withdrew before matches began. The CAF Executive Committee announced a new African qualification format on 19 May 2023. The qualification structure is as follows: First round: Teams were drawn into nine groups of six teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The winner of each group will qualify for the World Cup. Second round: The four best-ranked group runners-up will participate in a play-off to determine which team will advance to the inter-confederation play-offs. Three nations in CONCACAF—Canada, Mexico and the United States—automatically qualified as host nations. On 28 February 2023, CONCACAF announced the qualifying format for 2026 World Cup qualification. First round: Four CONCACAF teams, ranked 29 to 32 based on the FIFA ranking of December 2023, were divided into two matchups to be played on a two-legged home-and-away basis. The two winners advanced to the second round. Second round: Thirty teams – the two winners from the first round and CONCACAF teams ranked 1 to 28 based on the FIFA ranking of December 2023 – were drawn into six groups of five teams. They will play single round-robin matches (two home and two away), with group winners and runners-up advancing to the third round. Third round: The twelve teams advancing from the second round will be drawn into three groups of four teams. They will play double round-robin home-and-away matches, with the three group winners qualifying for the World Cup. The two best-ranked runners-up will advance to the inter-confederation play-offs. On 22 August 2022, CONMEBOL petitioned FIFA to keep the qualification format which had been used since the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification, viz. all CONMEBOL members play home-and-away round-robin matches against each other. This was approved, with the first games of the qualifiers played in September 2023. Before the qualification competition began, Ecuador were deducted 3 points for falsifying birth documents for Byron Castillo in the previous World Cup qualification cycle. Updated to match(es) played on 21 November 2023. Source: FIFA 2026 marks the first time OFC will be granted one guaranteed slot in the World Cup, as well as a possible second slot via the inter-confederation play-offs. The qualification structure is as follows: First round: The four lowest-ranked teams will play a three-match knockout round in September 2024. The winner will advance to the second round. Second round: The winning team from the first round will join the seven highest-ranked teams in two four-team groups in October and November 2024. The top two teams from each group will advance to the third round. Third round: The four teams advancing from the second round will play a three-match knockout round in March 2025 with the winner qualifying for the World Cup and the runner-up going to the inter-confederation play-offs. The UEFA Executive Committee announced a new European qualification format on 25 January 2023. Teams will be drawn into twelve groups of four or five teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The group winners will qualify for the World Cup, while the runners-up will participate in play-off matches. Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia's national team is currently suspended and their participation is yet to be confirmed. First round (group stage): Twelve groups of either four or five teams with group winners qualifying for the World Cup finals. Play-off stage: 16 teams (twelve group runners-up and four best Nations League group winners, based on the Nations League overall ranking, that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group) will be drawn into four play-off paths, playing two rounds of single-match play-offs (semi-finals with the seeded teams to host, followed by finals, with the home teams to be drawn). The four path winners will qualify for the World Cup finals. A play-off tournament involving six teams will be held to decide the last two FIFA World Cup berths: these consist of one team per confederation, except for UEFA, and one additional team from the confederation of the host countries (CONCACAF). Two of the teams will be seeded based on the World Rankings, and these seeded teams will play for a FIFA World Cup berth against the winners of the first two knockout games involving the four unseeded teams. The four-game tournament is to be played in one or more of the host countries and to be used as a test event for the FIFA World Cup.
