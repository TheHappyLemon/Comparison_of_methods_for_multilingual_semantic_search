DeMarre LaEdrick Carroll (born July 27, 1986) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected as the 27th overall pick by the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2009 NBA draft. Carroll played in the NBA for 11 seasons with the Grizzlies, Houston Rockets, Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz, Atlanta Hawks, Toronto Raptors, Brooklyn Nets and San Antonio Spurs. He played college basketball for the Vanderbilt Commodores and Missouri Tigers. Carroll was born to parents Ed, a pharmacist and minister, and Cynthia Carroll. He was raised in Forestdale, Alabama. Carroll credits his inspiration to play basketball as his older brother DeLonte who died of a brain tumor at the age of nine. Carroll attended Minor High School in Adamsville until he transferred to John Carroll Catholic High School in Birmingham prior to the start of the 2002–03 season. He partnered with Alabama point guard Ronald Steele at John Carroll Catholic to lead the Cavaliers to back-to-back Alabama Class 6A state titles. He earned first team All-State, All-Area, All-Region, All-District and All-Metro recognition as a junior and senior and helped JCCHS to a combined 67–3 mark his final two seasons, culminating in those consecutive state crowns. He averaged 17.8 points and 9.1 rebounds as a junior for John Carroll's undefeated 36–0 state championship squad, before recording averages of 19.7 points and 10.7 rebounds as a senior en route to the team's 31–3 championship season. He capped his prep career by scoring a game-high 27 points in the annual Alabama-Mississippi All-Star Game and was named MVP of the 2004 Alabama Class 6A State Tournament. Considered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Carroll was listed as the No. 40 small forward and the No. 148 player in the nation in 2004. After a successful sophomore year at Vanderbilt, he surprised the team when he decided to transfer to Missouri in 2006 to play for his uncle Mike Anderson. Carroll helped lead Missouri to the Elite Eight (national quarterfinals) of the 2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament during his senior year. He was nicknamed the "Junkyard Dog" because of his toughness and relentless play. When Carroll came to Missouri, he complained of itchy legs, and was convinced that he was suffering from an allergy. After he was examined by several specialists, they came up with a considerably more serious diagnosis—liver disease. It was ultimately determined that Carroll would possibly need a liver transplant, but not for at least 20 years after his diagnosis and most likely after the end of any potential professional basketball career. His illness was revealed several weeks before the 2009 NBA draft. At 1:30 a.m. on July 5, 2007, Carroll was shot in the ankle during a domestic dispute at a nightclub in Columbia, Missouri. Carroll was drafted in the first round, 27th overall, by the Memphis Grizzlies. He played primarily off the bench during his tenure with the Memphis Grizzlies. On December 14, 2010, he was assigned to the Dakota Wizards of the NBA D-League. He was recalled on January 5, 2011. On February 24, 2011, Carroll was traded, along with Hasheem Thabeet and a future first-round draft pick, to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Shane Battier and Ish Smith. On April 11, 2011, he was waived by the Rockets. On December 12, 2011, the Denver Nuggets made Carroll a non-guaranteed training camp invitee. He appeared in four games with the Nuggets during the 2011–12 regular season before being waived on February 4, 2012. On February 8, 2012, Carroll signed with the Utah Jazz. On August 3, 2013, Carroll signed with the Atlanta Hawks. On February 22, 2014, he scored a then career-high 24 points in the 107–98 win over the New York Knicks. On December 23, 2014, Carroll scored a then career-high 25 points, while also grabbing a team-high 10 rebounds, in the 107–104 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. On February 4, 2015, he was part of the Hawks' starting line-up that were named the co-Kia Eastern Conference Players of the Month for January after the club compiled the first 17–0 record in a calendar month in league history. Five days later, he scored a career-high 26 points in the 117–105 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. On July 9, 2015, Carroll signed a four-year, $60 million contract with the Toronto Raptors. He made his debut for the Raptors in their season opener on October 28, 2015, recording 14 points and eight rebounds in a 106–99 win over the Indiana Pacers. On December 7, 2015, he was ruled out indefinitely with a bruised right knee. He returned to action on December 26 against the Milwaukee Bucks after missing nine straight games with the injury. He managed just five games before the same knee forced him to sit out the team's loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 4, 2016. Two days later, he underwent surgery on his right knee. On April 7, 2016, he returned to action against the Atlanta Hawks after missing 41 games. On January 8, 2017, Carroll tied a career high with 26 points and set a career high with six three-pointers on 10 attempts in a 129–122 loss to the Houston Rockets. On July 13, 2017, Carroll was traded, along with 2018 first and second round draft picks, to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Justin Hamilton. In his debut for the Nets in their season opener on October 18, 2017, Carroll scored 10 points in a 140–131 loss to the Indiana Pacers. On November 26, 2017, he scored a season-high 24 points in a 98–88 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. On July 6, 2019, Carroll was traded to the San Antonio Spurs in a three-team trade. After getting waived by the Spurs, Carroll was signed by the Houston Rockets on February 21, 2020. On August 2, 2022, Carroll was announced as an assistant coach for the Milwaukee Bucks. He joined the staff of head coach Mike Budenholzer who Carroll played under on the Atlanta Hawks. On July 4, 2023, Carroll was hired as an assistant coach by the Los Angeles Lakers. Carroll is the nephew of former Missouri and former Arkansas men's basketball coach Mike Anderson. His cousin, T.J. Cleveland, has worked as a college basketball assistant coach. 2004 High School 6A Finals MVP 2004 Alabama-Mississippi Game MVP 2007 Rivals.com Top Transfer 2009 First Team All-Big 12 2009 Academic All-Big 12 Team 2009 Big 12 men's basketball tournament MVP Birdsong, Nick (February 12, 2015).
