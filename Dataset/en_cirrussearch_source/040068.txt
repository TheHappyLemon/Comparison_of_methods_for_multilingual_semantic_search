Pafos FC (Greek: Πάφος FC) is a Cypriot football club based in Paphos. The club was created in 2014, by the merger of the two biggest teams of Paphos, AEP Paphos and AEK Kouklia. They play their home games at the Stelios Kyriakides Stadium and currently compete in the Cypriot First Division. The club is owned by the two Russians Sergey Lomakin and Roman Dubov. Lomakin is also the owner of the Russian second-tier club FC Rodina Moscow. Pafos FC was formed by a merger between the strongest football forces of the province of Paphos. The club's emblem includes the name of the club and town, and features the figure of Cypriot revolutionary Evagoras Pallikarides. The shape and colours of the emblem (white, blue, and gold) refer to the historical clubs of APOP and AEK Kouklia. The emblem was renewed in the 2018–19 season, making the figure of Pallikarides more visible. On 10 June 2014, the historic building of AEP Paphos FC hosted the first gathering for the supporters of the merged team, in the presence of politicians, active and veteran football players of Paphos, and hundreds of fans. The first president of the team was Christakis Kaizer, who was previously the president of AEK Kouklia and one of the main people in the effort to create the new team together with the then six-member managing committee of AEP. As an official home stadium for its obligations in the championship of the first division, the team uses Stelios Kyriakides Stadium (Paphiako Stadium). The purpose of the club is to promote noble rivalry, "fair play" and culture both through sports activities and through numerous cultural and educational events, and visits to schools, and educational institutions in Paphos. The team has projected a picture of renewal and full professionalism in all departments and levels. An important event is the complete renovation of the training center to the standards of European clubs. The team's first coach was Radmilo Ivančević, who had served as AEP Paphos's coach in the past. Pafos FC competed in the 2014–15 Cypriot Second Division, in their first season as a club. The first match in the club's history was against Enosis Neon Paralimni, at the Municipal Stadium of Geroskipou which was the first home stadium of the team. The team finished in second place and was promoted to the first division. In the 2015–16 season, in the first participation of Pafos FC in the first division, the team finished in 12th place and was relegated. Their first victory and the team's first overall victory in the first division came on 12 September 2015 in the third game of the league when Pafos FC defeated Aris Limassol 3–0 at home. The team finished 2nd in the Second Division and was promoted to the First Division in the 2016–17 season. The following season, Pafos FC remained in the top division, finishing in 10th place under the leadership of their new owner, Total Sports Investments, managed by British businessman Roman Dubov. Changes in the club's structure, the Academy's operational processes, renovation of the Pafos FC Training Center along with resounding transfers significantly raised the level of the club which now appears to be one of the most modern and well-equipped teams in Cyprus. Since Dubov's arrival, the team's placement in the league has improved (or remained constant) every year, from 2018 until now. On 25 February 2022, a 1–1 home draw against Aris Limassol allowed Pafos FC secure a place in the championship playoffs for the first time in the club's history. On this day, a new attendance record was set for Pafos FC, as over 4661 fans came to support the club. Pafos FC started the 2022–23 season strong under new head coach Henning Berg, going undefeated in their first 12 matches in the league. However, their form worsened over time, and Berg was sacked in April 2023. They were eliminated by Omonia in the semi-finals of the Cypriot Cup, and finished fourth in the league, missing out on European qualification in the last matchday. Pafos' forward Jairo was the joint top scorer of the league with 18 goals. On 24 June 2023, Juan Carlos Carcedo was announced as the new Head Coach of Pafos. The logo of Pafos FC is a variation of AEP Paphos's logo and a refresh of Pafos FC's first logo, including the name of the team and town and the classic figure of the Cypriot hero Evagoras Pallikaridis. The logo also includes the team's colours, blue, white, and gold. The emblem was renewed during the period 2018–19, making the depiction of the hero Evagoras Pallikarides more prominent.
