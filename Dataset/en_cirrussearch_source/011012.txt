Innsbruck (German: [ˈɪnsbʁʊk] ; Austro-Bavarian: Innschbruck [ˈɪnʃprʊk]) is the capital of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. On the River Inn, at its junction with the Wipp Valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass 30 km (19 mi) to the south, it had a population of 132,493 in 2018. In the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north and Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south, Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. It also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name means "bridge over the Inn". The earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia. The first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps. It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish. Innsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post. In 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tyrol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana). In 1669 the university was founded. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.[clarification needed] During the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province. The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church. During World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On 20 February 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army. In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.B In 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. During World War II, Innsbruck was the location of two subcamps of the Dachau concentration camp, including a special camp for prominent people from 16 countries and their families, who were held as hostages, including former Prime Minister of France Léon Blum, former regent of Hungary Miklós Horthy, former Chancellor of Austria Kurt Schuschnigg, Italian general Giuseppe Garibaldi II and a nephew of Winston Churchill. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage. In 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino. Innsbruck has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) using 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains. Winters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws. Spring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 °C (59 °F), but nights remain cool or even freezing. Summer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 °C (63 °F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 °C (93 °F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 °C (54 °F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 °C (43 °F). The average annual temperature is 9 °C (48 °F). Innsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages. These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (Statistischer Bezirk) and 178 numbered blocks (Zählsprengel). The following are the nine boroughs with the population as of 31 October 2011: Innsbruck (inner city) (18.524), consisting of Oldtown (Altstadt), Dreiheiligen-Schlachthof, and Saggen Wilten (15.772), consisting of Mentlberg, Sieglanger, and Wilten West Pradl (30.890), consisting of Pradler-Saggen, Reichenau, and Tivoli Hötting (31.246), consisting of Höttinger Au, Hötting West, Sadrach, Allerheiligen, Kranebitten, and part of Hungerburg Mühlau (4.750), consisting of part of Hungerburg Amras (5.403), consisting of Roßau Arzl (10.293), consisting of Neuarzl and Olympisches Dorf Vill (535) Igls (2.204) Nordkette Patscherkofel Old Inn Bridge (Alte Innbrücke) Ambras Castle Andreas Hofer's tomb St. Anne's Column (Annasäule) Bergisel Ski Jump Büchsenhausen Castle Canisianum Casino City Hall (Stadtsaal) Golden Roof (Goldenes Dachl) Helbling House (Helblinghaus) Imperial Palace (Hofburg) Hungerburgbahn Leopold Fountain (Leopoldsbrunnen) Maria-Theresien-Straße Maximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men (Schwarzen Männer) Old Federal State Parliament (Altes Landhaus) Old Town (Altstadt) Silver Chapel (Silberne Kapelle) City Tower (Stadtturm) Triumphal Arch (Triumphpforte) Tyrolean State Theatre Alpine Club Museum Ambras Castle Armoury City Archives Grassmayr Bell Foundry and Museum Innsbruck Stubaital station Kaiserjäger Museum Tyrol Panorama Museum (Das Tirol Panorama) Tyrolean Folk Art Museum (Tiroler Volkunstmuseum) Tyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum or Ferdinandeum) Tyrolean Museum Railways (Tiroler Museumsbahnen) Court Church (Hofkirche) Innsbruck Cathedral (Dom zu St. Jakob) Old Ursuline Church Jesuit Church Church of Our Lady Church of Our Lady of Perpectual Succour Servite Church Hospital Church Ursuline Church Wilten Abbey (Stift Wilten) Wilten Basilica (Wiltener Basilika) Holy Trinity Church St. John's Church St. Theresa's Church (Hungerburg) Pradler Parish Church St. Paul's State Memorial Church in the Reichenau Evangelical Church of Christ Evangelical Church of the Resurrection Old Höttingen Parish Church Höttingen Parish Church Parish Church of St. Nicholas Parish Church of Neu-Arzl Parish Church of St. Norbert Parish Church of Maria am Gestade Parish Church of the Good Shepherd Parish Church of St. George Parish Church of St. Paul Parish Church of St. Pirminius Church of the Guardian Angel Alpine Zoo (Alpenzoo) Baggersee Innsbruck Innsbruck University Botanic Garden Hofgarten (Court Garden) Rapoldi-Weiher Park Ambras Castle Park (Schlosspark Ambras) Ambras Castle Armoury City Tower (Stadtturm) Helblinghaus Innsbruck from the Inn river (looking towards Nordkette) Maximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men in the Court Church Old Town (Altstadt) with the Goldenes Dachl Siebenkreuzkapelle Tyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum) Wilten Basilica The results of the 2018 local elections were: Austrian Green Party 24.16% (left) Freedom Party of Austria 18.56% (right) Für Innsbruck 16.15% (conservative) Austrian People's Party 12.17% (conservative) Social Democratic Party of Austria 10.32% (left) NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum 4.73% (center) Bürgerforum Tirol – Liste Fritz (FRITZ) 3.23% Gerechtes Innsbruck (Gerecht) 3.10% Tiroler Seniorenbund – Für Alt und Jung (TSB) 2.72% Alternative Liste Innsbruck (ALI) 2.38% Innsbruck is a very popular tourist destination, organizing the following events every year: Innsbrucker Tanzsommer Bergsilvester (New Year's Eve) Innsbrucker Festwochen der Alten Musik (Innsbruck Festival of Early Music) Los Gurkos Short Film Festival Christkindlmarkt (Christmas fair) In 1971, author Douglas Adams was inspired to write the internationally successful The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series while lying intoxicated in a field in Innsbruck. From 2003 onwards each year Towel Day is celebrated worldwide on 25 May. Due to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for skiing in winter, ski-jumping and mountaineering in summer. There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months. The Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970. The 1976 Winter Olympics were the last games held in the German-speaking Alps (Austria, Germany, or Switzerland). Along with St. Moritz, Switzerland and Lake Placid, New York in the United States, it is one of three places which have twice hosted the Winter Games. It also hosted the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. Innsbruck hosted the 1st Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012.

The A12 and A13 converge near Innsbruck, at which point the A13 terminates. Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof, the most important railway station of Innsbruck and Tyrol, is one of the busiest railway stations in Austria. It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner Pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn. Innsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations. During the winter, activity increases significantly, due to the high number of skiers travelling to the region. The airport is approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the centre of Innsbruck. Local public transport is provided by Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe (IVB), a public authority operating a network of bus and tram routes. The metre-gauge tram network consists of four city lines, 1, 2, 3 and 5, and two lines serving the surrounding area: line 6, the Innsbrucker Mittelgebirgsbahn to Igls, and line STB, the Stubaitalbahn running through the Stubai Valley to Fulpmes. The network is planned to be enlarged during the coming years to reach the neighboring village Rum in the east and Völs in the west. Numerous bus lines serve the inner city and connect it with surrounding areas. Until 2007 the bus network included two trolleybus routes, but these were abandoned in preparation for planned expansion of the tram network. In December 2007, the Hungerburgbahn, a funicular service to the district of Hungerburg, was reopened after a two-year closure for extensive rebuilding, with partial realignment and a new extension across the Inn River and into central Innsbruck. The line was also equipped with new vehicles. Because of the unique design of the stations, drafted by the famous architect Zaha Hadid, the funicular evolves immediately to a new emblem of the city. The line was rebuilt by the Italian company Leitner, and can now carry up to 1,200 persons per hour. It is operated by a private company, the 'Innsbrucker Nordkettenbahnen'.
