Because 69 has an odd number of 1s in its binary representation, it is sometimes called an "odious number." In decimal, 69 is the only natural number whose square (4761) and cube (328509) use every digit from 0–9 exactly once. 69 is equal to 105 octal, while 105 is equal to 69 hexadecimal. This same property can be applied to all numbers from 64 to 69.
