Bohorodchany raion (Ukrainian: Богородча́нський райо́н, romanized: Bohorodčanśkyj rajon) was a district (raion) of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast in Ukraine. The urban-type settlement of Bohorodchany was the administrative center of the district. The raion was vaguely reminiscent with the Bohorodczan Powiat of the Stanisławów Voivodeship (1920 - 1932). The raion was abolished on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast Oblast to six. The area of Bohorodchany Raion was merged into Ivano-Frankivsk Raion. The last estimate of the raion population was 68,952 (2020 est.). The district was located in the south-western part of the Ivano-Frankivsk Region (also known as Prykarpattia) stretching from its center towards peaks of the Carpathian Mountains that serve as a natural border between Prykarpattia and Zakarpattia. To the west of the district was located the Rozhniativ district, to the north - Kalush, north-east - Tysmenytsia, south-east - Nadvirna. The Bohorodchany district also had a small border with the Zakarpattia Region. The physical geography of the district was not the same and was divided into three landscape zones: plains, piedmont (foothills), mountains. The highest peak was the mountain Syvulia 1,836.6 m (6,026 ft) which was located on the border of Bohorodchany and Rozhniativ districts and is part of Gorgany mountainous system. Two major rivers that flow through the area are Bystrytsias of Solotvyn and Nadvirna. The total area of forests in the district was 413 km2 (159 sq mi) which was over 50% of the district's territory. In the middle of the Carpathian Gorgany was located a botanic reserve "Skete of Manyava" known as a local arboretum which contains selection of Larix decidua. Near the reserve is located over 20 m (66 ft) tall waterfall, a local Landmark of Nature. Near the village of Starunya is located a unique mud volcano. At the time of disestablishment, the raion consisted of four hromadas: Bohorodchany settlement hromada with the administration in Bohorodchany; Dzvyniach rural hromada with the administration in the selo of Dzvyniach; Solotvyn settlement hromada with the administration in the urban-type settlement of Solotvyn; Stari Bohorodchany rural hromada with the administration in the selo of Stari Bohorodchany. The raion was divided into 32 municipalities: two - urban, 30 - rural. Within the district were located 41 settlements and no cities. All municipalities are named after their administrative centers and may include other settlements within their territories. The government in the district was headed by the chairman of the district state administration (governor) appointed by the President of Ukraine. The governor appointed his deputies forming his regional governing cabinet to supervise the government policies in the region. Aside of the state administration the region had its own council that is headed by its chairman. The composition of the council depends on the popular vote in the region, while the chairman is elected within the elected council. Regional State Administration The District State Administration (BRDA) consisted of the chairman, his deputies (3), and secretary who headed the supporting "aparat" of the administration. Within the administration were numerous departments, each of them headed by a chief of department. The Bohorodchany District State Administration had 13 departments and other government institutions such as the Children Service, regional state archives, and others.
