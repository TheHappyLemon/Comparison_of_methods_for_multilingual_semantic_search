ONE Pro Cycling (UCI team code: ONE) was a British UCI Continental men's cycling team. Their first season was 2015, and they became a Professional Continental team in 2016. Due to funding issues, they reverted to Continental level in 2017. ONE Pro Cycling was owned by retired professional cricketer Matt Prior and businessman Simon Chappell. The team officially launched on 17 February 2015, although started racing the week prior, at the opening race of the UK domestic road race season Prior stated that the team's aim was to join the UCI World Tour within five years. In November 2015 it was confirmed that the team had been granted a UCI Professional Continental licence for the 2016 season. They returned to UCI Continental level for the 2017 season, in part because bike sponsor Factor withdrew their support from the team in favour of supplying bicycles to AG2R La Mondiale. In September 2018 the team announced that they would disband their men's squad at the end of the season in favour of entering the women's peloton the following year. One month later in October 2018 the team announced that they had scrapped plans to launch a women's team for the 2019 season, citing lack of sufficient sponsorship. 2015 Perf's Pedal Race, Yanto Barker Clayton Spring Classic, Peter Williams Primavera Road Race, Marcin Białobłocki Severn Bridge Road Race, George Harper Eddie Soens Memorial Road Race, Peter Williams Betty Pharoah Memorial Road Race, Marcin Białobłocki Stage 1 Bałtyk–Karkonosze Tour, Peter Williams  Poland National Time Trial Championships, Marcin Białobłocki 2016  New Zealand National Time Trial Championships, Hayden McCormick Stage 3 New Zealand Cycle Classic, Kristian House The REV Classic, Dion Smith Tro-Bro Léon, Martin Mortensen Stage 1 Tour of Norway, Steele Von Hoff Stage 2 Tour de Korea, Chris Opie Stages 3 & 5 Tour de Korea, Karol Domagalski Stage 7 Tour de Korea, Kristian House Beaumont Trophy, Dion Smith Stage 1 Sibiu Cycling Tour, Steele Von Hoff 2017 Stage 5 Szlakiem Walk Majora Hubala, Tom Stewart Beaumont Trophy, Peter Williams Stage 2 Kreiz Breizh Elites, James Oram Grand Prix des Marbriers, Karol Domagalski Overall Ronde van Midden-Nederland, Kamil Gradek Stage 1, Team time trial 2018 Overall New Zealand Cycle Classic, Hayden McCormick Poreč Trophy, Emīls Liepiņš Stage 3 Istrian Spring Trophy, Emīls Liepiņš Heistse Pijl, Emīls Liepiņš 2015 Poland National Time Trial, Marcin Bialoblocki 2016 New Zealand National Time Trial, Hayden Mccormick Renton, Colin (27 August 2015).
