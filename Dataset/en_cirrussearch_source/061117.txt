Luis Fernando Díaz Marulanda (born 13 January 1997) is a Colombian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club Liverpool and the Colombia national team. Díaz began his professional career in the Categoría Primera B at Barranquilla, before moving to Atlético Junior, winning Categoría Primera A, one Copa Colombia and one Superliga Colombiana. In 2019, he joined Porto for a reported fee of €7 million, winning two Primeira Liga titles, one Taça de Portugal, and one Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. After 14 league goals in 18 league games in the first half of 2021–22, Liverpool signed him in a transfer worth €45 million (£37.5 million). He won the EFL Cup and FA Cup in his first season, and was man of the match in the latter final. Díaz made his senior international debut for Colombia in 2018. He has earned over 30 caps for his national team, helping them to a third-place finish at the 2021 Copa América, and being awarded the Golden Boot. Luis Fernando Díaz Marulanda was born on 13 January 1997 in Barrancas, La Guajira, and began playing football at the age of six. Nicknamed "Luchito", he attended a small football school run by his father. In 2014, at the age of 17, he attended an open trial hosted by Atlético Junior and impressed enough to join the youth team. He was included in Colombia's 22-man squad for the 2015 Copa Americana de Pueblos Indígenas, due to his Wayuu ethnicity. After impressing during the tournament, he joined the senior team of Atlético Junior in 2016, being immediately assigned to farm team Barranquilla. Given Díaz's slender build and a potentially malnourished appearance, he was given a dietary plan by Barranquilla to gain 10 kg. Díaz made his senior debut on 26 April 2016, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–1 Categoría Primera B home loss against Deportivo Pereira. His first senior goal came on 14 May, as he scored the winner in a 2–1 home defeat of Cúcuta Deportivo. On 6 June 2017, after already making his first team debut in the year's Copa Colombia, Díaz was subsequently promoted to Junior's main squad. He made his Categoría Primera A debut on 27 August, replacing Matías Mier in a 3–2 loss at Once Caldas, and scored his first goal on 20 September in a 3–1 Copa Sudamericana home win against Cerro Porteño. Díaz became a regular starter during the 2018 season, and scored his first goal in the top tier on 4 February of that year, by netting the game's only in a home success over Atlético Bucaramanga. He also added braces against Once Caldas, Atlético Huila and Rionegro Águilas, ending the campaign with 16 goals overall.[citation needed] On 10 July 2019, Díaz signed for Portuguese club FC Porto on a five-year contract, with the club buying 80% of his economic rights for a fee of €7 million. Zenit Saint Petersburg had also wanted to sign him, but he was convinced otherwise by compatriot former Porto players Radamel Falcao and James Rodríguez, as well as his then national team coach Carlos Queiroz. Díaz also admitted that prior to his Porto move, he had signed a pre-contract with Cardiff City, but the move never materialised. Díaz made his debut on 7 August in a 1–0 win at Krasnodar in the UEFA Champions League first qualifying round first leg as a 55th-minute substitute for Romário Baró, and six days later in the return game he scored his first goal, albeit in a 3–2 loss at the Estádio do Dragão. Domestically, he made his Primeira Liga debut on 10 August in a 2–1 loss at Gil Vicente as a substitute, and a week later scored for the first to wrap up a 4–0 home win against Vitória de Guimarães as a starter. In November, he, Mateus Uribe, Agustín Marchesín and Renzo Saravia were suspended from the derby against Boavista for having partied the night before. In his first season in Portugal, Díaz totalled 50 appearances and 14 goals as Porto won the league and the Taça de Portugal. In the final of the latter on 1 August 2020, he was sent off after 38 minutes in a 2–1 win over Benfica at the Estádio Cidade de Coimbra. On 21 October 2020, he scored his first Champions League goal in a 3–1 defeat against Manchester City in the 2020–21 season. On 23 December, Díaz came on as a 77th-minute substitute for Mehdi Taremi in the 2020 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira against O Clássico rivals Benfica, and scored to confirm a 2–0 win. The following 10 February, he was sent off in a 1–1 draw at Braga in a cup semi-final for unintentionally breaking David Carmo's leg; compatriot Uribe was also dismissed. On 11 September 2021, Díaz scored in a 1–1 away draw against rivals Sporting CP. On 9 October, he scored the only goal of a 1–0 Champions League group stage win over AC Milan. With two goals in a 4–0 win over Moreirense on 1 November, he reached five goals in his first six league games, best in the league; On 28 November, he scored his tenth, a long-range effort in the 2–1 victory over Vitória de Guimarães; this goal earned him the Primeira Liga Goal of the Month award. His performances led to him being also named the league's Player of the Month and Forward of the Month for October and November. On 19 December, Díaz was named the league's Forward of the Month for the second consecutive month, after scoring four goals and providing three assists. Despite leaving Porto halfway through his final season, he was the joint seventh top scorer with 14 goals. Despite leaving Porto in January 2022, he was issued with a winner's medal after the club won the 2021–22 Primeira Liga title. On 30 January 2022, Díaz signed a five-year contract at Premier League club Liverpool for a reported €45 million (£37.5 million) with €15 million (£12.5 million) add-ons. Prior to signing for Liverpool, Díaz had attracted interest from Tottenham Hotspur. Upon learning of Tottenham's bid, Liverpool changed their summer plans, and decided to sign Díaz on a permanent deal, after impressing Liverpool's manager Jürgen Klopp. He made his debut on 6 February, coming on as a 58th-minute substitute for Curtis Jones in an FA Cup fourth-round game at home to Cardiff City. He assisted a goal by Takumi Minamino in a 3–1 win. Thirteen days later, he scored his first goal for Liverpool in his second league start for the club in a 3–1 home win over Norwich City at Anfield. In the 2022 EFL Cup final on 27 February, he played the first 97 minutes of a goalless draw with Chelsea that his team won on penalties. On 5 April, in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-finals, Díaz scored a goal and provided an assist in a 3–1 away win against Benfica, as Liverpool won 6–4 on aggregate. On 19 April, Díaz scored within five minutes of a 4–0 victory against Manchester United. On 3 May, he scored the second goal in Liverpool's 3–2 away victory over Villarreal in the Champions League semi-final, to secure his team's place in the final. On 7 May, Díaz scored the equaliser in a 1–1 draw to Tottenham Hotspur. On 14 May, he started in the 2022 FA Cup final against Chelsea, which Liverpool won 6–5 on penalties after a goalless draw, with Diaz being replaced by Roberto Firmino in the 98th minute, as he was named man of the match. On 28 May, Diaz started in the 2022 Champions League final as Liverpool lost 1–0 to Real Madrid. On 30 July 2022, Díaz started for Liverpool in the club's 3–1 win over Manchester City in the FA Community Shield at the King Power Stadium. Diaz started the new months of the season by scoring four goals and providing three assists, including a brace in Liverpool's 9–0 win over AFC Bournemouth, which equalled the joint-largest win in the history of the Premier League. However, on 9 October, Díaz came off for Roberto Firmino in the 42nd minute of a game against Arsenal due to an knee injury. After seven months in the sidelines, Díaz made his return from injury on 17 April, replacing Cody Gakpo in the 81st minute of a 6–1 away win over Leeds United. Having not registered a goal since 7 September 2022, Díaz returned to scoring ways on 30 April 2023, scoring Liverpool's second goal in their late 4–3 home win over Tottenham Hotspur, despite Liverpool leading the match by three goals at half time. Diaz entered the 2023–24 season with a new shirt number, changing from 23 to 7. On 13 August, Díaz scored his first goal of the season as his side drew 1–1 against Chelsea in the Premier League. On 19 August, he scored an acrobatic volley in a 3–1 win against Bournemouth. On 30 September, Díaz scored against Tottenham Hotspur in a Premier League away match, with the goal being disallowed by the linesman for being offside. VAR did not intervene on the decision after an "unusually quick" review. After the match, PGMOL admitted that the offside ruling was a "significant human error" and Díaz should have been awarded a goal. Liverpool lost the game 2–1. On 5 November, in the first match he played since the kidnapping of his parents, Díaz came on as a substitute and scored a late stoppage-time equaliser in a 1–1 Premier League draw away against Luton Town. After representing Colombia at under-20 level in the 2017 South American U-20 Championship, Díaz was called up to the full squad on 27 August 2018, for friendlies against Venezuela and Argentina. He made his full international debut on 11 September, replacing Juan Cuadrado in a 0–0 draw against the latter at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Díaz scored his first international goal on 26 March 2019, equalising in a 2–1 friendly loss away to South Korea. He was part of Carlos Queiroz' 23-man squad for the 2019 Copa América in Brazil. Díaz was included in Colombia's squad for the 2021 Copa América. On 23 June, he scored the opening goal in a 2–1 first round loss to hosts Brazil with a bicycle kick, and on 6 July he scored their goal in a semi-final draw against Argentina, which ended in an Argentine victory following a penalty shoot-out. Three days later, he scored twice, including the match-winning goal, in a 3–2 victory over Peru in the third-place match. He ended as joint top goalscorer of the tournament alongside Lionel Messi. On 16 November 2023, Díaz scored both goals as Colombia beat Brazil for the first time in a FIFA World Cup qualifier. Díaz is of Wayuu origin, making him the first indigenous Colombian to represent Colombia. His brother, Jesús, is also a professional footballer. In July 2023, Díaz got engaged to his girlfriend, Gera Ponce. On 29 October 2023, Díaz's mother Cilenis Marulanda and father Luis Manuel "Mane" Diaz were kidnapped by armed men on motorcycles at a gas station in their hometown of Barrancas. His mother was rescued by police a day later, with a "major military search" announced to locate his father. Colombian President Gustavo Petro stated that "all the public forces have been deployed" and the following day, General William Rene Salamanca announced a reward of up to 200 million pesos for information on Díaz's father's whereabouts. Díaz was absent for Liverpool's following Premier League match against Nottingham Forest, with his teammate Diogo Jota holding up Díaz's shirt during a goal celebration. His father was released by the kidnappers on 9 November.
