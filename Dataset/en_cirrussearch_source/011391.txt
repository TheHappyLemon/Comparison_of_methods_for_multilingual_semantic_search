A landaulet, also known as a landaulette, is a car body style where the rear passengers are covered by a convertible top. Often the driver is separated from the rear passengers by a division, as with a limousine. During the first half of the 20th century, taxicabs were often landaulets, with models such as the Austin 12/4 and the Checker Model G and early Checker Model A being a common sight in larger cities. Around the middle of the 20th century landaulets were built for public figures such as heads of state to use for formal processions or parades when they wished to be more visible to large crowds. Open cars are now less frequently used, due to security concerns. The car body style is derived from the horse-drawn carriage of similar style that was a cut-down (coupé) version of a landau. In British English, the term landaulet is used specifically for horse-drawn carriages, and landaulette is used when referring to motor vehicles. Like many other car body styles landaulets continued from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles. The condition of the driver's section may range from having no weather protection at all, as was often the case with early landaulets,[dubious – discuss] to being fully enclosed. 1904 Panhard et Levassor 8 hp 1910 Croxton-Keeton taxi cab 1915 Brewster & Co. town landaulet 1929 Steyr 19 Type XX 1930 Cadillac V16 1937 Duesenberg Model J by Bohmann & Schwartz New landaulet cars became rare in the 1930s After WWII landaulets were unfashionable and built only as parade cars for heads of state.
