He also works in body painting, exhibiting his works in nightclubs. He created three stamps in optical art for Swiss Post, in 2010., Between 1958 and 1962 Youri Messen-Jaschin studied Fine art at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts (student of Robert Cami) and History of art at the École pratique des hautes études (student of Pierre Francastel), both in Paris. Between 1962 and 1965, he attended the École cantonale d'art de Lausanne. He worked with engraver and painter Ernest Pizzotti. He exposed his kinetic glass and acrylic sculptures in Lausanne in 1964. He worked two years at the Center of Contemporary Engraving in Geneva and then in Zürich, where he collaborated with the painter Friederich Kuhn. Between 1968 and 1970, he studied at the School of Design and Crafts in Göteborg, where he researched textile kinetic objects. There, through his discussions with artists Jesús Rafael Soto, Carlos Cruz-Diez and Julio Le Parc, he became increasingly interested in by Op art and decided to devote all his research to Kinetic art. He started to increasingly integrate movement and geometric shapes in his textiles and oil paintings. In 1968, he received the first prize for Swiss contemporary engraving art as well as a scholarship from the Swedish government. In 1970, he worked in Hamburg, collaborating with North German artists on monumental projects, and created a kinetic sculpture for Gould in Eichstetten, Germany. Youri Messen-Jaschin traveled in South America, where he was able to discuss architecture – which plays an important role in his work – and its relations to his own research on movement with architects and artists like Oscar Niemeyer and Roberto Burle Marx in Rio de Janeiro, Ruy Ohtake in São Paulo, and Clorindo Testa in Buenos Aires. In 1984 in Caracas, he staged theatre and choreography of his own works at the Ateneo, the Eugenio Mendoza Foundation, the Asociación Cultural Humboldt (Goethe-Institut), and at the Alliance française. After a stay of several months in New York, he returned to Switzerland in 1971, where he took up residence in Bern, where he lived for eleven years. During his stay, he frequently exhibited at the Kunsthalle and other local museums. He currently lives in Lausanne, Switzerland. He participated in many international exhibitions. His works are in private collections, in national and international museums. 2013 Youri Messen-Jaschin: Op Art, Galerie du Château, Renens, Switzerland 2018 POPA Museum | Exhibition Youri Messen-Jaschin Op Art | April 20-May 21 | Porrentruy, Switzerland 2019 Youri Messen-Jaschin | Galerie du Château, Renens, Switzerland | March 15-April 7, 2019 2000 Premio Internazionale di scultura "Terzo millenio" Terra Moretti Editor Fiorenza Mursia/Milan/Italy 2016 Guide Contemporain, volume III, p. 138 | Published by the Fondation Lémanique pour l'Art Contemporain 2022 Youri Messen-Jaschin, an artist who plays with your brain, Swiss Review, The magazine for the Swiss Abroad, p. 10-11.
