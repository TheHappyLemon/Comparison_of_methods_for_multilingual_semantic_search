In algebra and number theory, Wilson's theorem states that a natural number n > 1 is a prime number if and only if the product of all the positive integers less than n is one less than a multiple of n. That is (using the notations of modular arithmetic), the factorial (n−1)!=1×2×3×⋯×(n−1){\displaystyle (n-1)!=1\times 2\times 3\times \cdots \times (n-1)} satisfies (n−1)! ≡−1(modn){\displaystyle (n-1)!\ \equiv \;-1{\pmod {n}}} exactly when n is a prime number. In other words, any integer n > 1 is a prime number if, and only if, (n − 1)! + 1 is divisible by n. This theorem was stated by Ibn al-Haytham (c. 1000 AD), and, in the 18th century, by the English mathematician John Wilson. Edward Waring announced the theorem in 1770, although neither he nor his student Wilson could prove it. Lagrange gave the first proof in 1771. There is evidence that Leibniz was also aware of the result a century earlier, but he never published it. For each of the values of n from 2 to 30, the following table shows the number (n − 1)! and the remainder when (n − 1)! is divided by n. (In the notation of modular arithmetic, the remainder when m is divided by n is written m mod n.) The background color is blue for prime values of n, gold for composite values. The proofs (for prime moduli) below use the fact that the residue classes modulo a prime number are a finite field—see the article Prime field for more details. Lagrange's theorem, which states that in any field a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots, is needed for all the proofs. If n is composite it is divisible by some prime number q, where 2 ≤ q ≤ n − 2. Because q{\displaystyle q} divides n{\displaystyle n}, let n=qk{\displaystyle n=qk} for some integer k{\displaystyle k}. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that (n−1)!{\displaystyle (n-1)!} were congruent to −1 (mod n) where n is composite. Then (n-1)! would also be congruent to −1 (mod q) as (n−1)!≡−1 (mod n){\displaystyle (n-1)!\equiv -1\ ({\text{mod}}\ n)} implies that (n−1)!=nm−1=(qk)m−1=q(km)−1{\displaystyle (n-1)!=nm-1=(qk)m-1=q(km)-1} for some integer m{\displaystyle m} which shows (n-1)! being congruent to -1 (mod q). But (n − 1)! ≡ 0 (mod q) by the fact that q is a term in (n-1)! making (n-1)! a multiple of q. A contradiction is now reached. In fact, more is true. With the sole exception of 4, where 3! = 6 ≡ 2 (mod 4), if n is composite then (n − 1)! is congruent to 0 (mod n). The proof is divided into two cases: First, if n can be factored as the product of two unequal numbers, n = ab, where 2 ≤ a < b ≤ n − 2, then both a and b will appear in the product 1 × 2 × ... × (n − 1) = (n − 1)! and (n − 1)! will be divisible by n. If n has no such factorization, then it must be the square of some prime q, q > 2. But then 2q < q2 = n, both q and 2q will be factors of (n − 1)!, and again n divides (n − 1)!. The result is trivial when p = 2, so assume p is an odd prime, p ≥ 3. Since the residue classes (mod p) are a field, every non-zero a has a unique multiplicative inverse, a−1. Lagrange's theorem implies that the only values of a for which a ≡ a−1 (mod p) are a ≡ ±1 (mod p) (because the congruence a2 ≡ 1 can have at most two roots (mod p)). Therefore, with the exception of ±1, the factors of (p − 1)! can be arranged in disjoint pairs such that product of each pair is congruent to 1 modulo p. This proves Wilson's theorem. For example, for p = 11, one has 10!=[(1⋅10)]⋅[(2⋅6)(3⋅4)(5⋅9)(7⋅8)]≡[−1]⋅[1⋅1⋅1⋅1]≡−1(mod11).{\displaystyle 10!=[(1\cdot 10)]\cdot [(2\cdot 6)(3\cdot 4)(5\cdot 9)(7\cdot 8)]\equiv [-1]\cdot [1\cdot 1\cdot 1\cdot 1]\equiv -1{\pmod {11}}.} Again, the result is trivial for p = 2, so suppose p is an odd prime, p ≥ 3. Consider the polynomial g(x)=(x−1)(x−2)⋯(x−(p−1)).{\displaystyle g(x)=(x-1)(x-2)\cdots (x-(p-1)).} g has degree p − 1, leading term xp − 1, and constant term (p − 1)!. Its p − 1 roots are 1, 2, ..., p − 1. Now consider h(x)=xp−1−1.{\displaystyle h(x)=x^{p-1}-1.} h also has degree p − 1 and leading term xp − 1. Modulo p, Fermat's little theorem says it also has the same p − 1 roots, 1, 2, ..., p − 1. Finally, consider f(x)=g(x)−h(x).{\displaystyle f(x)=g(x)-h(x).} f has degree at most p − 2 (since the leading terms cancel), and modulo p also has the p − 1 roots 1, 2, ..., p − 1. But Lagrange's theorem says it cannot have more than p − 2 roots. Therefore, f must be identically zero (mod p), so its constant term is (p − 1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p). This is Wilson's theorem. It is possible to deduce Wilson's theorem from a particular application of the Sylow theorems. Let p be a prime. It is immediate to deduce that the symmetric group Sp{\displaystyle S_{p}} has exactly (p−1)!{\displaystyle (p-1)!} elements of order p, namely the p-cycles Cp{\displaystyle C_{p}}. On the other hand, each Sylow p-subgroup in Sp{\displaystyle S_{p}} is a copy of Cp{\displaystyle C_{p}}. Hence it follows that the number of Sylow p-subgroups is np=(p−2)!{\displaystyle n_{p}=(p-2)!}. The third Sylow theorem implies (p−2)!≡1(modp).{\displaystyle (p-2)!\equiv 1{\pmod {p}}.} Multiplying both sides by (p − 1) gives (p−1)!≡p−1≡−1(modp),{\displaystyle (p-1)!\equiv p-1\equiv -1{\pmod {p}},} that is, the result. In practice, Wilson's theorem is useless as a primality test because computing (n − 1)! modulo n for large n is computationally complex, and much faster primality tests are known (indeed, even trial division is considerably more efficient).[citation needed] Used in the other direction, to determine the primality of the successors of large factorials, it is indeed a very fast and effective method. This is of limited utility, however.[citation needed] Using Wilson's Theorem, for any odd prime p = 2m + 1, we can rearrange the left hand side of 1⋅2⋯(p−1) ≡ −1 (modp){\displaystyle 1\cdot 2\cdots (p-1)\ \equiv \ -1\ {\pmod {p}}} to obtain the equality 1⋅(p−1)⋅2⋅(p−2)⋯m⋅(p−m) ≡ 1⋅(−1)⋅2⋅(−2)⋯m⋅(−m) ≡ −1(modp).{\displaystyle 1\cdot (p-1)\cdot 2\cdot (p-2)\cdots m\cdot (p-m)\ \equiv \ 1\cdot (-1)\cdot 2\cdot (-2)\cdots m\cdot (-m)\ \equiv \ -1{\pmod {p}}.} This becomes ∏j=1m j2 ≡(−1)m+1(modp){\displaystyle \prod _{j=1}^{m}\ j^{2}\ \equiv (-1)^{m+1}{\pmod {p}}} or (m!)2≡(−1)m+1(modp).{\displaystyle (m!)^{2}\equiv (-1)^{m+1}{\pmod {p}}.} We can use this fact to prove part of a famous result: for any prime p such that p ≡ 1 (mod 4), the number (−1) is a square (quadratic residue) mod p. For this, suppose p = 4k + 1 for some integer k. Then we can take m = 2k above, and we conclude that (m!)2 is congruent to (−1) (mod p). Wilson's theorem has been used to construct formulas for primes, but they are too slow to have practical value. Wilson's theorem allows one to define the p-adic gamma function. Gauss proved[non-primary source needed] that ∏k=1gcd(k,m)=1mk ≡{−1(modm)if m=4,pα,2pα1(modm)otherwise{\displaystyle \prod _{k=1 \atop \gcd(k,m)=1}^{m}\!\!k\ \equiv {\begin{cases}-1{\pmod {m}}&{\text{if }}m=4,\;p^{\alpha },\;2p^{\alpha }\\\;\;\,1{\pmod {m}}&{\text{otherwise}}\end{cases}}} where p represents an odd prime and α{\displaystyle \alpha } a positive integer. That is, the product of the positive integers less than m and relatively prime to m is one less than a multiple of m when m is equal to 4, or a power of an odd prime, or twice a power of an odd prime; otherwise, the product is one more than a multiple of m. The values of m for which the product is −1 are precisely the ones where there is a primitive root modulo m. Wilson prime Table of congruences The Universal Book of Mathematics.

Si datus sit derivativus relinquet numerum qui cum dato habeat communem mensuram unitate majorem." Egli non giunse pero a dimostrarlo. Translation : In addition, he [Leibniz] also glimpsed Wilson's theorem, as shown in the following statement: "The product of all integers preceding the given integer, when divided by the given integer, leaves 1 (or the complement of 1?) if the given integer be prime. If the given integer be composite, it leaves a number which has a common factor with the given integer [which is] greater than one." However, he didn't succeed in proving it.
