He was killed in the 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash, in which almost all players and coaches from the club perished. On 7 September 2011, Kalimulin was killed when a Yakovlev Yak-42 passenger aircraft, carrying nearly his entire Lokomotiv team, crashed just outside Yaroslavl, Russia. The team was traveling to Minsk to play their opening game of the season, with its coaching staff and prospects. Lokomotiv officials said "'everyone from the main roster was on the plane plus four players from the youth team.'"
