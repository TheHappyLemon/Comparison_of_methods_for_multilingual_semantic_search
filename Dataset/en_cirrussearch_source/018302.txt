Łebsko Lake is a brackish coastal lake in the Pomeranian Voivodeship of Poland. It is connected to the Baltic Sea by the Łeba River, which causes saltwater intrusion. It is located within Słowiński National Park. The lake formed when sea winds pushed up a spit of sand that ultimately separated it from the Baltic sea. The town of Łeba sits where the Łeba river meets the sea. Mrozińska, Natalia; Bąkowska, Martyna (2020-09-19).
