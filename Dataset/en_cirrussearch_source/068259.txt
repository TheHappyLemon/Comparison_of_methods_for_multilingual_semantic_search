Fridolina Rolfö (born 24 November 1993) is a Swedish professional footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish Liga F club FC Barcelona and the Sweden national team. Fridolina Rolfö was born on 24 November 1993 to mother Eleonore Andersson and father Lars Rolfö. She has a younger brother named Julius and an older sister named Daniella, the latter of whom played football and inspired Rolfö to do the same. She grew up in Kungsbacka, a municipality within Metropolitan Gothenberg. In her youth, Rolfö played both football and handball, but chose to focus solely on football when she turned fifteen. The first football team she played for at age 10 was the girls youth section of IFK Fjärås, located in the south of Kungsbacka in the town of Fjärås. After joining from Tölö, Rolfö scored nine league goals for Jitex in her debut Damallsvenskan season, 2011. Her favoured position was on the right wing, so she could cut inside and shoot with her strong left foot. She scored her first three league goals on May 5, 2011 in a 9-0 away win against newly promoted Dalsjöfors GoIF with a hat trick to make it 1-0, 2-0 and 3-0. She was named the 2011 Women's Junior Player of the Year by Göteborgs-Posten, Rolfö signed for Linköping in 2014 and scored a hat-trick on her UEFA Champions League debut against English champions Liverpool. In November 2016, it was announced that Rolfö would sign for current Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. She signed an 18-month contract, starting from 1 January 2017. On February 26, 2017 she made her debut in the 2-1 win in the home game against FF USV Jena, coming on as a substitute for Melanie Leupolz in the 68th minute. She scored her first Bundesliga goal on October 1, 2017 in a 4-0 away win against TSG 1899 Hoffenheim. In each of her three seasons in Germany, Bayern Munich finished runners up to VfL Wolfsburg in the league.[circular reference] In May 2019, current Bundesliga champions VfL Wolfsburg announced the signing of Rolfö to a two-year contract. On 25 August 2020, Rolfö scored the only goal against Barcelona in their single-legged Champions League semifinal victory to book a place in the final, where her team eventually lost 1–3 to Lyon. On June 30, 2021, Rolfö left VfL Wolfsburg after the expiration of her contract. On 7 July 2021, she signed a two-year deal with Barcelona. On 4 September, Rolfö made her official debut for Barcelona when she came on for the last 18 minutes, replacing Mariona Caldentey in her side's 5–0 routing of Granadilla Tenerife. A week later, she scored her first goal for the club, when she slotted her side's fourth goal in another 5–0 victory against Real Betis. In January 2023, Rolfö extended her contract with Barcelona until June 2026. Rolfö scored the winning goal of the 2022–23 Champions League final, making it 3-2 against her former club VfL Wolfsburg and giving Barcelona their second Champions League title. On 5 September 2023, Rolfö announced that she would be undergoing keyhole surgery on the meniscus of her right knee. She returned from injury on 17 March 2024, and in her first match back, she opened scoring in the 8th minute for a 7–0 victory against UD Tenerife. Rolfö played for Sweden under-19 international team at the 2011–12 UEFA Under-19 Championship. She helped Sweden win the competition by defeating Spain 1–0 in extra time. Rolfö's club form with Linköping caught the eye of national team coach Pia Sundhage, who promptly handed Rolfö a debut cap in Sweden's 2–1 friendly defeat by Germany at Eyravallen on 29 October 2014. In her five-minute substitute appearance she almost scored but was denied by German goalkeeper Nadine Angerer. Rolfö played in the 2016 Summer Olympics at Rio de Janeiro helping Sweden to a silver medal after losing in the final to Germany. Rolfö did not feature in the 2–1 loss in the Gold Medal Match, after suffering a tournament ending injury in the quarter-final against the USWNT. On 16 June 2019, Rolfö scored her first goal in the 2019 World Cup in a 5–1 win over Thailand. Rolfö was selected to represent Sweden in the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo in 2021. She featured in every match except for Sweden's final group stage match against New Zealand. She scored three goals in five matches as her team won the silver medal again after being defeated 2–3 on penalties by Canada. On 13 June 2023, she was included in the 23-player squad for the FIFA 2023 World Cup . She scored the first goal in the 2-0 win over Australia for third place. Two weeks later, she underwent knee surgery to repair her meniscus, and was out for the rest of the year. Rolfö is currently in a relationship with Simon Skott, who she met in 2016. While at Wolfsburg, Rolfö was roommates with fellow national team teammate Madelen Janogy, who Rolfö helped tackle her mental health challenges.
