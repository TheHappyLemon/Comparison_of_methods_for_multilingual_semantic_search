.bw is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Botswana. It is officially administered by the Botswana Communication Regulatory Authority since 2013, previously being administered by the University of Botswana. Most current registrations are at the third level beneath second-level names such as co.bw and org.bw, but some second-level registrations also exist, such as Botswana Telecommunications Corporation's website. However, registrations at the second level have been stopped, and all entities who are currently registered under this level will be given a three year grace period to migrate to any other level. The most visited .bw domain is google.co.bw by Google Inc. in Botswana. Botswana Communication Regulatory Authority operates a WHOIS service for .bw domains and was previously operated by Botswana Telecommunications Corporation. ISO 3166-2:BW "BTC".
