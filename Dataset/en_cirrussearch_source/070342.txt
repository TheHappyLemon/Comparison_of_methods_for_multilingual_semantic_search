Tabuk, officially the City of Tabuk (Ilocano: Siudad ti Tabuk; Filipino: Lungsod ng Tabuk), is a 5th class component city and capital of the province of Kalinga, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 121,033 people. The former municipal district of Tabuk was transformed into a regular municipality by Republic Act No. 533, approved June 16, 1950. Tabuk became the Cordillera's second city after Baguio on June 23, 2007, when 17,060 voters ratified Republic Act No. 9404. On November 18, 2008, the Supreme Court voted 6–5 to revert Tabuk, among other 15 cities', status back to municipalities. However, on December 21, 2009, the court reversed its first decision, returning Tabuk and the 15 other municipalities back to cities again. It contended that these cities were not covered by Republic Act 9009 – the law enacted in June 2001 that increased the income requirement for cities from P20 million to P100 million – as proven by transcripts of Senate debates while crafting RA 9009. But on August 24, 2010, the court made a reversal again, reinstating its November 2008 decision, making Tabuk and the other 15 cities regular municipalities again. It concluded that the Local Government Code as amended by RA 9009 should be followed, without exception. Finally, on February 15, 2011, Tabuk and the 15 municipalities became cities again after the court made a third reversal. This time the court acknowledged, among others, that the 16 cityhood laws amended RA 9009, effectively amending the Local Government Code itself. After six years of legal battles, in its board resolution, the League of Cities of the Philippines acknowledged and recognized the cityhood of Tabuk and 14 other cities.
