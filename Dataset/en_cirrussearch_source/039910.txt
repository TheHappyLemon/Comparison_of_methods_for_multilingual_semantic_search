In early August 2018, Akinyemi went AWOL, resulting in his club, FK Ventspils filling a missing persons report amid fear the player had been kidnapped. Akinyemi returned to Ventspils a few days later, 13 August, playing in their win over FK Liepāja on the same day. On 16 August 2018, IK Start announced the signing of Akinyemi, on a contract until the end of the 2021 season, from FK Ventspils. After scoring 3 goals in Start's 2018 campaign which ended in relegation, in the 2019 1. divisjon season opener he broke his ankle. He was sidelined for a long time and failed to break into Start's first team after that. The former top scorer did not manage any goals during a loan to Hamkam in 2020 either. Following a goalless league run in 2021, Start decided to release him after the end of the 2021 season. On 6 February 2023, Karviná announced the signing of Akinyemi, from KF Laçi.
