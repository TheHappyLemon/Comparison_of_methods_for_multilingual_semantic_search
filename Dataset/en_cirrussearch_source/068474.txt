The Metropolitan City of Milan (Italian: città metropolitana di Milano; Milanese: cittaa metropolitana de Milan, Lombard: [tʃiˈtaː metrupuliˈtana de miˈlãː]) is a metropolitan city (not to be confused with the metropolitan area) in the Lombardy region of Italy. It is the second most populous metropolitan city in the nation after the Metropolitan City of Rome Capital. Its capital is the city of Milan. It replaced the province of Milan and includes the city of Milan and other 133 comuni (sg.: comune). It was first created by the reform of local authorities (Law 142/1990) and then established by the Law 56/2014. It has been operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City of Milan is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor (sindaco metropolitano) and by the Metropolitan Council (consiglio metropolitano). Since June 2016 Giuseppe Sala, as mayor of the capital city, has been the mayor of the Metropolitan City. The new Metro municipalities, giving large urban areas the administrative powers of a province, are conceived for improving the performance of local administrations and to slash local spending by better coordinating the municipalities in providing basic services (including transport, school and social programs) and environment protection. In this policy framework, the Mayor of Milan is designated to exercise the functions of Metropolitan mayor, presiding over a Metropolitan Council. The Council consists of mayors and city councillors of each comune in the Metropolitan City elected from amongst themselves using partially open list proportional representation, with seats allocated using the D'Hondt method. Metropolitan councillors are elected at-large for five-year terms; votes for metropolitan councillors are weighted by grouping comunes of a certain population range into nine groups so that votes of the mayors and city councillors of the more populous groups are worth than those of less populous groups. The first Metropolitan Council of the City was elected on 28 September 2014. The current Metropolitan Council of the City (2021-2026) was elected on 19 December 2021: The Metropolitan Council is seated at Palazzo Isimbardi, located in Milan.
