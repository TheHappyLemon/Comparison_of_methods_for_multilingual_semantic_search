The Burkina Faso national football team (French: Équipe de football du Burkina Faso) represents Burkina Faso in men's international football and is controlled by the Burkinabé Football Federation. They were known as the Upper Volta national football team until 1984, when Upper Volta became Burkina Faso. They finished fourth in the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations, when they hosted the tournament. Their best ever finish in the tournament was the 2013 edition, reaching the final. Their first international match was played on April 13, 1960, in the Jeux de la Communauté in Madagascar and ended with a 5–4 victory against Gabon. The country made their first appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations in 1978, but it was not until 1996 that they returned to the biennial tournament. They subsequently qualified for five consecutive tournaments between 1996 and 2004, reaching the semi-finals under coach Philippe Troussier when the tournament was held on home soil in 1998. Burkina Faso played in Group B of the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations alongside Ghana and Ivory Coast in a three-team group due to Togo's withdrawal. Although they drew their first match against Ivory Coast and needed just a draw against Ghana to progress, the Burkinabe lost 1–0 and failed to qualify for the knock-out stage of the tournament. Burkina Faso took part in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, losing all three of their matches and subsequently firing coach Paulo Duarte. Belgian coach Paul Put was announced as new coach in March 2012. Burkina Faso finished first of their group, but lost to Nigeria in the final of the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. The team would earn third place at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. Burkina Faso first entered the World Cup in the 1978 qualifying tournament, beating Mauritania in the preliminary round before losing 1–3 against Ivory Coast. They next entered World Cup qualifying in 1990, losing in the first round to Libya 2–3. Burkina Faso withdrew from the 1994 competition but returned in 1998, beating Mauritania again to make it to the final qualifying group stage, however they failed to obtain a single point, finishing bottom of their group. They beat Ethiopia in 2002 to again make it to the qualifying group stage, but did not advance, only winning one game against Malawi. The team had a strong showing in the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign, reaching the final round of qualifying where it faced Algeria. It won 3–2 in Ouagadougou, but lost 1–0 in Blida. Despite the 3-3 aggregate, Burkina Faso narrowly missed out on the 2014 World Cup due to the away goals rule. The team is nicknamed Les Etalons, which means "The Stallions". It is in reference to the legendary horse of Princess Yennenga. Supporters of the team at times include a percussion band, which often mimics the sounds of galloping horses at matches. The following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.   Win   Draw   Loss   Fixture Cape Verde  v  Burkina Faso Burkina Faso  v  Eswatini Morocco  v  Burkina Faso Equatorial Guinea  v  Burkina Faso Burkina Faso  v  Guinea-Bissau Ethiopia  v  Burkina Faso Iran  v  Burkina Faso DR Congo  v  Burkina Faso Burkina Faso  v  Mauritania Algeria  v  Burkina Faso Angola  v  Burkina Faso Mali  v  Burkina Faso Libya  v  Burkina Faso Niger  v  Burkina Faso Egypt  v  Burkina Faso Burkina Faso  v  Sierra Leone Otto Pfister (1976–1978) Heinz-Peter Überjahn (1988–1990) Idrissa Traoré (1992–1996) Calixte Zagre (1996) Ivan Vutov (1996–1997) Malik Jabir (1997) Philippe Troussier (1997–1998) Didier Notheaux (1998–1999) René Taelman (2000) Sidiki Diarra (2000–2001) Oscar Fulloné (2001–2002) Jacques Yaméogo & Pihouri Weboanga (2002) Jean-Paul Rabier (2002–2004) Ivica Todorov (2004–2005) Bernard Simondi (2005–2006) Idrissa Traoré (2006–2007) Didier Notheaux & Sidiki Diarra (2007) Paulo Jorge Rebelo Duarte (2008–2012) Paul Put (2012–2015) Gernot Rohr (2015) Paulo Duarte (2015–2019) Kamou Malo (2019–2022) Hubert Velud (2022–2024) Brama Traoré (2024-present) The following players were called up for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.
