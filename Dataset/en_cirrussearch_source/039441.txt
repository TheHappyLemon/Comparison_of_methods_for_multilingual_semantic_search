The surname Epstein (Yiddish: עפּשטײן, romanized: Epshteyn) is one of the oldest Ashkenazi Jewish family names. It is probably derived from the German town of Eppstein, in Hesse; the place-name was probably derived[citation needed] from Gaulish apa ("water", in the sense of a river) and German -stein ("stone", in the sense of a hill).
