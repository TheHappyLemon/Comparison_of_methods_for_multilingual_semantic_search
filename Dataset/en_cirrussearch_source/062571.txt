Motorcycle racing was featured in the Summer Olympic Games programme in 1900 (two events). These events have generally not been classified as official, although the IOC has never decided which events were "Olympic" and which were not. Events involving motorized transport were later excluded from the Games. Race A (1 mile): A. Jordan USA 2:10.0 Race B (1 mile): E.
