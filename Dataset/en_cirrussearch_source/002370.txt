These features were caused by the collision of large meteorites or comets with the Earth. For eroded or buried craters, the stated diameter typically refers to an estimate of original rim diameter, and may not correspond to present surface features. By EID convention, Russian and Asian craters are grouped together in the List of impact craters in Asia and Russia. The following structures are officially considered "unconfirmed" because they are not listed in the Earth Impact Database. Due to stringent requirements regarding evidence and peer-reviewed publication, newly discovered craters or those for which it is difficult to collect evidence are generally known for some time before becoming listed. However, entries on the unconfirmed list could still have an impact origin disproven.
