Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a 2009 American animated science fiction comedy film produced by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation, and released by Sony Pictures Releasing. Loosely based on the 1978 children's book of the same name by Judi and Ron Barrett, the film was written for the screen and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, in their feature directorial debuts. It stars the voices of Bill Hader, Anna Faris, James Caan, Andy Samberg, Bruce Campbell, Mr. T, Benjamin Bratt, and Neil Patrick Harris. The film centers around an aspiring inventor named Flint Lockwood who develops, following a series of failed experiments, a machine that can convert water into food. After the machine gains sentience and begins to develop food storms, Flint must stop it in order to save the world. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs premiered at the Mann Village Theater in Los Angeles, California on September 12, 2009, and was released in the United States six days later on September 18 of that same year. It earned $243 million worldwide on a budget of $100 million at the box office. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its colorful visuals, humor, characters, voice acting, and the score, while the simple character designs were said to be unfitting. The film has since been expanded into a franchise, with a sequel, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, released on September 27, 2013, as well as an animated television series based on the film that premiered on Cartoon Network on February 20, 2017, with none of the original cast returning. Aspiring scientist Flint Lockwood lives in Swallow Falls, a tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Sardines is the base of Swallow Falls' economy, but the Baby Brent Sardines cannery has gone bankrupt due to worldwide dislike of sardines. One day, Flint invents the "Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator" (FLDSMDFR), a machine that turns water into food, which ends up shorting out his house's electrical supply. Flint decides to power the machine by hooking it up to the large riser pole at the nearby power substation, sending it rocketing through town and subsequently destroying a park conceived by the townâ€™s mayor before ultimately shooting up into the sky. Afterwards, Flint meets Samantha "Sam" Sparks, a weather reporter intern whose big break was ruined by the incident. Brightly colored clouds then float over the town and begin to rain cheeseburgers, delighting the residents. Flint creates a communication device to send food orders to the machine, and Swallow Falls (now renamed Chewandswallow) becomes a successful "food tourism" destination. As Flint and Sam grow closer, Sam opens up to Flint about her history of being bullied and the shame she feels about her nerdy demeanor, though Flint insists she's beautiful the way she is. As the townsfolk become greedier, Flint notices that the food is growing larger. Despite Flint's concerns that the food is starting to "over mutate", Mayor Shelbourne, now morbidly obese, schemes to use the invention for personal gain. When a large tornado of spaghetti and meatballs ravages the town, Flint rushes to his lab to turn off the FLDSMDFR, but Shelbourne accidentally destroys the communication device after ordering a Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet. Now sentient, the FLDSMDFR creates a massive food storm that sends colossal food downpours to various cities and their landmarks. After gaining encouragement from his widowed father Tim, who is always annoyed by Flint's failed contraptions, Flint places the kill code in a USB flash drive, and builds a flying car to reach and destroy the FLDSMDFR, with the aid of Sam, her cameraman Manny, Flint's pet monkey Steve, and Brent McHale (namesake of the Baby Brent Sardines cannery). As they approach the machine in the sky, they find that it is now serving as the core of a giant meatball asteroid which it created. The machine sends living food to attack them, which causes Flint to lose the USB flash drive. Flint calls Tim and orders him to email the kill code file to his phone. As Sam, Brent and Flint enter the meatball, they are accosted by living roast chickens, one of which Brent manages to take control of after it eats him. Back in Chewandswallow, a dam containing leftovers collapses, creating an avalanche of food that destroys the town. Tim manages to re-send the code to Flint's cell phone. While lowering Flint down a tunnel using rope, Sam gets cut by a piece of peanut brittle, causing an allergic reaction. Flint implores Brent to take Sam back to the plane and get her a shot, but she refuses to let Flint go. They confess their love for each other before Flint cuts the rope and plummets down. Sam and Brent make it back to the plane after Brent fights off the roast chickens. While scuffling with the machine, Flint discovers that Tim accidentally sent him the wrong file. However, he uses his Spray-On Shoes formula to stop the machine, causing it and the giant meatball to explode, though also seemingly killing him. With the machine destroyed, the food storms subside and everyone is able to return safely to Chewandswallow. Flint is revealed to have survived the explosion by letting go of the machine and falling down the blowhole at the last second before the explosion. Tim finally shows his appreciation for his son and his inventions, and Flint and Sam celebrate with a kiss. Voice actors in the film include: Bill Hader as Flint Lockwood, an unsuccessful and timid but determined young inventor, and Sam's love interest. Hader also voices the FLDSMDFR, Flint's invention Max Neuwirth as the young Flint Anna Faris as Samantha "Sam" Sparks, a weather intern from New York City and later Flint's love interest Neil Patrick Harris as Steve, Flint's pet vervet monkey and best friend, who communicates through a thought translator Flint invented James Caan as Timothy "Tim" Lockwood, Flint's technophobic fisherman father Bruce Campbell as Mayor Shelbourne, Swallow Falls' corrupt mayor Andy Samberg as "Baby" Brent McHale, the arrogant and dim-witted namesake of the Baby Brent Sardines cannery Mr. T as Officer Earl Devereaux, Swallow Falls' athletic police officer and Cal's father Bobb'e J. Thompson as Calvin "Cal" Devereaux, Earl's young son Benjamin Bratt as Manny, Sam's Guatemalan cameraman and a former doctor, pilot and comedian Al Roker as Patrick Patrickson, the anchorman of Weather News Network in New York City Lauren Graham as Fran Lockwood, Flint's late mother who always believed in her son Will Forte as Joe Towne, a redneck citizen of Swallow Falls who appears in certain scenes throughout the film Angela V. Shelton as Regina Devereaux, Earl's wife and Cal's mother On May 9, 2003, a year after establishment, Sony Pictures Animation announced its first animated slate, including Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, a film adaptation of the book of the same name. The Brizzi brothers were brought to direct the film, with Wayne Rice adapting the screenplay. In 2006, it was reported that the film had been helmed by new directors and writers, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. The duo said later that year that it would be a homage to, and a parody of, disaster films such as Twister, Armageddon, The Core, and The Day After Tomorrow. After a year working on the script, Lord and Christopher Miller were fired for story issues and replaced with new writers, who after a year were also fired. Lord and Miller were then re-hired in 2006. The two completely redid the script, this time with the creative input of their crew. The new draft had the protagonist as a failed inventor who wanted to prove himself to his town. The two were almost fired again after Amy Pascal, then-head of Sony Pictures, criticized the film for lack of story. Although the film succeeded on the comedic front in the animatic stage, Pascal cited the lack of an anchoring relationship in the film as a failure in the story telling. Unable to create new characters and environments to suit the new story demands, the two elevated the character of the tackle shop extra to be the protagonist's father, thereby creating the relationship Pascal had requested. The pair's experience on Cloudy taught them two valuable lessons: the power of creative collaboration and the importance of emotion in a story. On September 18, 2008, Variety announced that Bill Hader and Anna Faris had signed on to voice the two lead characters, with James Caan, Bruce Campbell, Mr. T, Andy Samberg, Neil Patrick Harris, Bobb'e J. Thompson, Benjamin Bratt, Al Roker, Lauren Graham, and Will Forte also in the voice cast. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is the second film after Monster House that was made using the animation-rendering software Arnold. Justin K. Thompson served as production designer.

Ernest Hardy of LA Weekly stated the film "is smart, insightful on a host of relationship dynamics, and filled with fast-paced action". Hardy also applauded the 3-D effects which "are wonderful, full of witty sight gags that play out both center-screen and on the periphery". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film a mixed review stating that "Crazy doesn't always equal funny, and the gigantism of this 3-D offering's second half puts a damper on your enjoyment. But look: This film wasn't made for you, or me. It was made for dangerously, easily distracted 9-year-olds."
