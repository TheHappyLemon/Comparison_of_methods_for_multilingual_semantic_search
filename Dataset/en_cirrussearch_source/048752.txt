During the 2019–20 season, on 7 January 2020, Mikkola made his NHL debut with the Blues against the San Jose Sharks. Following his second full season with the Blues in 2021–22, Mikkola as a restricted free agent was signed to a one-year, $1.9 million contract extension on 17 July 2022. During the 2022–NHL season, Mikkola registered three assists through 50 regular season games before he was traded by the Blues on 9 February 2023, alongside Vladimir Tarasenko, to the New York Rangers in exchange for a conditional first-round selection in 2023 NHL Entry Draft and fourth-round selection in 2024, Samuel Blais and Hunter Skinner.
