From 1919 to 1961, it was located in a building at Tavricheskaya Street, 35. This was the informal name of the art school.

In the 20th century, the Tavricheskaya Art School repeatedly altered its official name and address. Since 1992 the art school, which had been called the Saint Petersburg Art School, was renamed after Nicholas Roerich. The history of the Tavricheskaya Art School dates back to 1839 when the Drawing School for free visit opened in the building of Saint Petersburg Customs. In 1858 the Drawing School transferred to the "Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts". In 1878 the Drawing School moved to Bolshaya Morskaya Street, 38. Here Nicholas Roerich headed the establishment from 1906 to 1918. At different times its teaching staff included such artists and teachers as Ivan Kramskoy, Pavel Chistyakov, Leon Benois. After the 1917 October Revolution, in July 1918, by the initiative of the People's Commissar of Education Anatoli Lunacharsky, the Art School resumed as free "Courses of Drawing" located at Liteyny Prospect. At the end of 1918, courses are converted to "Art School and Workshop". In July 1919, the school moved to Tavricheskaya street, 35, which later gave the school its unofficial name: "Tavricheskaya Art School". Here the Art School remained until 1961. Its official name changed several times: "Art and Industrial College", "Art and Pedagogical College", "The Leningrad Art School". In the years 1930-1950, the director Jan Konstantinovich Shablovsky played a role in consolidating the Tavricheskaya Art School.
