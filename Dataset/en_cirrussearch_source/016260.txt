Hockey Club Ambrì-Piotta is a Swiss professional ice hockey club and a member of the National League (NL). The club was founded September 19, 1937, and is also known as "Bianco-Blu" (English: white and blues). Though they have never won the league championship, the club has not been relegated to the Swiss League since being promoted in 1985, the same year that saw the arrival of Dale McCourt. The team plays its home games in the 7,000-seat Nuova Valascia. Ambrì and Piotta are two small villages in the municipality of Quinto, located in the northern part of the valley Leventina canton Ticino, with a combined population of 500 people. Ambrì-Piotta has more than 40 fan clubs all over Europe. For major events, like the derby against southern rivals HC Lugano, the fans compose a choreography. When Ambrì wins a game, fans rejoice to the valley anthem "La Montanara". Since 1959, they have called their self-owned Valascia as their home. Standing 1,000 metres above sea level, it is an open-ended facility with 2,000 seats and additional standing room space for 5,000. In the summer of 2013, the team raised roughly five million Swiss francs in response to financial difficulties. The donations given to HC Ambrì-Piotta came from both large and small donations, many of which were given via SMS. The efforts of the team and its fans have secured the right to play in the National League.
