John is crowned at Scone, on November 30, on St. Andrew's Day. Scotland's castles are returned to the powerful magnates. December – John Balliol is summoned by Edward I (Longshanks) to Westminster to answer an appeal by Macduff of Fife against a judgment imposed on him by the Scottish Parliament.

Mamluk forces under Sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil accompanied by his vizier Ibn al-Sal'us arrive in Damascus. Khalil travels via Aleppo to besiege the castle of Qal'at ar-Rum ("Castle of the Romans"), which is the official seat of Stephen IV, patriarch of Armenia. The Mamluks besiege the castle with more than 30 catapults and capture it after 30 days. Al-Ashraf Khalil returns to Damascus and assembles an army to attack Sis, the capital of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.
