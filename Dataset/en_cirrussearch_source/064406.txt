Ajdin Hrustic (Bosnian: Ajdin Hrustić; born 5 July 1996) is an Australian professional soccer player who plays as an attacking midfielder for Dutch Eredivisie club Heracles Almelo and the Australia national team. Born in Dandenong, Victoria Hrustic played youth football with South Melbourne and Schalke 04 before moving to FC Groningen, where he made his professional debut in 2017. In 2020 he signed for the German football club Eintracht Frankfurt. In June 2015, Hrustic signed a three-year contract with FC Groningen, his first senior professional deal. He made his competitive debut for the club as a substitute in a draw against AZ Alkmaar on 2 April 2017. His first goal for the club came two weeks later, with a shot from long range to seal a 5–1 win over PEC Zwolle. On 28 September 2020, Hrustic signed a contract with German Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt that will keep him at the club through to 2023, and was given the No. 7 jersey. He made his debut on 19 December 2020 in a 2–0 victory against FC Augsburg, coming off the bench for Aymen Barkok. Hrustic scored his first goal for Eintracht Frankfurt against Mainz 05, on 9 May 2021, with an improvised finish where he managed to chip the ball over goalkeeper Robin Zentner. On 18 May 2022, Hrustic became the first Australian player to win the UEFA Europa League in its history, after Eintracht Frankfurt triumphed over Scottish opponent Rangers in the 2022 final, winning a penalty shootout 5–4 after the match ended 1–1 after extra time, with Hrustic converting his team's second penalty of the shootout. He became the first Australian since Harry Kewell in 2005 to win a major UEFA competition. On 1 September 2022, Hrustic signed a four-year contract with Hellas Verona in Italy. On 1 February 2024, Hrustic returned to the Netherlands and signed with Heracles Almelo until the end of the season. Due to his Bosnian and Romanian heritage, Hrustic was eligible to represent Bosnia and Herzegovina and Romania internationally, in addition to his birth country Australia. He was contacted by the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina in May 2017, but ultimately rejected the offer and expressed his wish to represent the Socceroos. Hrustic was called up to an Australian under-23 development squad in March 2017. This was the first time Hrustic had been involved with Football Federation Australia in several years, having previously not been involved with the Australian setup since moving to Europe. On 22 May 2017, Hrustic was named in the Australian national side's 30-man preliminary squad for the month of June, including the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, a friendly against Brazil and a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia. He was retained in the final 23-man squad. He made his Socceroos debut on the losing side of a 4–0 friendly against Brazil, coming on as a 57th-minute substitute. On 4 June 2021, Hrustic scored his first goal for Australia against Kuwait in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying match, bending the ball off the inside of the post and in from a 30-odd-metre free-kick. His second goal also came off a free-kick bouncing off the crossbar to go in underneath the goal against Japan in 2021. He was included into the 2022 FIFA World Cup squad, playing in three matches as Australia reached the round of sixteen. Hrustic was born in Dandenong a suburb of Melbourne, Australia to a Bosnian father and a Romanian mother.
