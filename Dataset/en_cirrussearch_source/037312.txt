Ilya Leontievich Rabinovich (Russian: Илья Леонтьевич Рабинович; 11 May 1891 – 23 April 1942) was a Russian and later Soviet chess player, among the best in his country for three decades, from 1910 to 1940. His best result was a shared first place in the 9th Soviet Championship of 1934-35. He was also a chess writer. Rabinovich was born in Saint Petersburg. In 1911 he tied for first place with Platz in Saint Petersburg. In 1912 he tied for 4th-5th in Vilnius (Hauptturnier; Karel Hromádka won). In July–August 1914 he played in Mannheim, Germany at the 19th DSB Congress. When the chess congress had to be interrupted upon the outbreak of World War I, Rabinovich was tied for 2nd-3rd places in the Hauptturnier A. After the declaration of war against Russia, eleven players from the Russian Empire (Alexander Alekhine, Efim Bogoljubov, Fedor Bogatyrchuk, Alexander Flamberg, N. Koppelman, Boris Maljutin, Rabinovich, Peter Romanovsky, Peter Petrovich Saburov, Alexey Selezniev, and Samuil Weinstein) from the Mannheim tournament were interned by Germany. In September 1914, four of them (Alekhine, Bogatyrchuk, Saburov, and Koppelman) were freed and allowed, through Switzerland, to return home. The Russian internees played eight tournaments, the first in Baden-Baden (1914) and all the others in Triberg im Schwarzwald (1914–1917). Rabinovich was 3rd in Baden-Baden (Alexander Flamberg won), 2nd at Triberg 1914/15, 2nd at Triberg 1915, 3rd at Triberg 1915, tied for 2nd-3rd at Triberg 1915, took 2nd at Triberg 1915/16 (all tournaments were won by Bogoljubov). In 1916 Rabinovich won the Triberg chess tournament, and he tied for first with Selezniev at Triberg 1917. After World War I, Rabinovich returned to St Petersburg (Petrograd, Leningrad). In 1920 he won the Petrograd chess championship, and came fourth in Moscow in the All-Russian Chess Olympiad (later recognized as the first Soviet chess championship), which was won by Alexander Alekhine. In 1922 he took second, behind Grigory Levenfish, in the Petrograd championship. In 1923 he tied for 7th-8th at Leningrad (2nd USSR Championship, won by Peter Romanovsky). In 1923 he won at Novgorod. In 1924 he took 2nd, behind Levenfish, in the Leningrad championship. In 1924 he took 5th in Moscow (3rd USSR Ch., won by Bogoljubov).

In 1927 Rabinovich wrote the first original book devoted to the endgame in the Russian language, titled The Endgame in Russian and The Russian Endgame Handbook in English. It was updated in 1938. It is said to be a major reason for the dominance of Soviet players in the endgame. In 1927 he tied for 10-12th in Moscow (5th USSR Championship). The event was won by Fedor Bohatirchuk and Peter Romanovsky. In 1928, he won the Leningrad championship. In 1933 he tied for 3rd-5th in Leningrad (8th USSR Championship, won by Botvinnik).
