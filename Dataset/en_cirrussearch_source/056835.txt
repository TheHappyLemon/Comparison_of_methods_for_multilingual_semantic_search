The Russian Fifth Army was a World War I Russian field army that fought on the Eastern Front. The 5th Army saw action at the Battle of Rawa, (3–11 September 1914). Under the command of General Pavel Plehve, they advanced into a forty-mile gap in the Austrian line between the Austrian First and Fourth armies. The Austrian chief of staff, General Franz Conrad, ordered a general retreat: the Austrians fell back over one hundred miles and lost 350,000 men. The Germans then moved troops from the Prussian front to stop a potential Austrian collapse.
