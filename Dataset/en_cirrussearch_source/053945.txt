Angry Birds is a Finnish action, puzzle, and strategy based media franchise created by Rovio Entertainment, and owned by Sega. The game series focuses on the eponymous flock of colorful angry birds who try to save their eggs from green-colored pigs. Inspired by the game Crush the Castle, the game has been praised for its successful combination of fun gameplay, comical style, and low price. Its popularity led to many spin-offs; versions of Angry Birds created for PCs and video game consoles, a market for merchandise featuring its characters, Angry Birds Toons, a televised animated series, and two films; The Angry Birds Movie and its sequel The Angry Birds Movie 2. By January 2014, there had been over 2 billion downloads across all platforms, including both regular and special editions. By July 2015, the series' games had been downloaded more than 3 billion times collectively, making it the most downloaded freemium game series of all time. The original Angry Birds has been called "One of the most mainstream games out right now," "One of the great runaway hits of 2010", and "The largest mobile app success the world has seen so far". The first main-series video game sequel, Angry Birds 2, was released on 30 July 2015. The first game in the series was initially released on 11 December 2009 for iOS. At the time, the 2009 swine flu epidemic was in the news, so the staff decided to use pigs as the enemies of the Angry Birds. The company released ports of the game to other touchscreen smartphone operating systems, including Android. In early 2019, all remaining Angry Birds games released before October 2014 (with the exception of Friends) were discontinued and removed from app stores, though Bad Piggies was added back in early 2020. Rovio has declined to explain their reasoning behind the decision apart from a brief tweet and support response, both giving different answers. However, in June 2021, by popular demand of the fans, Rovio announced that the classic games will be available on the stores again sometime in the future. A recreated version of the original Angry Birds game known as Rovio Classics: Angry Birds came to mobile platforms on 31 March 2022. In August 2023, Sega acquired Rovio Entertainment. The deal was closed on 17 August 2023. These games were soft-launched in select countries but were discontinued after a few months of its release. Some of them never made a release. From 2011 to 17, Angry Birds has collaborated with many other companies and released variations of the game in the respective companies' theme. Most of them were Flash-based. All of the games featured exclusive levels and elements that aid in promotion.

Red (formerly known as Red Bird, full name Red J. Bird) is a temperamental red desert cardinal and the leader of the Angry Birds flock. He was the first bird introduced in the original Angry Birds game. Red is in charge of looking after the birds' nest of eggs, and coming up with plans to attack the pigs. He is the most responsible and mature in the flock, but is also known for having severe anger issues. Despite this, he has a soft side that only shows when he is with his friends or comforting the eggs. Red is very overprotective, and would risk his life to make sure the eggs are safe and sound. Chuck (formerly known as Yellow Bird) is a yellow triangular bird who was born with the ability to run at the speed of sound. Chuck is cocky and self-loving, but also very energetic. He spends a lot of his spare time playing games and hanging out with his closest friends. He is also very loyal and prioritizes the eggs' safety more than anything. Bomb (formerly known as Black Bird or Bomb Bird) is a large black (or sometimes purple) bird diagnosed with a fictional disability called IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder), which makes him explode upon having sudden emotional reactions such as anger and fear. This makes Bomb the most powerful in the flock, although he doesn't ever brag about it as he is often calm and reserved until something goes wrong or doesn't go his way. He is close friends with almost every bird in the flock, and is loyal to all of them. Jay, Jake and Jim (nicknamed The Blues and formerly known as the Blue Birds) are cyan blue bird triplets who hatched from the same egg. They are some of the youngest and smallest in the flock, and share the same mischievous and cheeky thoughts and views. They often get into trouble due to this, but they enjoy putting their skills to good use against the pigs. Matilda (formerly known as White Bird) is a female cream white bird and the mother figure of the flock. She's the least angry in the flock and the most peaceful. Matilda loves animals, nature, peace, and her favourite hobby is gardening. However, she has been prone to having bursts of anger herself in the past. Matilda has tried repeatedly to educate the birds in controlling their anger, but it has never worked out. Despite this, she is very lovable and kind-hearted. Hal (formerly known as Green Bird or Boomerang Bird) is a green, long-beaked bird who is considered the black sheep of the flock. He doesn't get angry often and doesn't like to get involved with the fight against the pigs unless it really matters to him. Because of his long beak, Hal has the ability to act like a boomerang, which he often uses as an attack. Terence (formerly known as Big Brother Bird) is a maroon bird the biggest in the flock. He is a silent-but-deadly brute that hardly expresses any sort of emotion or movement, as he only speaks in growls. Terence is easily the most destructive bird, making him the most threatening to the pigs and even some of the birds. Bubbles (formerly known as Orange Bird) is an orange bird the youngest and smallest in the entire flock. He is obsessed with eating candy and sweets non-stop and loves Halloween. His special ability is inflating his body to grow to a gigantic size, flattening anything or anyone in his path. Stella (formerly known as Pink Bird) is a female pink bird who is often very adventurous and energetic. She loves blowing bubbles and hanging out with her best friends. Her homeland is Golden Island, the location of her starring game Angry Birds Stella. She has a short temper similar to Red but is able to control it and use it to her advantage. Silver is a female grey bird introduced in Angry Birds 2. When the pigs successfully stole an egg, it soon hatched into Silver. She was raised by the pigs before eventually joining the flock. Silver can perform somersaults to wipe out towers and tall structures built by the pigs. Melody is a female beige-coloured bird introduced in a post-launch update to Angry Birds 2. She grew up surrounded by music, giving her a strong interest and love for it. She doesn't easily get angry, but expresses herself through song when she is. When Melody sings at the top of her lungs, she inhales everything in front of her, which she can shoot out like bullets as an attack. Poppy is an energetic yellow female introduced in Angry Birds Stella. Her favourite hobby is to play drums, especially when playing music with her friends. Willow is a blue female bird who appears in Angry Birds Stella, and wears an orange striped knit cap and loves to paint and create art. Willow also made a cameo appearance in The Angry Birds Movie, where she was voiced by Charli XCX. Dahlia is a tan-coloured female who appears in Angry Birds Stella. She is a scientist, and is often in her laboratory performing experiments. Luca is the only male member of Stella's flock. He is also the youngest, meaning he doesn't like to follow the rules often. Gale is the main antagonist of Angry Birds Stella. Gale is a former friend of Stella, but betrayed her and the others when she discovered a crown and became the leader of a large army of pigs. In the Angry Birds Stella television series, her main goal was finding the Golden Egg with her Minion Pigs. Mighty Eagle is a gigantic eagle who lives in a cave in the tallest mountain on Bird Island. He is considered a mythical legend by the flock because he is the only bird who can fly. He likes to be isolated, which is why he refuses to join the flock. Zeta is a female purple eagle who appears as a main antagonist in The Angry Birds Movie 2 and Angry Birds Reloaded. She is the leader of Eagle Island, and her motive is destroying Bird Island and Piggy Island so she and her team of eagles can turn them into her own personal paradise. Zeta has a high level of intelligence, being described by her ex-fianc√©e, Mighty Eagle, as "the smartest girl in school". Tony (formerly known as Blue Terence) is Terence's sky blue cousin who lives in Finland. He is only playable in Angry Birds Seasons, and enjoys spending time with his cousin, fishing and watching the Northern Lights. Ice Bird is an extraterrestrial being from outer space, who made a one-time appearance in Angry Birds Space before reappearing in Angry Birds Reloaded several years later. He met the flock when he came down to the Angry Birds' home planet looking for his Eggstroid which, alongside the flock's eggs, was stolen by the pigs. Ice Bird is very mysterious and reserved, but has the ability to turn anything within his radius into cold solid ice. Jo is a non-binary turquoise and black bird who was introduced to celebrate LGBT Pride Month 2023. They enjoy dancing, and hopes to help make the world a better place to live in despite being shy. Jo has yet to make an appearance as a playable character, but they were featured in a limited-time event in Angry Birds 2, temporarily replacing the rubber ducks in the game's Golden Duck spell. King Pig (also known as King Smooth Cheeks) is the tyrannical, diabolical and greedy ruler of all of the pigs on Piggy Island. For years, he has been focused on his army of Minion Pigs capturing the birds' eggs for him to eat. His loyal subjects are forced to constantly humour and serve him, all while trying to steal the eggs. His big secret is that he has never eaten eggs before, and so has an unhealthy obsession with eating the birds' eggs, as the only pig who is allowed to do so. The Minion Pigs are small pigs that are King Pig's subjects and the inhabitants of Pig City, the capital of Piggy Island. Stupid by nature, the Minion Pigs are in the lowest rank of the Piggy kingdom society, despite some having occupations as engineers or pilots. They love to have fun and to serve King Pig. Big Bork (also known as Fat Pig) is a giant, fat pig who is an antagonist of Angry Birds Space, then reappearing in Angry Birds Reloaded. He was shown being frozen inside a giant planet of ice in the episode "Cold Cuts", which he was stuck inside of. Later on in the events of Angry Birds Space, he managed to escape the planet, and possibly took a huge bite out of another icy planet in the episode "Fry Me to the Moon". He appears again in the food planet Utopia, where he was briefly seen "eating" the eggsteroid. When Big Bork was fighting Super Red and the flock, he was defeated. He turned back into a small minion pig, and never bothered eating the eggsteroid and defeating the flock ever again. Alien Pig is an alien pig who is an antagonist of Angry Birds Space. He only appears in the "Cosmic Crystals" episode, where he got his own saucer to kidnapping the regular piggies to stuck them inside the ball crystals. Alien Pig was trying to defeat the Angry Birds by collecting the tiny crystals to make the ball crystals to make the flock go down. But he was defeated by the flock, and possibly got destroyed for good. Ross (formerly known as Freckled Pig) is a Minion Pig who is a supporting antagonist of the Angry Birds series and the main playable protagonist of the game Bad Piggies. His occupation is to build vehicles, which he often pilots to help capture the eggs. Ross reappears in The Angry Birds Movie and Bad Piggies 2, the latter of which sees Ross as a middle-aged uncle who guides his nephew (the game's protagonist) on how to build and drive vehicles. Chef Pig (also known as Scientist Pig) is the palace chef of Piggy Island, notable for his handlebar mustache and chef hat. As revealed in one episode in Angry Birds Toons, his desire in life is to usurp King Pig's role as the ruler of Piggy Island. While being a professional cook, he is also shown to be conducting scientific experiments, often utilizing them to trick the birds so that he could cook their eggs. However, these experiments often fail in the end. Chronicler Pig is a pig wearing glasses and a judge wig, appearing exclusively in select episodes of Angry Birds Toons. Corporal Pig (formerly known as Helmet Pig) is the bossy commander of the Minion Pigs. He is the one who comes up with plans to steal the eggs. He spends all day shouting at his minions, using fear to put them in order. Corporal Pig idolizes King Pig and will do absolutely anything to satisfy him. Foreman Pig (also known as Mustache Pig) is an elder mustachioed pig and a secondary antagonist of the series. He is responsible and dedicated, although bossy at most times. He is very loyal to his superiors, as he has no doubt in helping King Pig with any problem he has no matter how ridiculous it is. Foreman Pig is known for being an expert at building vehicles and machines, which he can drive with ease. Handsome Pig (also known as Hamsome Pig) is a blonde haired pig who only appears in Angry Birds Stella. He serves as Gale's right-hand man and consistently attempts to seduce Gale in the television series. Professor Pig is an elderly bespectacled pig, possibly the smartest pig on Piggy Island. He seems to be a pacifist, as he hates it when the birds battle against the pigs, especially when Foreman Pig steals his blueprint of peaceful inventions as a design to build an egg-napping contraption. Leonard is a bearded pig from the Angry Birds movies and an ancestor of King Pig. He is very confident, enthusiastic and scheming as, in The Angry Birds Movie, he tricked the birds into gaining their trust. Although, he was easily frustrated by Red's complaints and suspicions, mocking him underneath his breath, and has a mindset of not being worried about the consequences of his actions. He would later appear as a playable character in Angry Birds 2 and Angry Birds Reloaded. Rovio is investigating ways to expand the Angry Birds brand, including merchandise, television shows and movies. Mikael Hed, CEO of Rovio Mobile, has envisioned a feature film in the stop-motion animation style of Aardman Animations, famous for the Wallace and Gromit franchise. To that end, Rovio has purchased a Helsinki-based animation studio to prepare Angry Birds short cartoons on the Nicktoons station's Nickelodeon Extra, the first of which was a Christmas special named "Wreck the Halls" that debuted in December 2011. Hed acknowledges that such a film would be years away, and that Rovio must keep the characters relevant until then, by producing sequels or new ports of the original game.

There have been several toys made from Angry Birds characters. The game's official website offers plush versions of the birds and pigs for sale, along with T-shirts featuring the game's logo and characters. In May 2011, Mattel released an Angry Birds board game, titled "Angry Birds: Knock on Wood". Over 10 million Angry Birds toys have been sold thus far. Rovio opened the first official Angry Birds retail store in Helsinki on 11 November 2011 at 11:11¬†a.m. local time. It expects to open its next retail store somewhere in China, considered the game's fastest-growing market. Merchandise has been successful, with 45% of Rovio's revenues in 2012 coming from branded merchandise. The most notable toys are the Telepods, created by Hasbro. These figures are created for Angry Birds Star Wars II, Angry Birds Go!, Angry Birds Stella, and Angry Birds Transformers. Telepods use a similar digital toy hybrid concept as Skylanders or Disney Infinity characters, but there is a different technology behind it. These are figures used to "teleport" a character of the corresponding figure into the game by scanning a tiny QR code via the device's camera. The Telepod platform technology was invented by ReToy, a bMuse company, in partnership with Hasbro. Telepods figures are not only for this use, but can also be used with the toy set that comes with the toy, like other Angry Birds board games.

At the 2011 South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, Nokia used scrims on a downtown building to project an advertisement for its new N8 handset that included the game's characters. A June 2011 T-Mobile advertisement filmed in Barcelona, Spain included a real-life mock-up of the game in a city plaza, while Nokia used the game in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to promote an attempt to set a world record for the largest number of people playing a single mobile game. Finnair has also used Angry Birds in their advertising, including taping an Airbus A340 airliner with the Angry Birds figures and holding an Angry Birds tournament on board a flight to Singapore. Rovio has also prepared a number of web-based promotional variants of Angry Birds themed around creations of other companies, such as Finnish snack company Fazer, Spanish pizza delivery chain Telepizza, and Japanese television network Fuji TV, as well as promotions of American brands including Cheetos, Wonderful Pistachios and Coca-Cola. In November 2013, Indian brand Parle started a marketing campaign in which a trading card is included in each packet of Parle's Wafers and it included a related contest to win Angry Birds merchandise. In February 2016, Cadbury India had Angry Birds small figurines or tattoos in Cadbury Gems packs or Surprise balls. In June 2016, Kurkure India started an offer to win daily themed prizes and a trip to Angry Birds Activity Park in Malaysia. Finnish Formula One driver Heikki Kovalainen used an Angry Birds-themed helmet in the 2012 season, following a sponsorship deal with Rovio. Angry Birds also sponsored the Lotus F1 Team that year, with its logo on the top of each Lotus Renault F1 car's nosecone. As part of the deal, fellow Finn Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen ran an Angry Birds 'Space' logo on his branded caps. Hockey Bird, an angry hockey playing bird, was the official mascot of the 2012 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships. It was designed by Toni Kysenius and Rovio Entertainment. Premier League association football club Everton F.C. signed a deal with Rovio in 2017, whereby the Angry Birds logo appears on the club shirt's left sleeve beginning from the 2017‚Äì18 Premier League campaign. The game's popularity has spawned knock-off and parody games that utilize the same basic mechanics as Angry Birds. For example, Angry Turds features monkeys hurling feces and other objects at hunters who have stolen their babies. Another game, titled Chicks'n'Vixens and released in beta form on Windows Phone devices, replaces the birds and pigs with chickens and foxes, respectively. The developer of Chicks'n'Vixens intended the game as a challenge to Rovio Mobile, which stated at the time that a Windows Phone port of Angry Birds would not be ready until later in 2011. The Angry Birds theme song (Balkan Blast Remix) and its characters appear in Just Dance 2016. Angry Birds has inspired works of religious analogy. A five-part essay titled "Angry Birds Yoga¬†‚Äî How to Eliminate the Green Pigs in Your Life" was written by Giridhari Dasa of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness of Brazil, utilizing the characters and gameplay mechanics to explain various concepts of yoga in Gaudiya Vaishnavism as understood and interpreted by the Hare Krishna. The piece attracted much media attention, in Brazil and abroad, for its unique method of philosophico-religious presentation. The piece was also recognized and appreciated by Rovio Mobile's Peter Vesterbacka, who was prompted to comment on Twitter, "Very cool! I can see Angry Birds Yoga becoming a worldwide craze;-)". Rovio also launched the Angry Birds Playground in partnership with University of Helsinki. Based on the Finnish national curriculum the program covers maths, science, music, language, arts & crafts, physical education and social interaction. Focused on preschoolers of kindergarten age, the program introduced interactive learning material including books, posters, games and digital content. In 2015, a spin-off from the Rovio Angry Birds Playground was established as Fun Academy by co-founder and CEO Sanna Lukander, former Rovio's vice president of learning and book publishing, and co-founder Peter Vesterbacka¬†[fi], former Rovio's 'Mighty Eagle'. Fun Academy is currently[when?] present in 9 countries across the world.[citation needed] During the 2023 Israel‚ÄìHamas war, graphic ads supporting Israel showed up in Angry Birds and other video games for children. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said it had instructed advertisers to block the ads for viewers under the age of 18. Rovio subsequently banned the ads manually. In January 2014, it was revealed that Angry Birds was considered a "leaky app" and was used to collect data about its users including their sexual orientation and location by the National Security Agency (NSA) and GCHQ. In retaliation, anti-NSA hackers defaced Rovio's website. Claims were made by Edward Snowden that the app was leaky and that they were capable of siphoning data. According to The Register, the information was leaked through the in-game advertisement code like that embedded by Millennial Media: "Millennial's tracking software generates a personal record for each user that can store information from their political affiliation and sexual orientation to whether their marital state was single, married, divorced, engaged or 'swinger'. This information is used to target in-app ads more effectively, and can be collected by UK and US intelligence agencies for analysis." In a statement to the press, Rovio denied that they were providing any information to the intelligence agencies, but did not exclude the possibility that their advertisers might do so. Following this revelation, on 29 January, the Angry Birds site was defaced by hackers who replaced it with "Spying Birds" via a DNS hijacking attack. According to Rovio, "The defacement was caught in minutes and corrected immediately". The Syrian Electronic Army tweeted after the incident that the attack had been carried out by "a friend" of theirs. Video Games portal Boom Blox "Angry Birds Creator Has First Original Idea".
