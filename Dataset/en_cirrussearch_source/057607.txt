Napalm Records is an Austrian independent record label focused on heavy metal, hard rock and folk/folk rock/folk metal. Originally, Napalm focused on black metal bands, such as Abigor and Summoning, and folk metal bands, such as Falkenbach and Vintersorg. The label later expanded its roster by adding gothic metal, symphonic metal, power metal, doom metal, metalcore and nu metal bands, as well as stoner rock acts Monster Magnet, Karma to Burn, and Brant Bjork, and even folk bands like Ye Banished Privateers. Napalm has its own publishing house named Iron Avantgarde Publishing. In November 2020, Napalm acquired the German record label SPV GmbH. 1914 Æther Realm Accept Ad Infinitum Adept Agathodaimon The Agonist Ahab Alestorm Alien Weaponry Alissa Alter Bridge Amberian Dawn Andrew W.K.
