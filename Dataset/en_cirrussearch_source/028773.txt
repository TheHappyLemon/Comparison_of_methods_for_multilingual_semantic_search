Vilsandi National Park (Estonian: Vilsandi rahvuspark) is a marine protected area in Saaremaa Parish, Saare County, Estonia. It includes part of the island of Vilsandi, a number of smaller islands, adjacent parts of western Saaremaa including Harilaid peninsula. The park grew from a bird reserve founded in 1910. It is a highly sensitive ecosystem, which is used as a stop-over area by many migratory birds, like barnacle geese and Steller's eider, and as a breeding and nesting ground for over 247 species of birds, of which the most common is the eider duck. One third of all protected plant species in Estonia can also be found in the national park. Hunting is absolutely prohibited. This park is a popular tourist destination for both Estonians and foreign visitors, particularly from Finland.
