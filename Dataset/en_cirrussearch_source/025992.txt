Quincey played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Detroit Red Wings, Los Angeles Kings, Colorado Avalanche, Tampa Bay Lightning, New Jersey Devils, Columbus Blue Jackets, and the Minnesota Wild. Quincey grew up in the Caledon, Ontario, area playing most of his minor hockey for the Halton Hurricanes AAA program of the OMHA. He was drafted in the third round, 47th overall, of the 2001 OHL Priority Selection by the London Knights. Quincey was drafted 132nd overall by the Detroit Red Wings in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft after finishing his first Major junior hockey season with the Knights in 2002–03. At the beginning of the 2003–04 season in early October, Quincey was traded from London to the Mississauga IceDogs in a blockbuster deal for star forward Rob Schremp. Quincey helped the IceDogs to the OHL Final in 2004 before the IceDogs were swept in four games by the Guelph Storm. Developing as an offensively-able defensive-defenceman, Quincey was named in the OHL Second All-Star Team in the 2004–05 season after finishing with 46 points in 59 games. Selected as the Eastern Conference's Best Defensive Defenceman, he also placed third in voting for the OHL's top defenceman award, the Max Kaminsky Trophy. On July 28, 2005, Quincey was signed by the Detroit Red Wings to a three-year, entry level contract. He was assigned to the Wings' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins, to begin his first professional season in 2005–06. He finished the season fifth among rookie defencemen in the AHL with seven goals and 33 points in 70 games, while also making his NHL debut with Detroit against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on November 25, 2005. Quincey was again assigned to the Griffins the following season. As a late call-up, he scored his first NHL goal in the last game of the Red Wings' 2006–07 regular season in a 7–2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on April 7, 2007. He scored in the second period against Patrick Lalime, which turned out to be the final Red Wing goal of the regular season. After injuries to defencemen Niklas Kronwall and Mathieu Schneider, Quincey was thrust into play just as the playoffs had begun. He first played in Game 6, an overtime victory for Detroit against the Calgary Flames that enabled the Wings to move on to the second round to play the San Jose Sharks. After dispatching San Jose, the Red Wings eventually lost to the Anaheim Ducks in six games in the Western Conference Final. Slated to make the Detroit roster after an impressive 13-game playoff performance, Kyle suffered a setback after suffering a broken hand in training camp, forcing him to miss the entire 2007–08 pre-season. Quincey returned and played the majority of the year with Grand Rapids, scoring 20 points in 66 games. He was used as an call-up from the Griffins in February to play six games for Detroit in the regular season.

Posting an assist in his Kings' debut against the Carolina Hurricanes on October 17, 2008, he quickly became an important part of a young Kings defensive corps, especially early in the season due to the injury of Jack Johnson, playing on the power play and penalty-killing units. He finished his breakthrough season leading the Kings' defence in scoring, with 34 assists and 38 points in 72 games, before finally succumbing to a herniated disc on April 1, 2009. On July 3, 2009, Quincey was traded, along with defenceman Tom Preissing and a fifth-round pick in 2010, to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for left winger Ryan Smyth. In the 2009–10 season, he made his Avalanche debut on opening night in a 5–2 victory over the San Jose Sharks on October 1, 2009. Quincey joined Todd Gill to become just the second player to play on the Avalanche after previously appearing for the rival Detroit Red Wings. Quincey again quickly established himself within the re-building Avalanche defence to lead the team in average ice time and to record a career-high of six goals for 29 points in 79 games. On July 2, 2010, he was signed by the Avalanche to a two-year contract extension. In July and August 2011, Quincey captained Canada in a three-game exhibition series against the United States in New Zealand.

With the intention to give back to the community, Quincey posted 11 points in 12 games with the Cutthroats before ending his tenure with the team on November 19, 2012. Quincey returned to Detroit when the NHL lock-out ended in January 2013. During the 2013–14 season, Quincey was one of two Red Wings to play in all 82 games, recording four goals and nine assists along the way.

He appeared in 20 games for the club, recording 3 points. On July 1, 2017, having left the Blue Jackets as a free agent, Quincey was signed to a one-year, $1.25 million contract to provide a veteran presence on the blueline with the Minnesota Wild. Quincey began the 2017–18 season, as a third-pairing defenseman for the Wild. After struggling in 18 games, Quincey was placed on waivers by Minnesota on November 29, 2017.

On August 28, 2018, Quincey as a free agent signed his first contract abroad in agreeing to a one-year deal with Finnish club, HIFK of the Liiga. Quincey hails from Orangeville, Ontario, and cites former Toronto Maple Leafs forward Bill Berg as one of his childhood idols. "When I was young, my dad took me to see a Kings game in Toronto. I was watching Wayne Gretzky, but my dad said to me, ‘watch the way Bill Berg plays. Look at him working in the corners, not being afraid to get his nose dirty, and doing all of the little things.’ Berg became one of my favorite players to watch after that because of the effort he put, and how he never took a night off. I feel like I have taken a similar approach to working hard and being confident to do whatever is asked of me." Kyle celebrated his day with the Stanley Cup from the Detroit Red Wings in Caledon, Ontario, with family and friends. He also took the Cup to Alder Street Recreation Centre for autographs and pictures with local fans. Kyle is married to longtime girlfriend Rachel Quincey (Hall).
