Jānis Endzelīns (22 February 1873 – 1 July 1961) was a Latvian linguist. He graduated from the University of Tartu. In 1908, he and Kārlis Mīlenbahs developed the modern Latvian alphabet, which slowly replaced the old orthography used before. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1936. His son was chess master Lūcijs Endzelīns.
