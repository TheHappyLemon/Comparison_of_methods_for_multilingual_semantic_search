Altai City (Mongolian: Алтай хот, romanized: Altai hot, pronounced [aɬˈtʰæˑ χɔʰt]) is the capital of the Govi-Altai province in western Mongolia. As of 2008, its population is 15,800. The Altai Airport (LTI/ZMAT) has one runway and is served by regular flights to Arvaikheer and Ulaanbaatar. Altai City has a typical Mongolian cold semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk) with subarctic (Dwc) influences, although the climate is so dry as to qualify as a cold desert climate (Köppen BWk) despite the annual mean being sufficient for sporadic permafrost. The climate experiences long, very dry and very cold winters with short, mild summers when the majority of the scant precipitation occurs. Wikivoyage has a travel guide for Altai_(Mongolia).
