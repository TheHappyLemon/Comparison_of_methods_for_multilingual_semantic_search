In 1985, Frears had also directed a Comic Strip parody of Daphne Du Maurier's novel Rebecca.

Many critics compared the film to those of Preston Sturges and Frank Capra, as did Roger Ebert, who wrote, "It [the film] has all the ingredients for a terrific entertainment, but it lingers over the kinds of details that belong in a different kind of movie. It comes out of the tradition of those rat-a-tat Preston Sturges comedies of the 1940s." While the film was met with generally positive critical reviews, it was not a box office success. Columbia Pictures lost $25.6 million. Frears has also directed two films adapted from novels by Roddy Doyle, The Snapper (1993) and The Van (1996).
