During the 1980s, Zālīte turned to playwriting, composing librettos for musicals and writing rock operas. Her works have used music by many eminent Latvian artists such as Raimonds Pauls and Jānis Lūsēns. She has earned many literary prizes and national awards, including the Order of the Three Stars, and is considered one of the greatest Latvian social figures. Her first prose work – the autobiographical novel “Five fingers” (2013), earned wide recognition from both readers and members of the writing community. Zālīte was born in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, to where her family had been deported in 1941. She spent 4+1⁄2 years of her childhood in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia until the autumn of 1956 when her parents got the permission to return to their homeland of Latvia. She spent the rest of her childhood in Slampes Kalna Ķivuļi. Zālīte studied elementary and secondary school at Slampes' primary school. Zālīte is a graduate from Murjāņi sports boarding school (1970) and Faculty of Philology of the University of Latvia (1975) (a former State University). Between years 1974 and 1989, Zālīte worked as a technical assistant at the Writers’ Union of Latvia, as a manager of the New Writers’ Studio and as a poetry consultant for the magazine “Liesma”. In 1989, she became chief editor of the publishing house and magazine Karogs, a position she held until 2000, when she became president of the Latvian Authors’ Association (AKKA/LAA) (2000-2008). She has also been a member of the City Council of the Order of the Three Stars (1999-2006), chairman of a State Language Commission (2002–2004) as well as a member of Chapter of Orders (2006-2007).

Cross of Recognition (Atzinības krusts) (12.11.2008) for outstanding merits in social and cultural work, a brilliant creative contribution in Latvian literature and the strengthening of the Latvian language. The International Baltic Sea Region Jānis Baltvilks Prize in Children's Literature and Book Art prize (2012) for the children tale "Tango un Tūtiņa ciemos" (Tango and Tutina on a visit). The Annual Latvian Literary Award (2001; 2004; 2014) for collection of plays "Sauciet to par teātri"; play "Zemes nodoklis" and autobiographical novel "Pieci pirksti" (Five fingers). At the start of Zālīte's career, during the time of her first significant publication of poem “Balādīte” in the magazine Karogs in 1972; the main ideas in her poetry were about life and youth in the 1970s — looking for the meaning of life, development of personality, values, and overcoming the problems of life. Alongside with poetry, Zālīte has written drama. In the 1980s, the writer focused more on the philosophical and emotional motifs combining history and modern times as well as referencing ongoing social and political issues, often associated with Latvian culture and mythology. The tragic Latvian fate and nation's longing for freedom is best depicted in the poetry collection “Debesis, debesis” (1988). Initially, her playwriting developed as a continuation of her poetry. She has written a handful of plays and librettos combining strong individual characters with topics of history, myths and national identity, her most popular one being the libretto for the mythic-symbolic rock opera “The Bearslayer” ("Lāčplēsis") (1987), which became a symbol of the Third Latvian awakening. At the end of the 20th century, Zālīte's 6th poetry collection “Apkārtne” (1997) pictured a person aware of his surroundings and the problems he faces – freedom, chaos, hope, loss and depression. In all of the author's literary career, her works have been strongly influenced by her childhood, which is best depicted in her first prose works – the autobiographical novels “Five fingers” (2013) and “Paradīzes putni”(2018) that talk about occupation and childhood spent in the Soviet Union's regime. Readers describe these works as poetic, nostalgic and passionate. Māra Zālīte has also released some literary works for children. Vakar zaļajā zālē (All Birds Know This).
