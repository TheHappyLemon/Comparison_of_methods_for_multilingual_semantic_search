Russian Empire (Russia) competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, England. It was the second appearance of the European nation, after having missed the 1904 Games. Some sources claim that the Russian shooting team was 13 days late to the Olympics due to the Russian Empire still using the Julian calendar as opposed to the rest of Europe, which used the Gregorian system. Russia had one track & field athlete compete in 1908. Lind took 19th place of 27 finishers in the marathon. "Was Russia really late for the Olympics in 1908? (It won medals anyway!)". www.rbth.com.
