Raspadori is a quick, diminutive, and agile forward, with a low centre of gravity, who is capable of playing as a second striker, as an out-and-out striker or centre-forward, as an attacking midfielder, and even as a winger in a 4–2–3–1 formation. A two-footed player, who possesses good vision and technical skills, he is capable of both creating and scoring goals. He is also known for his ability to provide depth to his team and either exploit or create space with his runs, although he is also capable of dropping deep and linking-up with midfielders. His playing style has drawn comparisons with Antonio Di Natale and Carlos Tevez, although he has cited Sergio Agüero as one of his major inspirations. In October 2021, he was described as "Italy's next centre-forward in the making" by Daniele Verri of BBC Sport. In 2021, he was combining his football career with studying sports science at university.
