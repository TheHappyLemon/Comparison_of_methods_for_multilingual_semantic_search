Arshad Nadeem (Punjabi and Urdu: ارشد ندیم; born January 2, 1997) is a Pakistani javelin thrower. He represents WAPDA in the domestic competition. He is the first Pakistani to qualify for the final of any track and field event at the Olympic Games and the World Athletics Championships. At the 2022 Commonwealth Games, he created a new national and Commonwealth Games record with a throw of 90.18m and became the first ever athlete from South Asia to breach the 90m mark. In 2023, he became the first ever Pakistani athlete to win a medal at the World Athletics Championships, by winning a silver medal . Arshad Nadeem was born into a Punjabi family in Mian Channu, Khanewal, Punjab. He is the third-oldest among eight siblings. Arshad was an exceptionally versatile athlete from his early school years. Though he dabbled in all the sports on offer in his school — cricket, badminton, football and athletics — his passion was cricket and he soon found himself playing it at district-level tape-ball tournaments. Upon entering grade seven in school, Arshad caught the eye of Rasheed Ahmad Saqi during an athletics competition. Saqi had a history of developing sportspeople in the division, and took Arshad under his wing soon afterwards. Before settling on javelin throw, Arshad also pursued shot put and discus throw. Gold medals in javelin throw in successive Punjab Youth Festivals and an inter-board meet propelled him on to the national stage, bringing offers from all the leading domestic athletics teams, including Army, Air Force and WAPDA. It was his father Muhammad Ashraf who persuaded him to take up the sport of javelin throw. Arshad Nadeem started competing in javelin throw events in 2015. In 2016, he received a scholarship from World Athletics which made him eligible to train at the IAAF High Performance Training Centre in Mauritius. In May 2017, Nadeem won a bronze medal with a best throw of 76.33 metres at the Islamic Solidarity Games in Baku. In April 2018, he set a new personal best of 80.45 metres in the qualification round of the javelin throw event at the Commonwealth Games held in Gold Coast, Australia. He also sustained a back injury following the end of 2018 Commonwealth Games. In August 2018, he won a bronze medal at the Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia, where he set a new personal best and national record of 80.75m. As the only Pakistani athlete at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, Nadeem achieved a new personal best and national record of 81.52m. In November 2019, Nadeem set a national record when he recorded an 83.65 metre throw to win gold for WAPDA at the 33rd National Games in Peshawar. In December 2019, he won a gold medal with an 86.29 metre games record throw at the 13th South Asian Games in Nepal. Nadeem made his debut appearance at the Olympics representing Pakistan at the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were held in 2021. In doing so, he became the first ever Pakistani track and field athlete to qualify for the Olympics. His father stated that Nadeem was not even provided with a good training ground facility prior to competing at the Olympics. Nadeem underwent training in his own house's courtyard and streets and is believed to have not received any financial assistance from the Government of Pakistan after qualifying to participate at the Tokyo Olympics. On 4 August 2021, he qualified for the men's javelin throw event final of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. He became the first Pakistani to qualify for the final of any track and field event in the history of Olympics. He finished fifth in the men's javelin throw event with a throw of 84.62 m. From March 2022 until the start of the world championships, Nadeem underwent training in South Africa under the supervision of the world athletic coach Terseus Liebenberg. The training was arranged by the Athletics Federation of Pakistan. In July 2022, Nadeem participated in the 2022 World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, USA, as the sole representative from Pakistan. He finished 5th in the final with a throw of 86.16m. On 7 August 2022, he won a gold medal for Pakistan at the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Despite carrying an injury, Nadeem made a games record with his throw of 90.18m on his fifth attempt, surpassing World Champions Anderson Peters' attempt of 88.64 in the competition, meanwhile also becoming the first South Asian to cross the 90m mark. This was Pakistan's first athletics gold medal at the Commonwealth Games since 1962. Five days later on 12 August 2022, he won another gold medal for Pakistan at the 2021 Islamic Solidarity Games. He made a games record with his throw of 88.55m. Nadeem left for the UK on 1 December 2022 to get treatment on his injured elbow and knee joint. The Athletics Federation of Pakistan arranged for him to be treated at the Spire Cambridge Lea Hospital. After a ten-day rehabilitation and physiotherapy period, full recovery was to take a further four to six weeks. Nadeem participated in the National Games of Pakistan and won a gold medal in the javelin throw event. However, he picked up a knee injury, which ruled him out of the Asian Athletics Championships. Athletics Federation of Pakistan (AFP)’s president Akram Sahi blamed WAPDA for forcing Nadeem to participate in the National Games. Nadeem won a silver medal at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest with a throw of 87.82m. This was Pakistan's first ever medal at the World Athletics Championships. He also secured qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics during the event. Arshad Nadeem is married with two children, a daughter and a son. He is a practicing Muslim.
