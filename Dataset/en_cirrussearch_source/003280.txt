Kara (Korean: 카라; Japanese: カラ; often stylized in all caps) /ˈkɑːrə/ is a South Korean girl group formed by DSP Media in 2007. The group's current lineup is Gyuri, Seungyeon, Nicole, Jiyoung, and Youngji. Kara made their debut in March 2007 with their first studio album, The First Bloooooming, and its title track, "Break It." Originally a quartet composed of Park Gyuri, Han Seungyeon, Nicole Jung, and Kim Sunghee, Kara showcased a strong female image and a mature R&B sound. Expectations for the group were high because they were considered the successors to their senior labelmates, Fin.K.L; however, their debut was a commercial failure. The following year, Sunghee left the group due to parental pressure, and members Goo Hara and Kang Jiyoung were added. After the addition of the new members, Kara's image and musical style changed to a "pretty but natural" concept with the release of their first mini-album, Rock U, in July 2008. Following the change in concept, Kara saw an increase in recognition. In 2009, they achieved their first music show win with "Honey", and after performing their single "Mister," the popularity of its "butt dance" choreography further increased Kara's popularity. Follow-up singles "Lupin" (2010), "Jumping" (2010), "Step" (2011), and "Pandora" (2012), also sold and charted well. After establishing success in Korea, Kara began to promote their music in Japan by signing to Universal Music Japan's subsidiary label, Universal Sigma, in 2010. Following their commercially successful debut, Kara achieved their first number one single in Japan with "Jet Coaster Love" in June 2011, marking the first time a foreign female group topped the singles chart in 30 years. Within their first two years of promoting in Japan, Kara sold over one million physical singles, making them one of the fastest-selling South Korean acts in Japan. In 2014, Nicole and Jiyoung decided not to renew their contracts with DSP Media and left the group. Following their departures, a reality TV show titled Kara Project aired to select a new member to join the group. Seven trainees from DSP Media took part in the program, and the winner, Heo Youngji, became the last member to join Kara. With this four-member lineup, Kara released two more singles in South Korea: "Mamma Mia" (2014) and "Cupid" (2015), receiving one music show win for each. On January 15, 2016, DSP Media announced Kara's disbandment after Gyuri, Seungyeon, and Hara's contracts expired. For Kara's 15th anniversary in 2022, members Gyuri, Seungyeon, Nicole, Jiyoung, and Youngji reunited to release an EP titled Move Again. Its single, "When I Move," earned Kara their first music show win in seven years. The group's name comes from the Greek word "chara" (χαρά, lit. "joy"), which they interpreted to mean "sweet melody". The group started off as a quartet with members Park Gyuri, Han Seung-yeon, Kim Sung-hee, and Jung Nicole. On March 29, 2007, Kara debuted on Mnet's M Countdown with "Break It" from their first album The First Blooming. Their debut song displayed a strong female image and R&B sound. Other singles from the same album were titled "If U Wanna" and "Secret World". Music videos for the first two singles were created. Although their album was acclaimed by critics, it was not well received by the general public and was overshadowed by other girl groups who debuted the same year. All promotions for their first album ended in the summer of 2007. In August 2007, the group came out with a documentary on M.net called Kara Self Camera which showcased the group, their talents, and the relationships they had with each other. The first season debuted on August 8, 2007, and ended on December 12, 2007, with over 15 episodes. In the following months, member Seungyeon continued participating in many television variety shows to keep the group's name recognizable to the public, as their first album was not a commercial success. Comparisons were often drawn between them and their senior labelmates, Fin.K.L, because of their similarities in style and concept as well as the fact that the two groups were signed to the same label. Additionally, each individual member of Kara was paralleled to a member of Fin.K.L. In response to the comparisons, the members of Kara stated that they regarded the comparisons as beneficial and inspiring. The group was scheduled to have their comeback in March 2008 with their second album. However, on February 28, DSP announced that Sunghee would be leaving the group and retire of the entertainment industry. She first announced that her departure from the group was due to her parents pressure to focus on her education after she failed all of her college exams. In response, DSP stated that the second album that was recorded would be shelved and replaced by a mini-album to come in May; in addition, two members would join the group. Auditions were held, and the two new members were eventually revealed to be Goo Ha-ra and Kang Jiyoung. The group made their return in the music industry as a quintet on July 24, 2008, with "Rock U" on M Countdown. Their first mini-album titled Rock U was released the next day. They made their comeback with the "cute" and "playful" image which was the complete opposite of the group's original image from their debut. The second season of Kara Self Camera premiered on August 18, 2008, which chronicled how the group was adapting to their two new members. On November 29, 2008, DSP released a teaser video for their upcoming single, "Pretty Girl", which received over 40,000 hits within 12 hours. The full video was released on December 2, 2008, online and was positively received by the public. The EP, Pretty Girl, was released on December 4, embodying a "fun-party" concept. The group began promoting their comeback on all major music shows on December 4, 2008, starting with M! Countdown. During their first national performance on KBS's Music Bank, member Goo Hara accidentally gasped "ah!" live on air due to slipping on falling confetti, and reportedly cried profusely afterwards. The incident became a hot issue to many viewers, but Goo Hara received comfort instead of criticism from the general public. Park Gyuri attributed their popularity increase to their "pretty but natural" appeal, while media reports gave credit to the band for finally finding its own identity in the music industry since the group's debut and to older male fans, most notably singer Shin Hae Chul. Due to their increasingly hectic schedule as their popularity rose, a few of the group's members were taken to the hospital on December 19 after a Music Bank rehearsal for cold symptoms and exhaustion. At the end of January 2009, DSP announced that it would commence voting on January 28 at the group's official website for the follow-up single to "Pretty Girl", which ended on February 2. By the deadline of February 2, "Honey" was the clear winner, with 60% of the votes. The song was remixed from the original version, and also underwent a slight name change from "하니" (Ha-ni) to "Honey". The group released the music video for "Honey" on February 16 and had their first live broadcasting comeback on KBS's Music Bank program on February 13, 2009; a repackaged mini-album entitled Honey followed on February 19 which featured remixed versions of songs from the group's previous EP. "Honey" became the group's first number one single when it topped Gaon's weekly singles chart. The song earned the group their first music show award on M! Countdown on March 5. It held onto the position for three nonconsecutive weeks.[citation needed] The song also won the Mutizen award on SBS's program Inkigayo and the "Best Dance Award" at the 2009 Mnet Asian Music Awards. At the end of March, the group was chosen for the fourth season of MBC's Idol Show, which marked the group's first hosting duties for a show. The group then had a reality show called MTV Meta Friends, which chronicled a group of fans getting a chance to become friends with the group members. For the show, the group had their first concert since their debut in 2007. In June 2009, the group stated they would make their comeback in late July, with their concept upgraded. The first teaser pictures of the group were then released in mid-July, showing radical changes in the group's style and also saw a slight return of their "strong and mature" image previously seen from their debut. Their single "Wanna" was released on July 28, 2009, and immediately charted on various digital music charts. The music video was released on July 29, with the full album, Revolution, available online on July 30. Comeback activities commenced on July 31, beginning with KBS's Music Bank; the group performed both "Wanna" and "Mister". "Mister" proved to be popular with netizens due to the "butt dance" that is featured prominently in the choreography. Due to the popularity of "Mister", Kara's overall popularity increased, evidenced by an influx of advertisement requests by various companies; in total, they had more advertisements in October 2009 than they had had the previous two years. "Wanna" also became a number one single for the group and won the Mutizen award on August 30, 2009, from Inkigayo. During promotions for Revolution, the group also performed internationally, including at Bangkok's Parc Paragon. On November 25, 2009, M.Net premiered the reality show called Kara Bakery, which followed the group as they attempted to plan, open, and advertise their own bakery. The show had 8 episodes and ran until early 2010. All proceeds from the bakery was donated to charity. On December 14, 2009, it was reported that the group held a fan-meeting for their Japanese fans earlier that year in February marking the group's first promotional tour in Japan. Over 3,000 fans were reportedly registered, exceeding the capacity of the venue which resulted in a second showcase. After a short hiatus, DSP released two teaser photos of the group's comeback concept on February 9, 2010. The photos garnered a lot of interest because compared to their past album concepts, the new photos showed the members in dark outfits and smokey makeup that elicited a darker, more mature, and sexier feel. The next day, the album jacket was unveiled with a "Stealer" concept as well as the title track named "Lupin", which became number one on several online music charts shortly after release.[citation needed] The teaser video was released on February 12 on Naver; the EP, Lupin, followed on February 17.

The song also won the Mutizen award from Inkigayo on March 14.

In April 2010, it was revealed that the group will sing a cheer song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup entitled "We're with You". Behind-the-scenes and individual member teaser videos were revealed along with photos of the group wearing cheerleader outfits. The song was later included on the repackaged version of their second Japanese studio album, Super Girl. The single was released on May 3, 2010. The group also released a single "2ME", the soundtrack for online game We Online. In November 2010, Seungyeon's solo track "Superstar" for KBS's drama Mary Stayed Out All Night was revealed. In 2011, Gyuri and Hara recorded 2 songs for the soundtrack of the SBS's drama City Hunter. "시티헌터" sung by Gyuri was released on June 23 and "I Love U, I Want U, I Need U (Sweet Acoustic Version)" sung by Hara was released on July 27. The group has endorsed online games, clothing, food & beverage, cosmetic products as well as shoes. Kara became endorsers of a cosmetics product, Mistine BB Wonder Compact in Thailand by April 2010. In May 2010, Kara became the female faces of Samsung Doogeun Doogeun Tomorrow Campaign. Kara has also been endorsing for Ask and also for fleece boot company Bear Paws. With the group's successful debut in Japan in August 2010, offers from different electronics, clothing and beverage brands started coming. In October 2010, it was revealed that group has sealed a revenue of 2 billion won from endorsements just 2 months after their Japanese debut. Officials said, "Kara shows a sophisticated image on stage while outside the stage, they show a friendly image" On October 28, 2010, it was confirmed that Kara was chosen as the new models of one of the three biggest Carrier companies in Japan, "KDDI", showing their popularity. Starting on November 1, the group promoted the "Au Santa Letter of Challenge", organized by the "Au Smart Sports Run&Walk", where the group members dressed up in Santa Claus costumes, offering the users gifts with various contents. They also created a "Challenge Live" Twitter account where users posted support messages then 15 pairs people were chosen to attend the Limited Kara Live Event via lottery. Furthermore, with their success in Japan, Japanese game production company Rhaon Japan revealed through their official TalesLand official website that Kara became the new models for their game. Players were able to find group members as characters in the game, and were able to see a short animation of Kara, along with a promotional video on the landing page. In 2010, the group opened their own online clothing franchise called "Karaya", which members Gyuri, Hara and Jiyoung were chosen as spokesmodels. The said online shop proved to be a big hit and rose to 4th place in popularity among celebrity owned internet shopping mall sites. In June 2011, the group was chosen by LG Electronics as the Japanese CF models for their upcoming cellphone brand, LG "Optimus Bright". They also released their Japanese single titled 'Go Go Summer', which was used for the commercial and was promoted at the same time. The commercial and print advertisements were launched on June 17. Moreover, members Park Gyuri, Goo Hara and Kang Jiyoung became the female models for Korean cosmetic brand "Nature Republic". The three members started their exclusive activities with Nature Republic on June 3, 2011. On March 15, 2012, the group announced the release of their own figure dolls created with the "Mister" theme making them the first girl group launch their own toy-brand based upon themselves. The dolls were sold in South Korea and Japan. They were produced by professionals from Hot Toys, DC Comics, Nokia, and Enterbay. This also marked the first time that a doll-based on South Korean idol group has been released because in the past, figures were created for celebrities in Korea, namely actors. On June 18, 2012, the group released their own premium fragrance line called "K5J", an acronym for "Kara 5 Jewel" and members participated in the development of the perfume from the beginning. The fragrance is a special gift for the fans and to bring them even closer together. The perfume was created in Paris in partnership with 3CY, a premium Asian lifestyle brand. The perfume also went on sales at 1,200 offline stores in Japan. On August 29, 2012, DSP revealed that the group has been selected as the ambassadors to bring awareness to K-Food by the MAF and the aT Korea Agro-Fisheries Trade Corporation. Their advertisement campaign was distributed in China, Japan, and as well as Southeast Asia. On January 16, 2012, it was announced that the members of the group will each release their own solo material for their concerts in February. Park Gyuri's song entitled "Daydream", Han Seung-yeon's song entitled "Guilty", Jung Nicole's song entitled "Lost" featuring 2AM's Jinwoon, Goo Ha-ra's song entitled "Secret Love", and Kang Jiyoung's song entitled "Wanna Do" were all performed during their Karasia tour. All the songs were released one by one from August 22 to 26. The teasers for all the videos were released on August 31, 2012. The music videos for "Daydream" and "Secret Love" were released on September 1, 2012. The music videos for "Lost" and "Wanna Do" were released on September 3, 2012. The next day, the music video for "Guilty" was released. The songs were included in their compilation album entitled Kara Collection. In July 2015, Hara became the first member of Kara to make a solo debut with the EP, Alohara (Can You Feel It?). On January 19, 2011, a lawyer representing four of the five Kara members announced to the media that they would be terminating their contract with DSP Entertainment, effective immediately; a lawsuit was also filed on their behalf. Park Gyuri, the leader of the group, was the only one remaining with their management company. In one statement, the lawyer representing the four stated that "the company repeatedly denied any requests and unilaterally forced tasks upon the members", and that they have been preparing for legal action for two months. Later that day, it was announced that Goo Hara would discontinue her involvement with the lawsuit and has rejoined the company, as she apparently was not fully aware of the lawsuit's details. In a statement, DSP Entertainment firmly rebutted all accusations, also stating that they wished to resolve the issues and reconcile with the members quickly. DSP also denied earlier reports of denying Kara members their fair share of profits, stating that each member was paid ₩300,000,000 for their work. The lawyer for the three remaining members released another statement giving further details of their allegations. Their representatives stated that they were misinformed regarding their Japanese promotions, and that their relationship with the company severely deteriorated with the hospitalization of CEO Lee Ho-yeon in March 2010. On April 28, 2011, the dispute between DSP Entertainment and Kara's 3 members (Han Seung-yeon, Nicole Jung, Kang Ji-young) was finally resolved. Current members Gyuri (박규리) (2007–2016, 2022–present) Seungyeon (한승연) (2007–2016, 2022–present) Nicole (정용주) (2007–2014, 2022–present) Jiyoung (강지영) (2008–2014, 2022–present) Youngji (허영지) (2014–2016, 2022–present) Former members Sunghee (김성희) (2007–2008) Hara (구하라) (2008–2016; died 2019) Korean albums The First Bloooooming (2007) Revolution (2009) Step (2011) Full Bloom (2013) Japanese albums Girl's Talk (2010) Super Girl (2011) Girls Forever (2012) Fantastic Girls (2013) Girls Story (2015) Karasia – Includes Kara's first concert tour in 2012, as well as their second, third and fourth tour also titled Karasia in 2013, 2014 and 2015 (2012–15) South Korea portal Pop music portal Music portal Girl group List of best-selling girl groups "김성희, 카라 탈퇴 후 뭐하나 했더니..." 아시아경제 (in Korean).
