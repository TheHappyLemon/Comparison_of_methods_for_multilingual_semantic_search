This is a list of flag bearers who have represented Haiti at the Olympics. Flag bearers carry the national flag of their country at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. Haiti's only athlete in 1936 was weightlifter René A. Ambroise [Wikidata] (from Jacmel), a student based in Paris, where he had taken up the sport. He carried the Haitian flag at the opening ceremony, having discovered that the civil flag of Haiti was identical to that of Liechtenstein. When the latter delegation arrived at the Games, both nations decided to carry different flags in the opening ceremony. Liechtenstein received approval from their government to carry their flag upside-down and add a "Prince's Hat" crown in the corner, while Ambroise added the national crest to his flag (to make it the state flag). As a nation, Liechtenstein then changed its flag in 1937. Haiti at the Olympics Haiti. Olympics at Sport-Reference.com. Sports Reference LLC. Accessed 25 October 2011. "René Ambroise". Olympedia.
