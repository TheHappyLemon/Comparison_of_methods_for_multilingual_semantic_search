The FIBA Women's AmeriCup (formerly FIBA Americas Championship for Women) is the Americas Women's Basketball Championship that take place every two years between national teams of the continents. The Women's AmeriCup is also a qualifying tournament for the FIBA Women's World Cup and the Olympic Games. Since FIBA organized the entire Western Hemisphere west of the Atlantic Ocean under one zone, countries from North America, Central America, the Caribbean and South America compete in this tournament. The U.S. women's basketball team often does not participate in the tournament as it usually qualifies for major tournaments by virtue of winning the World Cup or Olympics.
