The Staël von Holstein family is a Baltic-German Baronial family originating from Westphalia. The family, which originated from ancient Rhenish-German nobility, came to Sweden from Livonia during the 17th century via the Polish Major Hildebrand Staël. The family was naturalized as Swedish Nobility on 14 October 1652, and the family was introduced at the Swedish House of Knights on 20 September 1675. Currently the family has been divided in rank and station: one side of the family was raised to baronial status (Swedish: Friherrelig) in Sweden; another, to baronial level within the Russian Empire in 1869. The family has also been introduced in the Estonian and Latvian Houses of Nobility.
