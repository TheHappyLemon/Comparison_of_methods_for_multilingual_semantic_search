Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+02:00), sometimes referred to as Central European Daylight Time (CEDT), is the standard clock time observed during the period of summer daylight-saving in those European countries which observe Central European Time (CET; UTC+01:00) during the other part of the year. It corresponds to UTC+02:00, which makes it the same as Eastern European Time, Central Africa Time, South African Standard Time, Egypt Standard Time and Kaliningrad Time in Russia. Other names which have been applied to Central European Summer Time are Middle European Summer Time (MEST), Central European Daylight Saving Time (CEDT), and Bravo Time (after the second letter of the NATO phonetic alphabet). Since 1996, European Summer Time has been observed between 01:00 UTC (02:00 CET and 03:00 CEST) on the last Sunday of March, and 01:00 UTC on the last Sunday of October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. There were proposals to abandon summer time in Europe from 2021, possibly by moving winter time up by an hour and keeping that time through the year. The following countries and territories regularly use Central European Summer Time: Albania, since 1974 Andorra, since 1985 Austria, since 1980 Belgium, since 1980 Bosnia and Herzegovina, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia Croatia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia Czech Republic, since 1979 when part of Czechoslovakia Denmark (metropolitan), since 1980 France (metropolitan), since 1976 Germany, since 1980 Gibraltar, since 1982 Hungary, since 1980 Italy, since 1968 Kosovo, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia Liechtenstein, since 1981 Luxembourg, since 1981 Malta, since 1974 Monaco, since 1976 Montenegro, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia Netherlands, since 1977 North Macedonia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia Norway, since 1980 Poland, since 1977 San Marino, since 1966 Serbia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia Slovakia, since 1979 when part of Czechoslovakia Slovenia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia Spain, since 1974 (except Canary Islands, which instead apply Western European Summer Time) Sweden, since 1980 Switzerland, since 1981 Vatican City, since 1966 The following countries have also used Central European Summer Time in the past: Libya, 1951–1959, 1982–1989, 1996–1997, 2012–2013 Lithuania, 1998–1999 Portugal, 1993–1995 Tunisia, 2005–2008 European Summer Time Time zone "Correcting the Domino Daylight Savings Problem". www.nashcom.de.
