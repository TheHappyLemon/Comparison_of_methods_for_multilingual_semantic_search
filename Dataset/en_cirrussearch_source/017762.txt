The next day, they shot 80 male Jews in a forest 5 kilometers west of the town. In the fall of 1941, the Jews were ordered to inhabit an "open ghetto" but in March 1942, this ghetto, by the order of the Gebietskommissar, became an "enclosed ghetto". Altogether, 2 300 Jews resided in the ghetto area.
