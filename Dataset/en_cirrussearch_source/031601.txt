The World Chess Solving Championship (WCSC) is an annual competition in the solving of chess problems (also known as chess puzzles) organized by the World Federation for Chess Composition (WFCC), previously by FIDE via the Permanent Commission of the FIDE for Chess Compositions (PCCC). The participants must solve a series of different types of chess problem in a set amount of time. Points are awarded for correct solutions in the least amount of time. The highest score at the end of the competition is proclaimed the winner. The Tournament consists of six rounds over two days, with three rounds each day according to the following table: Round 1 – 3 twomovers 20 minutes solving time Round 2 – 3 threemovers 60 minutes solving time Round 3 – 3 endgame studies 100 minutes solving time Round 4 – 3 helpmates 50 minutes solving time Round 5 – 3 moremovers 80 minutes solving time Round 6 – 3 selfmates 50 minutes solving time Team Championship – To qualify as an official team world championship, there must be at least seven teams from seven countries present. This section has grown from nine teams in 1977 to now averaging 20. Individual – Likewise, for an official individual world championship to take place, 30 solvers from at least 10 countries must participate. This number too has grown from 18 in 1977 to well over 70 in the past six years (as of 2007). Women and Juniors (up to 23 years old) – This event only requires 10 solvers from at least seven countries. We assume that the tournament has n solvers, with ratings Ri{\displaystyle R_{i}} (i = 1, ..., n) and in the tournament their scores are Si{\displaystyle S_{i}} (i = 1, ..., n). AveRat = average rating of the solvers AveSco = average score of the solvers VarRat = 1n∑i=1n(Ri−AveRat)2{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}(R_{i}-{\mbox{AveRat}})^{2}} Covar = covariance between ratings and scores = (1n∑i=1nRiSi)−AveRat⋅AveSco{\displaystyle ({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}R_{i}S_{i})-{\mbox{AveRat}}\cdot {\mbox{AveSco}}} Slope = CovarVarRat{\displaystyle {\frac {\mbox{Covar}}{\mbox{VarRat}}}} Intercept = AveSco−Slope⋅AveRat{\displaystyle {\mbox{AveSco}}-{\mbox{Slope}}\cdot {\mbox{AveRat}}} For players who didn't already have a rating, a preliminary rating is calculated. This rating is determined at the end of the first tournament in which the solver has participated. The formula that is used to calculate this rating is: preliminary rating = Score of player−InterceptSlope{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mbox{Score of player}}-{\mbox{Intercept}}}{\mbox{Slope}}}} For players who already have a rating, the new rating is calculated as follows. Rat = most recent rating of the solver ExpSco = Slope⋅Rat+Intercept{\displaystyle {\mbox{Slope}}\cdot {\mbox{Rat}}+{\mbox{Intercept}}} TC = tournament coefficient, a number between 1 and 4; when the tournament is stronger, the TC is higher ChangeRat = TC⋅(Score of player−ExpScore){\displaystyle {\mbox{TC}}\cdot ({\mbox{Score of player}}-{\mbox{ExpScore}})} NewRat = new rating = Rat+ChangeRat{\displaystyle {\mbox{Rat}}+{\mbox{ChangeRat}}} These formulas are the defaults. If parameters fall outside a predetermined range, correction calculations are being carried out. These can be found in the reference.
