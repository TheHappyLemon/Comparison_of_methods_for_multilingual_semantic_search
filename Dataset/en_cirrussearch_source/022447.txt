Usvyatsky District (Russian: Усвя́тский райо́н) is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the twenty-four in Pskov Oblast, Russia. It is located in the south of the oblast and borders with Velikoluksky District in the north, Kunyinsky District in the east, Velizhsky District of Smolensk Oblast in the southeast, Vitebsk and Haradok Districts of Belarus in the southwest, and Nevelsky District in the west. The area of the district is 1,100 square kilometers (420 sq mi). Its administrative center is the urban locality (a work settlement) of Usvyaty. Population: 5,598 (2010 Census); 6,360 (2002 Census); 7,905 (1989 Census). The population of Usvyaty accounts for 52.9% of the district's total population. The area of the district is divided between the drainage basins of the Lovat River (which belongs to the Neva River basin) and the Western Dvina River. The Lovat crosses the western part of the district from south to north, flowing from Belarus to Velikoluksky District. The biggest tributary of the Lovat in the limits of the district is the Kunya River (right),which flows to the east and crosses into Kunyinsky District. The central and the southeastern parts of the district belong to the basin of the Usvyacha River, a left tributary of the Western Dvina. The Usvyacha flows to the south, crossing into Belarus. The biggest lakes in the district are Lake Uzmen and Lake Usvyaty, both in the basin of the Usvyacha. The settlement of Usvyaty is located between these two lakes. The Lovat River was a part of the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, one of the oldest trading routes passing through Rus'. This branch of the route followed the Lovat upstream and then the Usvyacha and the Western Dvina. The area was populated since the Middle Ages, and Usvyaty (Vsvyach) was first mentioned in chronicles under 1021. The area was changing hands multiple times between Russia and Poland, eventually went to Poland and stayed there until the First Partition of Poland in 1772, when it was included into newly established Pskov Governorate, a giant administrative unit comprising what is currently Pskov Oblast and a considerable part of Belarus. After 1773, the area was split between Nevelsky and Velizhsky Uyezds of Pskov Governorate. In 1777, it was transferred to Polotsk Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was abolished and the area was transferred to Belarus Governorate; since 1802 to Vitebsk Governorate. Usvyaty was a center of Usvyatskaya Volost of Velizhsky Uyezd. After 1919, Vitebsk Governorate was a part of Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In 1924, Vitebsk Governorate was abolished, and Nevelsky and Velizhsky Uyezds were transferred to Pskov Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Usvyatsky District was established, with the administrative center in the selo of Usvyaty. It included parts of former Nevelsky and Velizhsky Uyezds. Pskov Governorate was abolished as well, and the district became a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On June 17, 1929, Usvyatsky District was transferred to Western Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On September 27, 1937, Western Oblast was abolished, and the district was transferred to Smolensk Oblast. Between 1941 and 1944, Usvyatsky District was occupied by German troops. On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished, and Usvyatsky District was transferred to Pskov Oblast. On October 3, 1959 the district was abolished and merged into Nevelsky District.
