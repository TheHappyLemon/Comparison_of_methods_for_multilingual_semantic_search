Born in Moscow to a Czech father and a British mother, she was younger sister to Vera Menchik, the Women's World Chess Champion. They all moved to England in 1921. In January 1927, Vera won the London ladies championship, and Olga took second place. She took fourth place in the fifth Women's World Chess Championship at Warsaw 1935, and tied for 17–20th in the sixth WWCC at Stockholm 1937 (Vera Menchik won both events). In 1938 she married a British man, Clifford Glanville Rubery.
