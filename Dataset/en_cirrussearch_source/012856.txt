Intelsat 22, is a communications satellite in geostationary orbit and constructed by Boeing Space Systems for the Intelsat Corporation. The satellite was planned to be located at 72° East Longitude over the Indian Ocean. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) signed a US$167 million contract with Intelsat for the UHF payload on the Intelsat 22 satellite for 15 years of service. Intelsat 22 had three distinct communications payloads. A 48 channel C-band payload with 36 MHz channels, a 24 channel Ku-band payload with 36 MHz channels, and an 18 channel Ultra high frequency (UHF) payload with 25 kHz channels. The Intelsat 24 C-band payload consists of 48 operational 36 MHz channels. Two antennas provide service to the Africa and Asia regions. There is some cross connect capability between the two regions. The Intelsat 18 Ku-band payload consists of 24 operational 36 MHz channels with coverage for the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. The UHF payload consists of 18 operational 25 kHz channels which were added to the Intelsat 22 satellite as a result of the contract with ADF (Australia). Intelsat 22 was launched on 25 March 2012 at 12:10:32 UTC. Spaceflight portal "INTELSAT 22 2012-011A 38098". N2YO.com. 28 October 2013. Retrieved 29 October 2013.
