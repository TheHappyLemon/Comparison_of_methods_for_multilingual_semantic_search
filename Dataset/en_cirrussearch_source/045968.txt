David Rundblad (born 8 October 1990) is a Swedish professional ice hockey player who is currently playing with Kärpät in the Liiga. Rundblad was drafted 17th overall by the St. Louis Blues in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. He began his NHL career with the Ottawa Senators before being traded to the Phoenix Coyotes. On 4 March 2014, he was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks. He won the Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks in 2015. Rundblad scored his first Elitserien goal on 14 March 2009, in a playoff game against Linköpings HC. NHL Central Scouting ranked Rundblad sixth among European skaters for the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, one spot behind Skellefteå AIK teammate Tim Erixon. The following season, Rundblad remained with Skellefteå and scored his first regular season goal on 30 January 2010 against Mattias Modig of Luleå HF, a goal that ended up being the game-winner. On 10 June 2010, it was announced that Rundblad had signed an entry-level contract with St. Louis. On 25 June 2010, he was acquired by the Ottawa Senators in exchange for the 16th overall pick in 2010, which the Blues used to select Vladimir Tarasenko. Rundblad finished the 2010–11 season with 50 points in 55 games, the second highest point total of any defenceman in Elitserien history, after David Petrasek, who had 53 points (in 52 games) in 2009–10. Rundblad attended his first Senators camp in 2011, and remained on the roster into the season. Rundblad made his NHL debut on 11 October 2011, against the Minnesota Wild. Rundblad's first NHL point was an assist on a goal by Peter Regin on 15 October in a game against the Washington Capitals. His first NHL goal came on 27 November 2011, against Cam Ward of the Carolina Hurricanes. On 17 December 2011, Rundblad was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes (along with a second-round draft pick) for forward Kyle Turris. Rundblad participated in the AHL All-Star Classic in Providence, Rhode Island, on January 28, 2013. He scored six goals and had 17 assists for 23 points in 32 games before the break. On 4 March 2014, Rundblad (along with defenceman Mathieu Brisebois) was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for a second-round pick in 2014. In 2015, Rundblad won the Stanley Cup with the Chicago Blackhawks, having played in 49 Regular Season games and five Playoff games, including two games in the Stanley Cup Finals. In the 2015–16 season, Rundblad made the Blackhawks opening night roster primarily as the team's reserve defenseman. He provided two assists in nine games before he was placed on waivers and later reassigned to the Rockford IceHogs. Before playing with Rockford, on 3 January 2016, it was announced that Rundblad was loaned to the ZSC Lions of Switzerland's National League A for the remainder of the season. He later returned to the Blackhawks for their post-season run, appearing in three games. On 1 July 2016, Rundblad became a free agent after he was placed on waivers and bought-out from the remaining year of his contract with the Blackhawks. He signed to return to the ZSC Lions of the Swiss top-flight National League A on September 2, 2016. After finishing his ZSC stint, he made the jump to the KHL, signing with SKA Saint Petersburg on 10 May 2017. On 23 June 2022, Rundblad left the KHL following three seasons with Sochi and moved to the Finnish Liiga on a one-year contract with Kärpät.
