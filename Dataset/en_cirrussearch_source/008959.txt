Jelle Vanendert (born 19 February 1985) is a Belgian former professional road racing cyclist, who last rode for UCI ProTeam Bingoal Pauwels Sauces WB. He competed in a total of ten Grand Tours during his career. His younger brother Dennis Vanendert also competed professionally with the Lotto–Soudal team between 2012 and 2015. In 2011, Vanendert showed good form at La Flèche Wallonne, where he came sixth. He rode the Tour de France initially as the main climbing domestique for Jurgen Van den Broeck. However, when his leader crashed out of the race, Vanendert was given a free role, and on Stage 14 attacked from the group of GC contenders to win the stage. Vanendert finished 20th overall and also wore the King of the Mountains Jersey. Vanendert was the leader of Lotto–Belisol in the 2012 Ardennes classics, and finished second in the Amstel Gold Race, fourth in La Flèche Wallonne and tenth in Liège–Bastogne–Liège. In August 2021, Vanendert announced that he would retire from competition at the end of the season. 2004 8th Circuit de Wallonie 2005 4th Flèche Ardennaise 2006 1st Grand Prix de Waregem 1st Stage 2 Ronde de l'Isard 3rd Overall Giro delle Regioni 5th Road race, UCI Under-23 Road World Championships 5th Circuit de Wallonie 7th Road race, UEC European Under-23 Road Championships 7th Grand Prix de Wallonie 10th Druivenkoers Overijse 2007 1st De Vlaamse Pijl 5th Beverbeek Classic 8th Grand Prix de Wallonie 9th Hel van het Mergelland 2009 6th Eschborn–Frankfurt City Loop 9th Overall Tour of Austria 2011 Tour de France 1st Stage 14 Held after Stages 14–19 6th La Flèche Wallonne 9th Clásica de San Sebastián 2012 2nd Amstel Gold Race 4th La Flèche Wallonne 7th Brabantse Pijl 10th Liège–Bastogne–Liège 10th Grote Prijs Jef Scherens 2014 2nd Amstel Gold Race 4th Grand Prix de Wallonie 6th La Flèche Wallonne 6th Clásica de San Sebastián 8th Druivenkoers Overijse 2015 5th Grand Prix de Wallonie 2016 4th Overall Tour de Wallonie 5th Halle–Ingooigem 7th Druivenkoers Overijse 2017 4th Overall Tour de Wallonie 7th Grand Prix de Wallonie 2018 2nd Overall Tour of Belgium 1st Stage 4 3rd La Flèche Wallonne 4th Grand Prix de Wallonie 10th Amstel Gold Race 2019 7th Clásica de San Sebastián 9th La Flèche Wallonne "Lotto Belisol (LTB) – BEL".
