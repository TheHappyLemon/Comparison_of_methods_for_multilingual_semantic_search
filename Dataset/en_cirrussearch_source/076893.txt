There are 69 towns in Slovenia. According to the Local Self-Government Act of the Republic of Slovenia, a town is a larger urban settlement with more than 3,000 residents and differing from other settlements in its size, economical structure, population, population density and historical development. A settlement acquires the status of town through a decision by the Government of Slovenia. Until 2005, the decision was made by the National Assembly of Slovenia. Figures are based on the statistics from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia. T. H.; Barbara Štor (19 January 2021). "Slovenija dobila dve novi mesti, Zreče in Lenart" (in Slovenian).
