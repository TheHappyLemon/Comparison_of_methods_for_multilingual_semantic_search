Progress M-02M (Russian: Прогресс М-02М), identified by NASA as Progress 33P, was a Progress spacecraft which was used to resupply the International Space Station during 2009. It was the second Progress-M 11F615A60 spacecraft, and had the serial number 402. Progress M-02M was launched by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The launch occurred at 18:37 UTC on 7 May 2009. Docking with the Pirs module of the ISS occurred at 19:24 UTC on 12 May 2009. On 30 June 2009, it undocked from the Station to begin a series of scientific experiments, having first been loaded with cargo for disposal, including two Orlan-M spacesuits. It subsequently performed a second rendezvous with the ISS on 12 July 2009 to test docking systems installed for the arrival of Mini-Research Module 2. It approached to a distance of 10–12 metres (33–39 ft) from the zenith port of the Zvezda module, with the closest approach occurring at 17:15 UTC. Following this test, it backed away from the station. At 15:43 UTC on 13 July 2009 it performed its deorbit burn, and it burned up in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean at 16:28:47 UTC.
