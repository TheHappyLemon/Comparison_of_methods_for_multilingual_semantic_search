The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual international song competition, held every year by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) since 1956. This page is a list of people who have acted as presenters of the contest. Since 1988, it has been the norm to have at least two presenters for the contest. All contests before 1978, while only three after 1988 (i.e. the 1993, 1995 and 2013 contests), have had one presenter. The 1999 contest was the first to feature three presenters, a method that has been used most often since 2010. The contests from 2018 to 2021 all had four presenters each. Katie Boyle holds the record for the highest number of contests hosted, with four editions (in 1960, 1963, 1968 and 1974), followed by Petra Mede with two editions (2013 and 2016, and is set to host a third time in 2024) and a special (Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits in 2015).   Contest was cancelled Katie Boyle, born in Florence, Italy to an Italian-Russian father and a British-Australian mother Mireille Delannoy, born in France Helga Guitton, born in Königsberg, East Prussia, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia) Léon Zitrone, born in Petrograd, Russian Empire (now Saint Petersburg, Russia) Lill Lindfors, born in Helsinki, Finland Åse Kleveland, born in Stockholm, Sweden to a Norwegian father and a Swedish mother Viktor Lazlo, born in Lorient, France Fionnuala Sweeney, born in Belfast, United Kingdom Ulrika Jonsson, born in Sollentuna, Sweden Terry Wogan, born in Limerick, Ireland Maria Menounos, born in Medford, Massachusetts, United States to Greek parents Nadia Hasnaoui, born in Morocco to a Moroccan father and a Norwegian mother Anke Engelke, born in Montréal, Quebec, Canada to German parents Katrina Leskanich, born in Topeka, Kansas, United States Graham Norton, born in Clondalkin, Ireland Daniela Ruah, born in Boston, Massachusetts, United States to Portuguese parents Mika, born in Beirut, Lebanon Julia Sanina, born in Kyiv, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union (now Ukraine) Corry Brokken, winner of the 1957 contest for the Netherlands, also represented the country in 1956 and 1958 Yardena Arazi, represented Israel in 1976 as part of Chocolate, Menta, Mastik and 1988 Lill Lindfors, represented Sweden in 1966 alongside Svante Thuresson Åse Kleveland, represented Norway in 1966 Gigliola Cinquetti, winner of the 1964 contest and runner-up of the 1974 contest for Italy Toto Cutugno, winner of the 1990 contest for Italy Dafna Dekel, represented Israel in 1992 Katrina Leskanich, winner of the 1997 contest for the United Kingdom as part of Katrina and the Waves Renārs Kaupers, represented Latvia in 2000 as part of Brainstorm Marie N, winner of the 2002 contest for Latvia Sakis Rouvas, represented Greece in 2004 and 2009 Željko Joksimović, represented Serbia and Montenegro in 2004 alongside the Ad Hoc Orchestra, and Serbia in 2012 Alsou, represented Russia in 2000 Stefan Raab, represented Germany in 2000 Eldar Gasimov, winner of the 2011 contest for Azerbaijan Måns Zelmerlöw, winner of the 2015 contest for Sweden Edsilia Rombley, represented the Netherlands in 1998 and 2007 Chaim Topol (1979) Rene Medvešek and Dubravka Marković [sr] (1990) Alison Doody (1995) Ruslana, winner of the 2004 contest (2005) Yana Churikova (2009) Prior to each year's contest, a series of draws have been held to determine differing facets of the contest's production, which typically are presided over by one or more presenters. Historically, a random drawing of lots was held prior to each year's contest to determine the order in which participating countries would perform in the final, and since 2004 in the semi-finals; this was abolished in 2013, when the running order began to be determined by the contest producers. A semi-final allocation draw has been held since 2008, to determine which countries perform in which of the two semi-finals, as well as in which semi-final the automatic finalists have voting rights. The semi-finalist countries are divided into pots based on historical voting patterns, and countries in each pot are then split equally between the two semi-finals. During this draw, the countries are also assigned to perform in either the first or second half of the show; the exact running order is then determined at a later date. 1960, 1963, 1968 and 1974 hostess: Katie Boyle 1979 hostess: Yardena Arazi 1983 hostess: Marlene Charell 1994 host: Gerry Ryan, pictured in March 2010, one month before his death 2000 hostess: Kattis Ahlström 2003 host: Renārs Kaupers 2006 hostess: Maria Menounos 2007 hosts: Jaana Pelkonen and Mikko Leppilampi 2008 hosts: Jovana Janković and Željko Joksimović 2010 hosts: Nadia Hasnaoui, Erik Solbakken and Haddy Jatou N'jie 2011 hosts: Anke Engelke, Stefan Raab and Judith Rakers 2012 hosts: Leyla Aliyeva, Eldar Gasimov and Nargiz Birk-Petersen 2014 hosts: Nikolaj Koppel, Lise Rønne and Pilou Asbæk 2015 hosts: Alice Tumler, Mirjam Weichselbraun and Arabella Kiesbauer 2016 hosts: Måns Zelmerlöw and Petra Mede 2017 hosts: Timur Miroshnychenko, Oleksandr Skichko and Volodymyr Ostapchuk 2018 hosts: Daniela Ruah, Sílvia Alberto, Catarina Furtado and Filomena Cautela 2019 hosts: Assi Azar, Bar Refaeli, Lucy Ayoub and Erez Tal 2023 hosts: Alesha Dixon, Julia Sanina, Hannah Waddingham and Graham Norton List of Junior Eurovision Song Contest presenters The semi-final allocation draw for the cancelled 2020 contest was retained for the 2021 contest.
