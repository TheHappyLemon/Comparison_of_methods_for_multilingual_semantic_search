Olena Oleksandrivna Kucher-Topolya (Ukrainian: Олена Олександрівна Кучер-Тополя; born 14 May 1986), better known by her stage name Alyosha (Ukrainian: Aльоша), is a Ukrainian singer. Alyosha was born on 14 May 1986 in Zaporizhia. She studied vocals at the Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts and signed with the Catapult Music record label in 2008. On 20 March 2010, Alyosha won the Ukrainian National Final and thus represented Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. She replaced Vasyl Lazarovych, who was originally picked on December 29, 2009, to represent Ukraine. After some political changes that took place in Ukraine his candidacy was withdrawn on March 15 under suspicion that he was picked with the help of the current director of the State National Television (1st National) Vasyl Ilashchuk. The petition to organize another concourse and to cancel the current results was signed by several Ukrainian performers such as Taisia Povaliy, Ruslana Pysanka, and Kostyantyn Meladze. Originally, she was due to participate in the contest with the song "To Be Free". Later on, it came to the light that the winning song has been available for purchase (under the name of Alonya) at Amazon.de since 12 April 2008. This would break the rules of the Eurovision Song Contest. A new song, "Sweet People", was chosen, two days after the 22 March deadline had passed, so NTU was fined by the EBU. Alyosha performed in the second semi-final on 27 May 2010, where she progressed to the final. In the final Alyosha finished 10th with 108 points. During the interval of the first semi final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 in Liverpool, United Kingdom, Alyosha performed a duet of "Ordinary World" alongside Liverpudlian singer Rebecca Ferguson. The contest was hosted by the UK on behalf of Ukraine, who was unable to fulfil its hosting obligations due to the ongoing Russian invasion. Alexandra Matoshko (25 March 2010).
