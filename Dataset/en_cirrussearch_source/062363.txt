The European Pirates (PIRATES) or European Pirate Party (PPEU) is an association of parties aspiring to be recognised as a European political party by the European Union. It was founded on 21 March 2014 at the European Parliament in Brussels in the context of a conference on "European Internet Governance and Beyond", and consists of pirate parties of European countries. The parties cooperated to run a joint campaign for the 2014 European Parliament elections. The founding meeting elected Amelia Andersdotter, Swedish Member of the European Parliament for Piratpartiet, as the first chairperson. The party's members elected to the European Parliament are in The Greens–European Free Alliance. In November 2020, a new board was elected. Mikuláš Peksa was confirmed as a chairperson, Florie Marie (France) and Katla Hólm Vilbergs Þórhildardóttir (Iceland) were elected as chairperson. Alessandro Ciofini (Italy), Lukáš Doležal, Jan Mareš (both Czech Republic) and Mia Utz, Oliver Herzig (both Germany) were elected as ordinary members of the board.
