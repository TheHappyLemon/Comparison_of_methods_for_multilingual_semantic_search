Jakub Piotr Kiwior (born 15 February 2000) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a centre-back or a left-back for Premier League club Arsenal and the Poland national team. Kiwior is a product of the Anderlecht academy. After being unable to break into the first team, he joined FK Železiarne Podbrezová. Kiwior represented Poland at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Kiwior made his Fortuna Liga debut for Železiarne Podbrezová against Nitra on 16 February 2019. Kiwior played the entirety of the 3–1 victory at pod Zoborom. In August 2019, Kiwior's transfer to MŠK Žilina was announced. He made his debut in the yellow jersey on 10 August 2019 during an away fixture against Ružomberok. While Žilina grabbed a three-goal lead in the first half, Ružomberok scored two in the second period and hence Kiwior was brought on to secure the defence, as a replacement for Lukáš Jánošík. Šošoni managed to keep the 3–2 win and remained undefeated in the league. Over a month later, in his second appearance, Kiwior had debuted in the starting-XI against ViOn Zlaté Moravce. While Žilina's defence remained unbeaten, the strikers had failed to score and then match concluded in a goal-less tie. On 9 November Kiwior had recorded his first assist with Žilina. At Štadión pod Dubňom, Žilina was behind Ružomberok by two goals in the second half. Kiwior, a first-half replacement, managed to find Ján Bernát with a pass and narrow the score. Still, Žilina lost 2–1. During the season, he also made sporadic appearances for the reserves competing in 2. Liga. During the coronavirus pandemic, as Žilina had entered liquidation to survive financially and had consequently released 17 players, Kiwior remained unaffected. On 31 August 2021, Kiwior signed for Serie A side Spezia on a four-year deal. He made his debut against Inter Milan on 1 December 2021 as a starter and gave away a penalty after handball that converted into goal by Lautaro Martínez. Kiwior often deployed as defensive midfielder by his former manager Thiago Motta because of his ability to possess and control the ball. On 23 January 2023, Kiwior moved to Arsenal on a long-term contract, making his debut against Sporting on 9 March 2023 in the Europa League last 16 first leg as Arsenal drew 2–2. He made his home and Premier League debut as a substitute in Arsenal's 4–1 win against Crystal Palace on 19 March 2023. He was handed his first start in a 3–1 win over Chelsea in early May after erratic performances from Arsenal back line since William Saliba's injury. He then started in the next game against Newcastle, where a handball decision was overturned. He helped Arsenal have a clean sheet in that match and gained plaudits for his performance. On the final matchday of the 2022–23 season, he scored his first goal for Arsenal in a 5–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 17 May 2022, Kiwior was called up to the Polish senior squad for two 2022–23 UEFA Nations League matches against Belgium and the Netherlands. He debuted on 11 June 2022 against in latter in a 2-2 draw. In November 2022, Kiwior was named in the 26-man squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, starting in all four of Poland's matches during the tournament.[better source needed] On 16 June 2023, Kiwior scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Germany which ended 1–0 for Poland.
