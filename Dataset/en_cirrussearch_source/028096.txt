This armorial of sovereign states shows the coat of arms, national emblem, or seal for every sovereign state. Although some countries do not have an official national emblem, unofficial emblems which are de facto used as national emblems are also shown below. Note that due to copyright restrictions in some countries (including Canada, South Africa, and Qatar), some emblems may not be displayed, or may be displayed with slight alterations in appearance from their official rendition, but nonetheless remain faithful to their heraldic description.

of Africa Armorial of North America Armorial of South America Armorial of Asia Armorial of Europe Armorial of Oceania Gallery of sovereign state flags Although Afghanistan is a member of the United Nations, no other member state officially recognizes its de facto government, the Islamic Emirate. The Islamic Emirate's emblem is therefore displayed on this list alongside the emblem of the UN-recognized government of Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic. France does not have an official national emblem. A diplomatic emblem is commonly used and appears on French passports. An unofficial coat of arms is less commonly used. Never officially adopted but used de facto since 1943 Libya has not had an official coat of arms since the end of the Gaddafi regime in 2011. As of March 2021 the provisional Government of National Unity has adopted the seal shown on this list De facto only, as Turkey currently does not have any official coat of arms, seal or emblem. The crescent moon and star is used on Turkish passports, identity cards, and at diplomatic missions. NGW.nl, Heraldry of the world: International Civic Arms (33,000 arms of countries, states etc.)
