Thorsten Fink (born 29 October 1967) is a German football coach and a former footballer, who is the currently head coach of Belgian Pro League club Sint-Truiden. Fink began his career with Borussia Dortmund's reserve squad before moving to SG Wattenscheid 09, where he helped them gain promotion to the first division of German football, the 1. Bundesliga, in 1990. After the club's relegation in 1994, he moved to Karlsruher SC, where he spent three seasons as a regular and impressed so much that he earned himself a move to the most successful club in Germany, Bayern Munich, in 1997. He subsequently spent seven seasons at Bayern, five of which as a regular, but lost his place in the starting lineup in 2002 and was transferred to the club's reserve squad in the German third division, the Regionalliga, in February 2003, although he managed a return to the Bundesliga squad in late April 2003. In the 2003–04 season, he became a regular in Bayern's reserve squad and only made one, his last, Bundesliga appearance that season, coming on as a substitute against VfL Wolfsburg in September 2003. His contract with Bayern's Bundesliga squad expired in June 2004 and he subsequently only continued to play another two seasons for the club's reserve squad before definitely ending his playing career upon the end of the 2005–06 season. While playing for Bayern's first team, he helped the team reach the 1999 Champions League final against Manchester United, where Bayern dramatically lost 2–1, conceding two goals in injury time. Fink came on as a substitute late in the game, but his sliced clearance in the 91st minute led to United's equaliser, with the ball breaking to Ryan Giggs whose shot was turned into the net by Teddy Sheringham. However, Fink still managed to pick up a Champions League winner's medal two years later, as Bayern beat Valencia in the 2001 Champions League final on penalties, although he did not play in the match. He also won four Bundesliga champions titles and three German Cups with the club. He was forced to end his playing career in 2006 after sustaining cartilage damage in his knee. While still playing for Bayern, he had already graduated from Cologne Sport University, in December 2005, after taking a course on coaching. From 5 September 2006, he began coaching Red Bull Salzburg's reserve side. After the departure of Lothar Matthäus as the assistant of head coach Giovanni Trapattoni, Fink stepped up and became the new assistant. Fink took over as head coach of FC Ingolstadt 04 on 4 January 2008, replacing Jürgen Press, who was sacked on New Year's Day. He appointed Heiko Vogel as his assistant. His first match was a 3–1 win against VfB Stuttgart II. Ingolstadt finished the 2007–08 season in second place. Ingolstadt started the 2008–09 season by losing to Hamburger SV in the first round of the German Cup. Fink was fired on 22 April 2009. He finished with a record of 16 wins, 11 draws, and 17 losses. His final match was a 3–2 loss against SC Freiburg. Ingolstadt were in 17th place when Fink was sacked. On 9 June 2009, Fink was appointed manager of FC Basel as replacement for Christian Gross. Fink took his assistant Vogel with him. His first match was a 2–0 loss to FC St. Gallen on 12 July 2009. In domestic affairs Basel swept the board in 2009/10. Despite a poor start to the season, Finks' side came back to win the 2010 Super League title on the last day of the season with an away win against favourites BSC Young Boys in the Stade de Suisse. Young prospect Valentin Stocker and club legend Scott Chipperfield gave Basel the goals in the 2–0 victory on 16 May. FC Basel won the Swiss Cup Final 2010 with a 6–0 victory over FC Lausanne-Sport on 9 May. Basel started the 2010–11 season against FC Zürich on 20 July. With Fink Basel also won the 2011 Super League title and the 2011 Uhrencup. Fink left the club in October 2011. His final match was a 5–1 win against FC Schötz in the Swiss Cup. Fwayo Tembo left FC Basel after he accused club coach Thorsten Fink of making racist remarks towards him during a training session. Fink is reported to have told a collaborator to "get the monkey down from the tree." On 13 October 2011, Fink signed a contract with Hamburger SV to manage the German Bundesliga club through to 2014. with the team in the relegation zone after losing six of their opening eight matches. His first match was a 1–1 draw against VfL Wolfsburg. In HSV's first nine games under Fink they were unbeaten, going into the winter break in thirteenth place. The team eventually finished fifteenth, avoiding a first ever relegation by five points. In 2012–13, HSV recorded a much improved seventh-place finish. However, during the season Hamburg lost to Karlsruher SC in the first round of the German Cup. the team equaled the club's record Bundesliga defeat, losing 9–2 at the Allianz Arena to FC Bayern Munich. Following a run of disastrous results during which Hamburger SV picked up only four points from their first five league games of the 2013–14 Bundesliga season and with the club in 15th place in the league table, Fink was sacked with immediate effect on 16 September 2013. "We were no longer confident that Thorsten Fink was capable of turning the team around and that was why we took this decision (to sack Fink). Also it is apparent that he had 'outside troubles' which could have contributed to his poor results. His final match was a 6–2 loss to Borussia Dortmund. He finished with a record of 23 wins, 18 draws, and 27 losses in 68 matches. On 10 January 2015, Fink signed a contract until the end of the 2014–15 season, with the option of a further season with the reigning Cypriot champions APOEL FC, replacing Giorgos Donis who was fired on 6 January 2015. His first match was a 2–1 loss to AEL Limassol. Following a run of disappointing performances and one day after a questionable 1–0 loss to Apollon Limassol, Fink was sacked by APOEL on 11 May 2015, although at that moment the team were two points clear at the top of the league with only two matches remaining. Fink was hired as Austria Wien's head coach on 28 May 2015. He was given a two-year contract plus an option and started in the 2015–16 season. He was also in negotiations with Hannover 96.
