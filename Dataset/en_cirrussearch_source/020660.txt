Shirreff Base (original name Cape Shirreff Field Station) is a seasonal field station in the Southern Ocean operated by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and opened in 1996. It is situated on the east side of Cape Shirreff on Ioannes Paulus II Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands off the Antarctic peninsula. In January 2023 as the station was being rebuilt, it was renamed the Holt Watters Field Camp recognizing directors Rennie Holt and George Watters of NOAA's Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division (AERD). It is adjacent to the Chilean base called Doctor Guillermo Mann. The base is located 1.58 km southeast of Cape Shirreff and 3.32 km west-northwest of Black Point (detailed Chilean mapping in 2004. Bulgarian mapping in 2005 and 2009). L.L.
