Ünal was born in Osmangazi in Bursa, and was promoted from the Bursaspor youth team.

On 25 August 2013, Ünal came off the bench for Ferhat Kiraz in the 71st minute to make his debut against Galatasaray, and scored his first league goal three minutes later with the assist by Pablo Batalla.

In the Cherries' following match against Luton Town, Ünal set up Antoine Semenyo's winning goal as Bournemouth came from 0–3 down to win 4–3. In doing so, they became only the fifth team in Premier League history to overturn a 3–0 deficit.
