"Acceptable in the 80s" is a song by Scottish producer, songwriter and DJ Calvin Harris, taken from his debut studio album I Created Disco. It was released as his debut single on 12 March 2007. The single peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. The song has also served as the opening theme of Irish professional wrestling podcast OSW Review since its 2011 inception. The music video, directed by Woof Wan-Bau, features many references to the 1980s, including the stereotypical large hairstyles and bright dayglo colours. It also features scientists dissecting a sock puppet of what appears to be a genet, the products of which are used by a hair stylist and a TV chef, and to heal a grazed knee. A remix of the song with additional lyrics (retitled "Love for You"), was included as a B-side to the single.[citation needed] Duran Duran partially covered the song during their 2021–2023 live dates, mixing the song's chorus with the group's own 1981 single "Girls on Film".[citation needed] In 2022, UK comedy hip-hop group The Northern Boys sampled the song for their single "Nobody Likes Me". Acts such as The Airport District, Pittsburgh Slim and Out Of The Blue have also sampled the song. "New Releases: Singles". Music Week. 10 March 2007. p. 29. Naylor, Tony (13 June 2007).
