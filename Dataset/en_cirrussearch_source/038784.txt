Roberts Uldriķis (born 3 April 1998) is a Latvian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Eerste Divisie club Cambuur, which he captains, and the Latvia national team. Uldriķis started playing football for JDFS Alberts and Skonto's academy before making a move to Latvian Higher League club Metta/Latvijas Universitāte in January 2015. He made his professional debut on 12 April 2015 in a game against his former side Skonto. By the close of the season, he had made 15 appearances in the top division, finding the net once. During the subsequent 2016 season, he featured in 22 league matches, showcasing his prowess by scoring six goals. He was also voted Young Player of the Round twice during the season. In 2017, he moved to league rivals RFS, where he played 25 matches and scored five goals by season's end. The following year, he continued to impress, participating in ten games and netting seven times. In July 2018, Uldriķis signed with Swiss Super League club FC Sion. He made his debut for the club on 22 July 2018 in a 2–1 loss against FC Lugano, entering the pitch as a substitute for Carlitos in the 64th minute. Throughout the season, he featured in 21 league matches for Sion, contributing with four goals. Additionally, he made two appearances for the reserve team in the third-tier Swiss Promotion League. In the subsequent 2019–20 season, Uldriķis continued to make his mark in the highest Swiss league, participating in 24 matches and scoring four goals. This persisted into the 2020–21 season, where he once again played 24 league matches and found the net three times. The club's league season ended in a ninth place finish, and having to go through relegation playoffs against FC Thun. Following a two-legged tie, Sion emerged victorious with a 6–4 aggregate score, securing their top-tier status. Uldriķis notably contributed by appearing as a substitute in both legs and scoring a crucial goal for a 4–0 lead in the first leg. Uldriķis joined recently promoted Dutch Eredivisie club Cambuur on 31 August 2021. Injured at the start of the season, he made his debut for the club on 3 October 2021, replacing Tom Boere in the 62nd minute and scoring his first goal ten minutes later in a 3–1 victory against AZ. In his first season at the club, he distinguished himself as the top scorer for the club with seven goals in 21 league matches. However, his second season saw a decline in goal-scoring output, managing only one goal in 28 appearances. Unfortunately, this downturn coincided with the team's relegation to the second-tier Eerste Divisie in the summer of 2023. Uldriķis made his Latvia national team debut on 12 June 2017 in a friendly game against rivals Estonia. He scored his first goal for Latvia on 9 June 2018 in a friendly against Azerbaijan.
