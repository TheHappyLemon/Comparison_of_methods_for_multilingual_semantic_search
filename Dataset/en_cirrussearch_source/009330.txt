Azerbaijan is administratively divided into 69 districts (rayon) and 11 cities (şəhər) that are subordinate to the Republic. Out of these, 7 districts and 1 city are located within the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The districts are further divided into municipalities (bələdiyyə). Additionally, the districts of Azerbaijan are grouped into 14 Economic Regions (İqtisadi Rayon). On 7 July 2021, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed Decree "On the new division of economic regions in the Republic of Azerbaijan". The list below represents mainland Azerbaijan and excludes the districts of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic: Note: (a) including an estimated 148,795 for Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh) estimated for 2019 by the Artsakh Statistical Service. The seven districts and one municipality of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic are listed below. The territory of former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast presently consists of the districts of Khojavend, Shusha, Khojaly, the eastern portion of Kalbajar and the western portion of Tartar. The Autonomous Oblast was abolished on 26 November 1991, by the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR. Since then, the territory of the autonomous oblast has been administratively split between the aforementioned districts. As a result of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, most of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding districts came under the occupation of ethnic Armenian forces. The self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh also controlled a large part of southwestern Azerbaijan outside Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan regained control of all of the surrounding districts and large parts of Nagorno-Karabakh following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. Azerbaijan regained control of all of Nagorno-Karabakh following 2023 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes.
