Kalynivka (Ukrainian: Калинівка; Polish: Kalinówka; Russian: Калиновка) is a town in Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine. Kalynivka served as the administrative center of the former Kalynivka Raion until 2020. It has a population of 18,492 (2022 estimate). The Jewish population was important in the town. During World War II, the Germans occupied the town and kept the Jews prisoners in a ghetto. In May 1942, hundreds of Jews were murdered in mass executions perpetrated by an Einsatzgruppe. On 26 September 2017, at about 10:00 pm (19:00 UTC), the munitions depot for the Ukrainian Army, just south of the town, blew up causing extensive damage to nearby houses and other buildings. This was implied (if not claimed) to be Russian "sabotage" by Ukrainian authorities, including President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman. In September 2021 the general prosecutor announced that evidence confirmed sabotage.
