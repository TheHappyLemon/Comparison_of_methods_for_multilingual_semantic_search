During his junior season, Gill led the Cavaliers in rebounding with 6.5 rebounds per game and ranked third in scoring with 11.6 points per game. Following the season, he was named third-team All-ACC and voted onto the coaches' All-ACC Defensive Team. After going undrafted in the 2016 NBA draft, Gill signed with MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg in Germany. However, he left the team prior to the season's start after failing a medical exam on August 23, 2016. Gill then signed with Yeşilgiresun Belediye of the Basketbol Süper Ligi. On June 24, 2017, Gill signed a contract to play for the Charlotte Hornets during the 2017 NBA Summer League.
