There are several fish ponds in the municipal territory, supplied by brooks that flows into the Sázava. The first written mention of Přibyslav is from 1257. Until the Hussite Wars, it was a small mining town known for silver mining. After the wars, the mining was never successfully renewed. During the Hussite Wars, Přibyslav was a military base of the Hussites. The town was often severely affected by wars and by frequent fires, which destroyed many historically valuable buildings. The most devastating fire occurred in 1767. The largest employer based in the town is ACO Industries, a manufacturer of drainage systems. It employs more than 500 people. Přibyslav lies on an important railway line heading from Prague to Brno. The oldest building in the town is a Gothic tower from 1497. The adjacent baroque Church of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist is from 1753. Přibyslav Castle was built in 1560 by Zachariáš of Hradec. There are two courtyards in the castle. The older one is valuable by columns in the Tuscan style. Today the castle houses the Fireman Museum. An equestrian statue of Jan Žižka by Bohumil Kafka from 1935 is located in the town park. It is a smaller model of the larger statue, which is part of the National Monument at Vítkov in Prague.
