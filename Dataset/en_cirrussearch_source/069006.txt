Alongside Tony Manero and Post Mortem, No has been considered a part of an "unintentional trilogy" by Larraín, with all three films being centered around stories set during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. Larraín has said, "In Chile, the right, as part of the Pinochet government, is directly responsible for what happened to culture during those years, not only by destroying it or restricting its spread, but also through its persecution of writers and artists." He stated that "Chile found itself unable to express itself artistically for nearly twenty years" and also felt that "the right wing throughout the world is not very interested in culture and this reveals the ignorance that is probably theirs, because it is difficult for someone to make the most of something or to enjoy it if you have no knowledge of it".

On 24 March 2014, The Wrap reported that Larraín was in negotiations to direct a new film version of Scarface for Universal Studios, with Paul Attanasio writing the script.
