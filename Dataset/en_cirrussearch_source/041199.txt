The town is situated on the left bank of the Jizera River, which forms the western municipal border. The streams Veselka and Nedbalka, tributaries of the Jizera, flows through the town. The first written mention of Mnichovo Hradiště is from 1279. It was founded by monks from the nearby Cistercian monastery in Klášter Hradiště nad Jizerou. The town was named the same as the monastery, Hradiště (meaning "gord"). From the 19th century, the town is called Mnichovo Hradiště ("Monk's Gord"). Until 1918, Münchengrätz – Mnichovo Hradiště was part of Austria-Hungary, in the district with the same name, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia. In 2010, a factory producing the Czech cola-based drink Kofola opened in Mnichovo Hradiště. The D10 motorway from Prague to Turnov runs next to the town. The main landmark of the town is Mnichovo Hradiště Castle. The original Gothic fortress was rebuilt into a Renaissance residence in 1606 by Václav Budovec of Budov. In 1621, it was acquired by Albrecht von Wallenstein. His family, the Waldstein family, owned the castle until 1945. In 1945, it was confiscated by the state. Today the castle is still owned by the state and is open to the public. It is protected as a national cultural monument. The castle is connected to the baroque complex of the Capuchin monastery from the 1690s, founded by the Waldsteins. The complex include the Church of the Holy Three Kings, the convent and the burial chapel of the Waldsteins. The remains of Albrecht von Wallenstein were moved from Jičín to the chapel in 1723.
