.ng is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Nigeria. It is overseen by the Nigeria Internet Registration Association (NIRA). The top-level domain was first delegated in 1995 to Ibukun Odusote at the Yaba College of Technology. She was made a life patron of the Nigeria Internet Registration Association in 2013 for her work. Operations were initially handled by an organization in Italy, the Instituto per le Applicazioni Telematiche (today known as the Istituto di Informatica e Telematica [it]), but were later transferred to Randy Bush. In 2004, .ng was re-delegated in 2004 to a Nigerian organization, the National Information Technology Development Agency, and then in 2009, re-delegated to the Nigeria Internet Registration Association. com.ng – open domain, commercial entities and businesses org.ng – semi-open domain, non-commercial organizations gov.ng – closed domain, governmental organizations edu.ng – closed domain, degree awarding institutions net.ng – closed domain, ISP infrastructure sch.ng – closed domain, secondary schools name.ng – open domain, individuals mobi.ng – open domain, suitable for mobile devices mil.ng – closed domain (Nigerian military establishments only) i.ng – open domain, any purpose In addition, NIRA themselves reserve the right to register 'premium' top level domains under .ng (for example, "google.ng").
