The 2017 Paris–Roubaix was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 9 April 2017. It was the 115th edition of the Paris–Roubaix and was the fifteenth event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. It was won by Greg Van Avermaet (BMC Racing Team) in a five-man sprint – for his first Monument classic victory – ahead of Quick-Step Floors rider Zdeněk Štybar and Sebastian Langeveld of Cannondale–Drapac. The average speed of 45.2 km/h was a record. As Paris-Roubaix is a UCI World Tour event, all 18 UCI World Teams were invited automatically and were obliged to send a squad. In February 2017, the race organisers announced the seven UCI Professional Continental teams that had received wildcard invitations, completing the 25-team peloton.
