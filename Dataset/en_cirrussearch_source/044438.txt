It is an international co-production between Belgium, France and Italy. The film had its world premiere at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival where it competed for the Palme d'Or. The film and Cotillard's performance received generally positive reviews. It grossed $9 million worldwide on a €7 million budget, becoming the Dardenne brothers' highest-grossing film. It won the Sydney Film Prize at the 2014 Sydney Film Festival, was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language, nominated for two César Awards, nominated for three European Film Awards, winning Best Actress for Cotillard, and for nine Magritte Awards, winning three, including Best Film and Best Director for Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne. Cotillard also won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. The film was selected as Belgium's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, but was not nominated, though Cotillard received a Best Actress nomination for her performance in the film, making her the first actor to be nominated for a Belgian film. In Seraing, an industrial town near Liège, Belgium, young wife and mother Sandra prepares to return to work at Solwal, a small solar-panel factory, after a medical leave of absence for depression and anxiety. During her absence, Solwal management realises her colleagues are able to cover her shifts by working slightly longer hours and proposes a €1,000 bonus to each if they agree to make Sandra redundant. On Friday evening, after Sandra hears the news and that only two of the 16 voted for her to stay, she breaks down, feeling hopeless and worthless. Her husband, Manu, tries to lift her spirits. A co-worker friend Juliette, who voted on her behalf, convinces her to talk to M. Dumont, the Solwal manager. Sandra is too petrified to speak, but Juliette argues her case. Juliette tells him some of the workers felt pressured to vote against Sandra by the factory foreman Jean-Marc, who insinuated one job must be eliminated. Though hesitant, Dumont agrees to a second, secret ballot early Monday. Realising that her fate rests in the hands of her co-workers, Sandra must visit each of the 14 over the course of the weekend to persuade them to reject the monetary bonus, and she faces an uphill battle to keep her job before the crucial vote on Monday. Most of her co-workers are counting on the bonus for their own families. Some of her co-workers are immigrants and some are already working second jobs to get by; most react with sympathy, but a few with anger. Sandra is crushed when a co-worker she considered a friend pretends not to be home, but is heartened by the few who support her and say they will vote for her. Timur, an immigrant from Dagestan, breaks down in tears and says he is ashamed of himself, as Sandra covered for him when he broke a panel on his first day. He says he will change his mind and talk to another worker on her behalf. On Sunday afternoon, Sandra discovers that Jean-Marc has been calling their co-workers to convince them not to change their votes, and that in reality he is against Sandra coming back because of her depression. She visits her co-worker Anne, whose husband rudely throws her out and screams at both women. Dejected, Sandra attempts suicide at home by overdosing on Xanax, but when Anne arrives to tell her she will vote for her, Sandra confesses to Manu, who forces her to vomit the pills up. Sandra recovers at the hospital and is touched when she finds out Anne came to the hospital too. Sandra tells Manu they will visit the remaining three that evening. When Anne tells her she has decided to leave her husband, Sandra invites her to their house to spend the night. Sandra speaks to Alphonse, a young African immigrant who is working as a welder on contract. He will only get €150 because he is new, but he is afraid of Jean-Marc, who told him to vote against Sandra if he wants to get along with his co-workers. Alphonse tells her he wants to vote for her, but he's afraid Jean-Marc will find out and write him up for his mistakes, which could damage his chance of renewing his contract when it expires in September. On Monday morning, as the Solwal workers vote again, Jean-Marc reacts angrily to Sandra. She stands up for herself and reminds him that he acted unfairly. In the second ballot, eight vote for her to keep the job, and eight vote to keep the bonus – not enough to overturn Friday's vote. She tearfully thanks those who voted for her, including Alphonse. She tells Anne she can stay at their house again that night and stoically clears out her locker. However, Dumont calls her into his office and congratulates her on convincing so many to support her. He tells her he has decided to give everyone the bonus but still keep her on. Sandra's joy is short lived as he explains he will simply not renew a worker whose contract expires in September – Alphonse. Sandra politely declines his offer – she now has the confidence to start anew, and pursue a new life for herself. "We put up a good fight," she tells Manu proudly.

Dumont, manager at Solwal Serge Koto as Alphonse, welder at Solwal On 25 February 2013, The Film Stage announced that Marion Cotillard would star in the Dardenne brothers' next film, Two Days, One Night, and that Fabrizio Rongione, who had previously worked with the Dardenne brothers in Rosetta (1999), L'Enfant (2005), Lorna's Silence (2008), and The Kid with a Bike (2011), would have a supporting role as the husband of Cotillard's character in the film. Cotillard is the most famous actor the Dardenne brothers have worked with, and the first French actor they cast as the lead in one of their films, which usually have relatively unknown Belgian actors in the cast. Jean-Pierre Dardenne said about that choice; "hiring such a famous actress was an additional challenge for us. Marion was able to find a new body and a new face for this film." One of the Dardenne brothers' first requests for Cotillard was for her to lose her French Parisian accent, in order for her character to sound as an authentic Belgian. Cotillard said she was very happy when the Dardennes praised her Liège accent. The Dardenne brothers were co-producers on Jacques Audiard's 2012 romantic drama film Rust and Bone, which Cotillard had starred in, and they met the actress by chance on that film's set in Belgium when she was coming out of an elevator holding her baby. They said they were won over immediately. "Driving back to Liège, we didn't stop talking about her: her face, her look…", said Luc Dardenne, who also called their first encounter with Cotillard a "cinematic love at first sight". The brothers then told Cotillard about a project they were writing about a young doctor and that they would love to work with her, and she said the same to them. Initially, the Dardenne brothers had a different project in mind in which Cotilard would play a doctor, but that script did not come together because they had writer's block, so they decided to write a different film for her, which was originally a project they had begun about ten years before but left behind. They started writing the script for Two Days, One Night in October 2012 and finished in March 2013. The script was based on a story the Dardenne brothers read in a sociology book about a worker at Peugeot in France in 1998, who was fired after his boss incited his team to vote for his dismissal because he was preventing them from getting bigger bonuses. Luc Dardenne said he and his brother were also thinking of Sidney Lumet's 1957 courtroom drama film 12 Angry Men, "because it's a process of going to see people to try and change their minds", he said. The film was a Belgian production with French and Italian co-producers. It was produced by Dardenne's Les Films du Fleuve with co-production support from France's Archipel 35, Italy's BIM Distribuzione and Belgium's Eyeworks Film & TV Drama. It received funding from the Flemish Audiovisual Fund, RTBF and Centre du cinéma et de l'audiovisuel. It received 500,000 euros from Eurimages. The total budget was seven million euros. The rehearsal process lasted six weeks. Filming began in late June 2013 in Seraing, Belgium and was wrapped in September 2013. The film was shot in chronological order. The Dardenne brothers required several takes for the long sequence shots. They did 56 takes for a single sequence on the second day of filming, and on the fourth day they did 82 takes. Cotillard said that she even asked for more takes herself, and that sometimes it went up to 95 or 100 takes. Two Days, One Night premiered at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival on 20 May 2014. The film was released in France on 21 May 2014 through Diaphana, and in Belgium on the same day through Cinéart. It was screened at the Sydney Film Festival on 9 June 2014 and at the Munich Film Festival on 29 June 2014. It was the closing film of the Norwegian Film Festival on 20 August 2014.

It was the opening film of Valladolid Film Festival on 18 October 2014 and was screened at the Savannah Film Festival on 28 October 2014. and at AFI Fest on 7 November 2014.

The film has an approval of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 185 reviews with an average rating of 8.4/10.

Empire gave the film five out of five stars and described it as "a rare film of unforced simplicity, with an outstanding lead performance". Empire also chose Two Days, One Night as one of the 50 best films of 2014, ranked at number 44.The Hollywood Reporter praised the film and stated that it stands alongside Marion Cotillard's best work. The film won the Sydney Film Prize at Sydney Film Festival "For its masterfully elegant storytelling, its dedication to a fiercely humanistic, super-realist worldview, its brave, essential commitment to community solidarity, and its celebration of a woman's power and vitality," said Jury President Rachel Perkins. Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw gave the film 5 stars, praising in particular Cotillard's "supremely intelligent performance." Nicholas Barber of BBC gave the film four stars, praising Cotillard's performance saying that "she conveys a tremendous amount with the smallest, quietest gestures. When you see the fierce, tearful grin on her face after one successful encounter, and the sleepwalking shuffle she adopts when her depression threatens to engulf her, it’s plain that she is one of the finest cinema actors we have." Emma Dibdin of Digital Spy gave the film four stars, calling Cotillard "fascinating to watch" and said that "The physical sluggishness and emotional numbing of depression have seldom been better portrayed on screen, and yet Two Days One Night still emerges as a psychologically delving and quietly uplifting modern-day morality play." The National Board of Review chose the film as one of the Top 5 Foreign Films of 2014. Time magazine ranked Cotillard's performance in the film as the fourth best performance of 2014, shared with her performance in The Immigrant. In Spain, filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar made a list of the best films and performances of 2014, and included Cotillard's performance on his list of best foreign actresses.
