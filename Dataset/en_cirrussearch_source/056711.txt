62°07′N 7°05′W﻿ / ﻿62.11°N 7.08°W﻿ / 62.11; -7.08 The Vágatunnilin (Vágar Tunnel) is a 4,940 metres (16,210 ft) long undersea road tunnel in the Faroe Islands. It goes under Vestmannasund strait and connects the two islands of Streymoy and Vágar. The tunnel was the first sub-sea tunnel in the Faroe Islands, and connects the capital of Tórshavn on Streymoy with Vágar Airport on Vágar. Surveyor drills were executed in 1988, and construction was planned to start in 1989. However, due to the onset of the economic crisis, almost all infrastructural projects were suspended, including the Vágatunnilin. Only the construction of Gamlarætt, a new ferry port to Sandoy, continued. After the false start, the second attempt for construction started on 28 September 2000. The opening for public traffic was 10 December 2002. Traffic has steadily increased from 359,440 vehicles in 2003 to 952,300 in 2019 (2,609 per day). Before the opening date there was a ferry across the Vestmannasund between Vestmanna and Oyrargjógv operated by Strandfaraskip Landsins. Both ferry docks are now in disuse. It has a two-lane 7 metres (23 ft) wide road. The deepest point is 105 metres (344 ft) below sea level. There is a road toll which is used to pay the maintenance for the tunnel construction. The investment of 240 million Danish kroner was paid back at 10 December 2016, exactly 14 years after opening.
