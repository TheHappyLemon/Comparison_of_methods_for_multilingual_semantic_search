Born in Neubrandenburg, Bezirk Neubrandenburg, East Germany, Borowski started his career at hometown club 1. FC Neubrandenburg 04, where he was spotted by SV Werder Bremen and signed at the age of 16 for its junior teams. He spent two full seasons with the reserves, competing mainly in Regionalliga Nord. Borowski made his official debut for Werder on 26 August 2000, starting in a 0–1 home loss against VfL Wolfsburg for the DFB-Pokal. He was definitely promoted to the main squad early into the following campaign. Borowski contributed with 25 games and one goal (against FC Schalke 04 in a 4–1 home win) in 2003–04 as the Hanseatic won their fourth national championship, the first in 11 years. He added career highs of ten goals and 11 assists in the 2005–06 season, helping his team to a final second position; in the latter campaign's UEFA Champions League he also scored against Juventus F.C. for a 3–2 round-of-16 first leg home win, in an eventual away goals rule exit. Borowski joined FC Bayern Munich in the 2008 summer after the move was made effective in January, in a free transfer. He finished his first and only season with 30 appearances all competitions comprised. In this season, he appeared in the Champions League seven times and scored there once, he scored in the DFB-Pokal too, and in the Bundesliga five times. In the Bundesliga, he managed to establish himself in the starting eleven six times, in the DFB-Pokal twice, and in the Champions League also twice. Borowski returned to Werder Bremen on 22 July 2009, signing a three-year contract. After featuring in only 13 league matches in his last two years combined he was released by his main club, and retired from football shortly after due to injury, aged 32. In the summer of 2014, Borowski completed his 18-month traineeship in the marketing department which he had been going through since January 2013 at Werder Bremen. In April of the following year, he signed a contract until July 2018 as sports director for the reserve team.

He started in the following match against Italy, leaving injured in an eventual 0–2 loss. Borowski also participated at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup (three minutes against Brazil in the semi-finals) and UEFA Euro 2008 (two substitute appearances for the runners-up).
