Naval (IPA: [nɐ'val]), officially the Municipality of Naval (Waray: Bungto han Naval; Cebuano: Lungsod sa Naval; Tagalog: Bayan ng Naval), is a 2nd class municipality and capital of the province of Biliran, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 58,187 people. The town of Naval was once named Bagazumbol, which was perceived by natives as being too warlike a description. The aboriginal name was later modified in 1859 to a more peaceful[neutrality is disputed] name—the presently known Naval. On May 26, 1860, Naval was separated from Biliran, but it became an independent parish only in September later that year. The following year, on July 31, 1861, Romualdo Ximeno, Bishop of Cebu, officially declared Naval an independent parish. In August 1861, Father Santos de Santa Juana took up formal residence as the first parish priest of Naval and served the town for twenty-one years until 1882. On September 26, 1869, Naval was officially established and recognized as an independent pueblo. In 1957, the barrio of Higatangan was abolished, and its sitios of Libertad and Mabini were converted into barrios. As of today, Naval pushes itself on its way to cityhood. House Bill No. 6230 was filed last February 10, 2020 for the conversion of the municipality of Naval into a component city in the province of Biliran. The bill is currently pending with the committee on local government since February 12, 2020. In the 19th Congress of the Philippines, house bills were filed by various representatives which seeks Naval including other capital towns of provinces with no current component cities, independent component cities or highly urbanized cities to automatically convert into cities.
