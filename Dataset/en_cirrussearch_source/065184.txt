Slavyansk-on-Kuban (Russian: –°–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫-–Ω–∞-–ö—É–±–∞–Ω–∏, romanized:¬†Slavyansk-na-Kubani) is a town in Krasnodar Krai, Russia, located in the Kuban River delta. Population: 63,842‚Äâ(2010 Census); 64,136‚Äâ(2002 Census); 57,790‚Äâ(1989 Census); 56,000 (1975). Slavyansk originated in the Middle Ages as Copa or Coparia, a Genoese trade outpost controlled by the Ghisolfi family and was one of the most important Genoese colonies in the Black Sea area. After the fall of the Genoese power in the Pontic region, the site was abandoned until 1747 when the Crimean Khanate erected a small fort, known in Russian sources as Kopyl. After the conquest of the Taman Peninsula by the Russian Empire, the Tatar fort gave way to the Cossack stanitsa of Kopylskaya. In 1865, it was renamed after the Slavyansky regiment that had been quartered there under Catherine the Great. In 1958, it was incorporated as the town of Slavyansk-na-Kubani (so called in order to distinguish it from the eponymous city in Ukraine).[citation needed]. The history of Slavyansk dates backs to the end of the 18th century. This town was a fortress founded by General Suvorov to defend the southern borders of Russia. In 1865 the fortress became a Cossack stanitsa. During World War II this town was occupied by the Germans in 1942-3 and it was re-occupied by The Red Army in 1943. The town features monuments to those who were lost in the war. The city was the administrative center of the Tamansky Otdel of the Kuban Oblast. According to the 1926 Soviet Census, the town accounted for over 69% of Ukrainians. The town's name is derived from the name of the village Slavyanskaya in 1958. Slavyansk has already existed since the USSR in the Donetsk region so a city name added clarification "-on-Kuban". The name was given to the village by name strengthen "Slavic feldshanets" Slavic Hussars, which had been under the command of Alexander Suvorov on the right bank of the Kuban. Different sources give different emphasis to the name ‚ÄúSlavyansk‚Äù - on the first and the second syllable, however, the locals accepted the name Slavyansk on the first syllable, although it contradicts the rules of the Russian language.
