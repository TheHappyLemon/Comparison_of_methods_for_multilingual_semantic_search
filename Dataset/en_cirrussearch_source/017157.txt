The GP3 Series, or GP3 for short, was a single-seater motor racing series launched in 2010 as a feeder series for the GP2 Series, introduced by GP2 organiser Bruno Michel. GP3 followed the entire European leg of the Formula One series and the GP2 (now Formula 2) series as a support race for the two. Like the GP2 series, GP3 gave drivers the experience of the Grand Prix environment, and took advantage of the infrastructure, such as marshals and medical facilities, in place for the Formula One events. GP3 Series mainly raced on European circuits, but had appearances on other international race tracks, with rounds in the 2015 season at the Bahrain International Circuit in Bahrain and the Yas Marina Circuit in United Arab Emirates. Many drivers had since stepped up to GP2 since the series began, with the 2010 champion Esteban Gutiérrez, Pål Varhaug and ninth-place finisher Stefano Coletti being the first to do so for the 2011 season. 2011 champion Valtteri Bottas did not follow suit, however, and instead joined Williams as a reserve driver. Meanwhile, James Calado, Rio Haryanto, Simon Trummer, Tom Dillmann and Nigel Melker all joined GP2 for the 2012 season. Other drivers who have graduated to other series are James Jakes who moved to the IndyCar Series for 2011, Josef Newgarden to the Indy Lights series in 2011 and Alexander Rossi and Robert Wickens who moved to the Formula Renault 3.5 Series in 2011 and Lewis Williamson in 2012. In the series' short history, thirteen drivers have gone on to compete in Formula One. These include former champions Gutiérrez, Daniil Kvyat, Bottas, Esteban Ocon, Jean-Éric Vergne, Carlos Sainz Jr., and Charles Leclerc. In 2019 the series merged with the FIA Formula 3 European Championship and became the FIA Formula 3 Championship. The GP3 Series car was a standardised car used by all of the competing teams. For the 2010–2012 seasons, the GP3 series used the GP3/10 chassis. Chassis The car had been designed and built by Dallara, who currently produces the F2 chassis. Engine The GP3/10 used a race-tuned four-cylinder 2.0-litre turbocharged 280 hp engine developed by Renault Sport (based on B20F engine), while turbochargers were supplied by Pankl Racing Systems. The wastegate was included due to turbocharger rules. Gearbox The GP3/10 used a 6 speed longitudinal sequential Hewland gearbox. Tyres Pirelli supplied the tyres for GP3 from 2010 to 2012, same supplier for the GP2 Series.

The qualifying session is a straight fight for the fastest laptime, and determines the order of the grid for Saturday's Race 1. Race 2 is on Sunday. The grid is decided by the Saturday result with top 8 being reversed, so the driver who finished 8th on Saturday will start from pole position and the winner will start from 8th place. The distance of each race is decided prior to the event, however, should 30 minutes elapse before the designated number of laps are completed the lead driver will be shown the chequered flag. Pole for Saturday races: 2 points Fastest lap: 1 point in each race Driver recording fastest lap has to drive 90% of race laps and must finish in the top ten of the race to be eligible for the fastest lap point. With this points system, the most points anyone can score in one round is 20 by claiming pole position, winning both races with the fastest lap in each race. No driver ever did manage to get maximum points with this system. The closest drivers who have done so are Esteban Gutiérrez at the 2010 British round, who managed pole position for the feature race, won the feature race and got the fastest lap, and then came third in the sprint race, which equals a total of 17 points. Valtteri Bottas at the 2011 Hungarian round achieved pole position and won the feature race, and then came second in the sprint race, also totaling 17 points. Pole for Saturday races: 4 points Fastest lap: 2 points in each race Driver recording fastest lap has to drive 90% of race laps and must finish in the top ten of the race to be eligible for the fastest lap point. With this points system, the most points anyone can score in one round is 48 by claiming pole position, winning both races with the fastest lap in each race. So far throughout the new points system, no driver has achieved the maximum number of points in a single round. In the Hungarian round of 2012, António Félix da Costa became first driver to win both races of the weekend. GP3 Series has ten European teams and thirty drivers representing the Series. Manor Racing, Atech CRS GP and Carlin represent Great Britain, whilst flying the French flag is GP2 Series 2009 Champions ART Grand Prix and Tech 1 Racing. MW Arden in association with ex-Formula One driver Mark Webber race under an Australian license. Spaniard Addax Team, German RSC Mücke Motorsport in association with Ralf Schumacher, Irish-Canadian Status Grand Prix, and Swiss team Jenzer Motorsport complete the lineup.
