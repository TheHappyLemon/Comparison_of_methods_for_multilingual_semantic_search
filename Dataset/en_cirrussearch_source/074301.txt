The indigenous minority peoples of the North, Siberia, and the Far East of Russia (Russian: коренные малочисленные народы Севера, Сибири и Дальнего Востока) is a Russian census classification of local indigenous peoples, assigned to groups with fewer than 50,000 members, living in the Russian Far North, Siberia or Russian Far East. They are frequently referred as indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North or indigenous peoples of the North. Today, 40 indigenous peoples are officially recognised by Russia as indigenous small-numbered peoples and are listed in the Unified Register of the Indigenous Small-Numbered Peoples (Единый перечень коренных, малочисленных народов Российской Федерации). This register includes 46 Indigenous peoples. Six of these peoples do not live in either the Extreme North or territories equated to it, so that the total number of recognised Indigenous peoples of the North is 40. The Komi-Izhemtsy or Izvatas, a subgroup of the Komi peoples, are seeking recognition from the Russian government as a distinct Indigenous people of the North. The Far North is the part of Russia which lies mainly beyond the Arctic Circle. However, this is the smaller part of the total territories inhabited by Indigenous peoples. These territories extend southward as far as to Vladivostok. Approximately 261,763 people are altogether part of this classification.
