She was able to return to training in mid-August with a pair of custom-made skates, but her injury problems continued. Lepistö withdrew from both Grand Prix events. In November, she said she was unable to wear skates for more than 15 minutes due to the nerve problem and would miss the entire season to allow her leg to heal fully.
