Tomáš Koubek (born 26 August 1992) is a Czech professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Bundesliga club FC Augsburg and the Czech Republic national team. Koubek made his league debut for Hradec Králové in a 2–1 win against Mladá Boleslav on 30 April 2011. After Hradec Králové were relegated at the end of the 2014–15 Czech First League, Koubek joined Sparta Prague on a four-year contract, immediately going out on loan to Slovan Liberec for the 2015–16 season. In October 2016, Sparta Prague ordered Koubek to train with their women's team, stating "women belong at the stove" in reaction to a decision against him by a female assistant referee, Lucie Ratajová. At the end of August 2017, Koubek transferred from Sparta Prague to French club Rennes for a four-year contract, becoming the club's second Czech goalkeeper after Petr Čech had played there between 2002 and 2004. He made his Ligue 1 debut in a 3-1 victory against Marseille on 10 September 2017. On 6 August 2019, German side FC Augsburg of the Bundesliga announced the transfer of Koubek from Rennes on a four-year contract for an undisclosed transfer fee. In October 2015, Koubek was called up by coach Pavel Vrba to the Czech senior team. He debuted in a friendly match against Scotland on 24 March 2016, ending in a 0-1 defeat. Later, Koubek was included in the final 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016. Koubek was not initially included in the Czech squad for UEFA Euro 2020. However, due to Jiří Pavlenka suffering an injury, Koubek replaced him for the match against Scotland.
