As an under-19 player, Raum gained his first experience in the senior sides and was part of the first team from the 2017–18 2. Bundesliga season.

In addition, Raum made 20 appearances in at second-highest German level and mainly played as a substitute in the following seasons. His contract, which was set to expire in June 2020, was extended with an option for an additional year in May 2020.
