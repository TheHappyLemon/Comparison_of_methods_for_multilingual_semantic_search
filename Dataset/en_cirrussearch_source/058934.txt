Jorge de Amorim Campos (born 17 August 1964), better known as Jorginho, is a Brazilian professional football manager and former player who is the head coach of Thai League 1 club Buriram United. A quick, technically gifted, and hard-working right back, Jorginho is regarded as one of the best full-backs of his generation, and as one of the greatest Brazilian defenders of all time. He played in his native country for five different clubs, and also spent six years in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich and three in Japan with Kashima Antlers; at international level, he was part of the Brazilian team that won the 1994 World Cup. After retiring in 2002, Jorginho took up coaching for a short period before working as the assistant to head coach Dunga with the Brazil national team for four years. He later returned to coaching duties, being in charge of several clubs in his home country as well as his former side Kashima Antlers in Japan and Al Wasl in the UAE. Born in Rio de Janeiro, Jorginho started playing professionally for local side América Football Club, moving after just one season to Clube de Regatas do Flamengo. In 1989, he went overseas, joining German Bundesliga outfit Bayer 04 Leverkusen. With most teams in the country playing in a 5–3–2 or 3–5–2 formation, his tremendous offensive ability was put to good use, and he scored five goals for Bayer during his third and final season. Staying in the country, Jorginho signed with league giants FC Bayern Munich in 1992–93, backed by a defensive line which included Olaf Thon, Thomas Helmer and later Lothar Matthäus. He won the national title in his second year, but after the loan return of Markus Babbel, a central defender who also operated on the right flank, he was restricted to just ten league contests in 1994–95. After still appearing with success for J.League's Kashima Antlers, winning both the league and MVP titles in 1996, Jorginho returned to Brazil and played until 39, with São Paulo FC, CR Vasco da Gama and Fluminense Football Club. In 2001, he paired at Vasco with both Romário and Bebeto, but did not seem to get along with the pair. Jorginho was capped 64 times for the Brazil national team, scoring three goals. He played at both the 1990 and the 1994 FIFA World Cups. In the latter edition, he played all the matches as the nation emerged victorious. Jorginho was booked in the second-round match against the United States, but was named in the All-Star squad a few days later. He contributed two assists in the tournament, including a cross in the semifinals against Sweden that helped Romário score the winning goal. He also performed solidly against Italy in the final, including a play in which he freed himself from a double-team. However, he got injured after just twenty minutes of play, and was replaced by Cafú. In 2006, Jorginho was hired as the head coach of first side América. However, on 31 July of that same year, he was hired as Brazil's assistant, joining the staff of former national side teammate Dunga. In two 2008 friendlies, he took over for the manager, following Dunga's dismissal in the previous game and subsequent ban from the Brazilian Football Confederation; he led the team to two 1–0 wins, against the Republic of Ireland and Sweden. Both left the national team following the 2010 World Cup quarterfinal loss against Holland. Internationally, Jorginho also helped the Olympic team win silver at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Jorginho started his coaching career with his first club America in December 2005. In the following year, he was appointed Dunga's assistant at the Brazil national team, remaining with the role until 2010. On 30 August 2010, Jorginho was announced as the new Goiás head coach. Dismissed on 8 November, he was appointed head coach of Figueirense the following 1 March. On 21 December 2011, Jorginho left Figueira and was named at the helm of Kashima Antlers, a club he already represented as a player. He returned to Brazil on 17 March 2013, being appointed Flamengo head coach, but was sacked on 6 June. Jorginho was subsequently in charge of Ponte Preta and Al-Wasl before being named head coach of former club Vasco on 16 August 2015. Despite failing to avoid relegation, he was maintained and won the 2016 Campeonato Carioca; after achieving immediate promotion, he resigned on 28 November 2016. On 1 June 2017, Jorginho was appointed head coach of Bahia, but his reign only lasted nearly two months. The following 21 May he replaced fired Marcelo Chamusca at the helm of Ceará, but resigned on 4 June after alleging "personal reasons"; the day after his resignation, he was announced back at Vasco. Jorginho was fired on 13 August 2018, after only 10 matches. During the 2019 season, he coached second division sides Ponte Preta and Coritiba, achieving top tier promotion with the latter side but still leaving on 11 December after failing to agree new terms. On 21 August 2020, Jorginho was named back at the helm of Coritiba, replacing sacked Eduardo Barroca. He was himself relieved from his duties on 25 October, with the club in the relegation zone. On 5 April 2021, Jorginho was appointed head coach of Atlético Goianiense still in the top tier. He resigned on 15 May, after just 13 matches. On 3 July 2021, Jorginho took over first division newcomers Cuiabá. He managed to keep the club in the first division, but left when his contract ended after failing to agree new terms. On 16 May 2022, Jorginho returned to Atlético, replacing sacked Umberto Louzer, but was himself dismissed on 27 August. On 5 September, he returned to Vasco in the second tier, and left on 10 November after achieving promotion. On 25 March 2024, Jorginho has accepted an offer from Buriram United in the Thai League, with the team's aim being to win the domestic championship and succeed in the AFC Champions League. Jorginho is a born-again Christian. Alongside compatriots Cláudio Taffarel and Bismarck – also footballers – he was featured sharing his faith in a special version of the film Jesus, produced and distributed during the 1998 World Cup. He also founded the club Bola Pra Frente in his Rio de Janeiro slum of Guadalupe.
