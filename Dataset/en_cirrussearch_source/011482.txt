This is a list of the duchies and dukes of Pomerania. The lands of Pomerania were firstly ruled by local tribes, who settled in Pomerania around the 10th and 11th centuries. In 1106, Pomerania is divided by his two older sons: Wartislaw, who founded the House of Pomerania and the Duchy of Pomerania, and Świętopełk I. After Swietopelk's death, his lands were occupied by the Saxon prince Lothar of Supplinburg. In 1155, the lands regained independence under Sobieslaw I, who founded the dynasty of the Samborides, and the Duchy of Pomerelia. The Duchy resulted from the partition of Świętobor, Duke of Pomerania, in which his son Wartislaw inherited the lands that would become in fact known as Pomerania. In 1155, Pomerania was divided in Pomerania-Szczecin and Pomerania-Demmin. In the struggle to shake off Polish and Danish claims to feudal overlordship, Pomerania approached the Holy Roman Empire. In 1181, while staying in the camp outside the walls of Lübeck, Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa recognised Bogislaw I as duke of S(c)lavia, as it was called in the document. However, three years later in the Battle in the Bay of Greifswald (1184) the Danish Canute VI forced Pomerania to accept him as liege lord. In 1190 the Land of Słupsk-Sławno separated itself from Szczecin. With the defeat of Denmark in the Battle of Bornhöved (1227) Pomerania shook off the Danish liege-lordship, except for the city of Szczecin which remained under Danish suzerainty until 1235. In 1231 Emperor Frederick II granted the immediate liege lordship over Pomerania to the Margrave of Brandenburg, who enforced this claim by the Treaties of Kremmen (1236) and of Landin (1250). Thus Pomerania had become a fief of Brandenburg, thus an only mediate (indirect) subfief of the Empire, with Brandenburg itself being an immediate imperial fief. In 1227, Słupsk came to Eastern Pomerania (Pomerelia) within fragmented Poland, Sławno to Western Pomerania. In 1238 both became part of Pomerelia, ruled by the House of Sobiesław, and following the extinction of the line in 1294, both were directly reintegrated with Poland in accordance with the Treaty of Kępno. In 1317, the area became part of the Pomerania-Wolgast (Wołogoszcz), first as a pawn from Brandenburg, and definitively in 1347. After Wartislaw III died heirless in 1264, Barnim I became sole duke of the whole duchy. After Barnim's death, the duchy was to be ruled by his sons Barnim II, Otto I and Bogislaw IV. The first years, Bogislaw, being the eldest, ruled in place of his too young brothers. In 1295, the Duchy of Pomerania was divided roughly by the Peene and Ina rivers, with the areas north of these rivers ruled by Bogislaw IV became Pomerania-Wolgast, whereas Otto I received Pomerania-Szczecin south of these rivers. In 1368, Pomerania-Wolgast was divided into a western part (German: Wolgast diesseits der Swine, including the name-giving residence in Wolgast) and an eastern part (German: Wolgast jenseits der Swine, in literature also called Pomerania-Stolp or Duchy of Słupsk after the residence in Słupsk (Stolp)), which came back under Polish suzerainty as a fief. In 1376, the western part of Pomerania-Wolgast (German: Wolgast diesseits der Swine) was subdivided in a smaller western part sometimes named Pomerania-Barth (Bardo) after the residence in Barth, and an eastern part which included the residence in Wolgast. In the following year, the Duchy of Słupsk was divided into a western part which included Stargard and an eastern part which included the residence in Słupsk (Stolp). In 1459, the eastern partitions of Pomerania-Wolgast around Stargard and Stolp ceased to exist. In 1478, after 200 years of partition, the duchy was reunited for a short period when all her parts were inherited by Bogislaw X. By the Treaty of Pyritz in 1493 Pomerania shook off the Marcher liege lordship and became again an immediate imperial estate, after new disputes finally confirmed by the Treaty of Grimnitz in 1529, both treaties provided Brandenburg succession in case the Pomeranian dukes would become extinct in the male line. In 1531, Pomerania was partitioned into Pomerania-Stettin (Szczecin) and Pomerania-Wolgast. This time however, in contrast to the earlier partitions with the same names, Pomerania-Wolgast included the western, and Pomerania-Stettin the eastern parts of the duchy. In 1569, were created the duchies of -Barth (split off from -Wolgast) and -Rügenwalde (Darłowo) (split off from -Stettin). In 1625, Bogislaw XIV reunited all Pomerania under his rule. However, in 1637, Sweden hold western parts of Pomerania (Hither Pomerania), originally including Stettin, legalised by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 (Swedish Pomerania, several times reduced in favour of Brandenburgian Pomerania). Between 1637 and 1657 Lauenburg-Bütow Land (Lębork and Bytów) were reintegrated directly to Poland as a reverted fief, thereafter passed to Brandenburg under Polish overlordship until the Partitions of Poland. In 1648, Brandenburg prevailed in the Peace of Westphalia with its claim only for eastern parts of Pomerania (Farther Pomerania), with the Brandenburg electors officially holding simultaneously the title of dukes of Pomerania until 1806 (end of the Empire and its enfeoffments), but de facto integrating their Pomerania into Brandenburg-Prussia, making it one of the provinces of Prussia in 1815, then including former Swedish Pomerania. (Note: Here the numbering of the dukes is the same for all duchies, as all were titled Dukes of Pomerania, despite the different parts of land or particular numbering of the rulers. The dukes are numbered by the year of their succession.) The Principality was initially a Danish feud, under local rulers, which formed a dynasty. In 1155, the lands which belonged to Świętopełk I were organized by Sobieslaw I into the Duchy of Eastern Pomerania, also known as the Pomerelia, a provincial duchy of fragmented Poland. Sobiesław founded the House of Sobiesław. The dukes of Pomerelia were using the Latin title dux Pomeraniae ("Duke of Pomerania") or dux Pomeranorum ("Duke of the Pomeranians"). In 1215, the duchy was divided in other smaller duchies: Gdańsk, Białogarda, Lubiszewo and Świecie.   Gdańsk   Białogarda   Lubiszewo   Świecie In 1271 the duchy is reunited and in 1294 reincorporated directly into Poland per the Treaty of Kępno. 1296–1299 Part of Kuyavia within Poland 1299–1308 Part of Poland 1308–1454 Part of the State of the Teutonic Order 1454–1466 Thirteen Years' War between Poland and the Teutonic Order 1466–1772 Pomeranian Voivodeship (1466–1772) within the Kingdom of Poland, which was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1569 1772–1793 Mostly annexed by Prussia in the First Partition of Poland, except for Gdańsk, which remained with Poland until Second Partition of Poland 1793–1807 Province of West Prussia within the Kingdom of Prussia (Prussian Partition of Poland) 1807–1814 Part of Prussia, except for the Free City of Danzig (Gdańsk) a Napoleonic client state, with François Joseph Lefebvre ennobled as Duc de Dantzic (1808–1820) 1814–1918 Part of the Kingdom of Prussia, which was part of the German Empire from 1871 1814–1829 Province of West Prussia 1829–1878 Province of Prussia 1878–1919 Province of West Prussia 1920–1939 Part of Poland as the Pomeranian Voivodeship, except of Free City of Danzig, a League of Nations mandate 1939–1945 German occupation: Danzig-West Prussia, province of Nazi Germany 1945–present Part of Poland again History of Pomerania Gerard Labuda (ed.), "Historia Pomorza", vol. 1–4, Poznan-Torun 1969–2003 Edmund Kopicki, "Tabele dynastyczne", "Wykazy panujacych", in: "Katalog podstawowych monet i banknotow Polski oraz ziem z historycznie z Polska zwiazanych", vol.

Between 1184 and 1208 Demmin was reunited with Stettin. Also called Szczecin. Also called Sławno-Słupsk Rugen reannexed to Wolgast in 1393-94 and 1451-57. Also called Słupsk; Between 1377 and 1395 Stargard emerged as a short-lived state. Barth and Rugenwalde split off and reunited with Stettin several times between 1569 and 1620. Other historians suggest that he could be also son of Bogislaw II or Mestwin I of Pomerelia. Barnim IV seemed to have ascended first (1326) then Barnim III, who assumed his rule in 1344. However, as stated, Barnim III was co-ruling with his father since 1320, which motivated his numbering being lower. Eric arrived in Pomerania only in 1449. This opens the question of who was Maria of Masovia being regent for in the period 1446-49. A possibility is that Sophie, the then minor daughter of Boguslaus IX, was reigning under regency of her mother, and stepped down for Eric I, returning after the latter's death.

Kommentierte Edition einer zeitgenössischen Beschreibung, in: Baltische Studien, NF 94, 2008, pp. 55–70 Numbered XIII, because of infants Boguslaus XI (son of George I, born and died in 1514) and Boguslaus XII (son of Barnim IX, born and died in 1542) who never ruled. This skipping also compromised the numbering of Boguslaus XIV. Boguslaus XIII was the eleventh ruler of this name. It's possible that the Ukrainian Hubytsky family could descend from the Pomeranian ducal family though Boguslaus II. Boguslaus XIV was the twelfth ruler of this name.
