The German-Baltic Reform Party (German: Deutsch-Baltische Reformpartei) was a Baltic German political party in Latvia during the inter-war period. It contested elections as part of the Committee of the German Baltic Parties alliance. The party was led by Edwin Magnus. The party was formed on 25 January 1920 by moderate rightwing-liberal sectors in the German minority. It was dissolved on 15 May 1934 following the self-coup by Kārlis Ulmanis. Wende, Frank (1981).
