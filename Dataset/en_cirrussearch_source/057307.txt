Hurricane, also known as Hurricane Girls, are a Serbian girl group. The original line-up, formed by Zoran Milinković in November 2017, consisted of three members: Sanja Vučić, Ivana Nikolić and Ksenia Knežević. They are best known for representing Serbia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 in Rotterdam, Netherlands, with the song "Loco loco". In 2022, the three original members left the group and were replaced by three new members: Jovana Radić, Sara Kourouma and Miona Srećković. They sing mostly in their native language Serbian and have also sung songs in English on some occasions. Hurricane aimed to be recognized globally; they had two planned songs for Universal (as of November 2019), and in September 2018 collaborated with Hollywood producer Stephen Belafonte. Following their participation in the 2020 edition of Beovizija, they were to represent Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020, with the song "Hasta la vista". However, on 18 March 2020, the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 23 November 2020, it was confirmed that they would remain as the Serbia's representatives in the 2021 contest, and their song "Loco loco", was presented in March 2021. They performed in the second semi-final of the contest on 18 May, where they qualified to the final. In the final, they finished in 15th place, receiving 102 points. On 4 May 2022, it was announced that the current line-up of the group would part ways after a farewell tour, after which the members would embark on solo careers. It was also announced that the casting process for new members would begin shortly, while retaining the Hurricane name. The group's last single as Vučić, Nikolić and Knežević, "Wow", was released on 19 June 2022. The group, with its new lineup of Jovana Radić, Sara Kourouma and Miona Srećković participated in Pesma za Evroviziju '23 with the song "Zumi zimi zami" in order to represent Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 and placed 12th in the final.
