Chroicocephalus is a genus of medium to relatively small gulls which were included in the genus Larus until recently. Some authorities also include the Saunders's gull in Chroicocephalus. The genus name Chroicocephalus is from Ancient Greek khroizo, "to colour", and kephale, "head". Representatives of this genus are found in regions/subregions all over the world, each species usually being confined to a region. Huahine gull †Chroicocephalus utunui -French Polynesia.
