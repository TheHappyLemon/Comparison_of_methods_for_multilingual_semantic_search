Viktor Troicki (Serbian Cyrillic: Виктор Троицки, pronounced [ʋîktor troǐtskiː]; born 10 February 1986) is a Serbian former professional tennis player. He won his first ATP singles title at the 2010 Kremlin Cup, and his second and third ATP singles titles at the 2015 and 2016 Apia International Sydney. His biggest achievements were a career-high singles ranking of world No. 12 (achieved in June 2011) and winning the deciding rubber in Serbia's Davis Cup final against France in 2010. Since then, in every Davis Cup he attended, he has contributed to Serbia reaching a quarterfinal or better. He is known for serving a 12-month ban for an anti-doping rule violation in 2013–14 for missing a blood test. By winning the inaugural ATP Cup in 2020, Troicki became the first player in tennis Open Era history to win all three major team competitions (Davis Cup in 2010 and World Team Cup in 2009 and 2012). In December 2020, Troicki was appointed captain of the Serbian team for the Davis Cup and ATP Cup. Troicki was born on 10 February 1986 in Belgrade, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia, to Aleksandar, a lawyer, and Mila, an economist.

In 2012 with only two quarterfinal appearances, this season compared to previous seasons' individual results were subpar, however his contributions to the Serbian national team did result in winning the World Team Cup along with a third consecutive quarterfinal appearance at the Davis Cup. Troicki won the Boodles Challenge, a warm-up to Wimbledon exhibition, defeating Robin Haase 7–5, 6–4 in the final. On 25 July 2013, Troicki was banned from playing tennis for 18 months, for failing to provide a blood sample at the Monte-Carlo Masters event. However, the suspension was reduced on appeal to one year, meaning he could play from 15 July 2014. After the Court of Arbitration for Sport announced their decision, Troicki, who had hoped his suspension would be overturned, said that he has "no idea about what to do now or where to go. I hope somehow I will be able to fight back." After serving his doping suspension, Troicki made his return to professional tennis at the Swiss Open, an ATP 250 event in Gstaad, receiving a wildcard into the main draw. He defeated 8th seed Dominic Thiem and Andrey Golubev en route to the quarterfinals, where he lost to fourth seed Fernando Verdasco.

Troicki lost in the second round of qualifying at the Shanghai Masters, however qualified for the main draw in Erste Bank Open, and ultimately made it to the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Andy Murray in straight sets. His form after returning to the ATP Tour meant his ranking rose from 847th in the world to a year-end ranking just outside the top 100, finishing 102. At the Apia International in Sydney in January 2015, Troicki defeated Gilles Müller 6–2, 6–4 in the semifinals en route to defeating Mikhail Kukushkin 6–2, 6–3 in the finals to capture his second career title. In the first ATP final in history featuring two qualifiers, Troicki dispatched Kukushkin in 64 minutes after breaking the Kazakh twice in each set. This victory brought him 38 positions up on ATP ladder to the position of 54 prior to the Australian Open. At the Australian Open, he reached the third round before being eliminated by world No. 7, Tomáš Berdych in straight sets. In March, Troicki defeated young Croatian prodigy Borna Ćorić in five epic sets in round one of the Davis Cup; Serbia would go on to win and progress to the quarterfinals. In June, defeating Marin Čilić on 14 June, Troicki played in the finals of Stuttgart Mercedes Cup versus Rafael Nadal. Troicki played very well but Nadal won in straight sets, 7–6, 6–3. Seeded No. 22, his US Open campaign opened with a straight-sets victory over wildcard Frances Tiafoe and a 3–1 win over Rajeev Ram before losing in the third round to Donald Young having won the first two sets. In January, Troicki collected this third career title at the Apia International Sydney, defeating Grigor Dimitrov 2–6, 6–1, 7–6 and saving a championship point en route to his title defense. It was his second encounter in as many weeks with Dimitrov, who had gotten the better of him in three sets in their prior meeting at the Brisbane International. At the Australian Open, he equaled his 2015 result by reaching the third round. In February, he reached the final of the Sofia Open where he was defeated by Roberto Bautista Agut. At the French Open, he made it to fourth round where he lost to the defending champion Stan Wawrinka 7–6, 6–7, 6–3, 6–2 after three hours of play. Troicki lost in the second round of the Wimbledon Championships to Albert Ramos Viñolas. He was fined for the protracted verbal abuse of umpire Damiano Torella following Torella's overrule of a line call that resulted in a match point for Ramos Viñolas. Troicki lost the subsequent point and the match. At the Shanghai Masters in October, he recorded his first win over Rafael Nadal after six meetings. He reached the third round at the Australian Open, losing to US Open champion Stan Wawrinka in four sets, narrowly missing a tiebreaker in the fourth to push for a fifth set. In February, partnering Nenad Zimonjić he won his second ATP doubles title at Sofia Open. After that two solid wins at the first round of the Davis Cup ensured Serbia would reached the quarterfinals for the seventh time in eight years. At the Davis Cup quarterfinals in April, a straight sets victory over world No. 19 Pablo Carreño Busta saw him record a personal best serve of 233 km/h. A doubles victory with Nenad Zimonjić ensured a fourth Davis Cup semifinal for him & his country. In doubles, partnering Jan-Lennard Struff he reached the finals of Sydney International where they lost to Łukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo. In singles, Troicki went 6–13 at the ATP Tour level in 2018. He suffered from a lower back injury during 2018 which limited his playing time. As a result, he fell out of the top 200. He reached the second round of Australian Open where he lost in 4 sets to the 14th seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas. During the year most of his success came only during the grass season. Troicki reached the finals of Surbiton Trophy where he lost to Daniel Evans, quarterfinals of Antalya Open where he lost to an eventual finalist Miomir Kecmanović and round of 16 at Hall of Fame Open in Newport where he lost again to an eventual finalist, this time Alexander Bublik. By winning the inaugural ATP Cup in 2020 with Serbia, Troicki became the first player in history to win all three major international team competitions (Davis Cup in 2010 and World Team Cup in 2009 and 2012). During summer, Troicki tested positive for COVID-19, which affected his preparations for the restart of the tennis season due to pandemic. At the end of the year, he was appointed captain of the Serbia Davis Cup team. At the beginning of 2021, he qualified for the Australian Open main singles draw where he lost in the first round to Michael Mmoh in 5 tight sets. After failing to qualify for the main draw of Roland Garros he made a surprising run at Queen's Club by beating No. 7 seed Lorenzo Sonego in straight sets before losing in the round of 16 to Frances Tiafoe. He announced that Wimbledon would be his last professional tournament before he retires. In the first round of qualifying he beat Christopher Eubanks before being defeated in the second round by Brandon Nakashima after three tight sets. Troicki was a solid all-court player, who won more matches than he has lost on each surface. However, one factor that has kept him from more success is his poor record against top-10 players (65 losses vs 10 wins in his career).
