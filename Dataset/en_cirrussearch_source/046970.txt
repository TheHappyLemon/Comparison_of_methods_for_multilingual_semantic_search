At the US Open, she reached the third round of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time since the 2015 French Open, easily losing to Anastasija Sevastova. Vekić broke into the top 50 for the first time in July, reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 45 on 25 September, and ended the season ranked No. 56. At Wimbledon, Vekić reached the fourth round in a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in her career. She upset world No. 4, Sloane Stephens, in the first round, then beat Rebecca Peterson and Yanina Wickmayer in straight sets before losing to eventual semi-finalist Julia Görges. Following Wimbledon, she made the final at the Washington Open; however, she lost to Svetlana Kuznetsova in three sets, after squandering four match points in the second set.

She rebounded at her next tournament, reaching the biggest final of her career at the St. Petersburg Trophy, a Premier-level event. Along the way, she upset the defending champion, world No. 2 and Australian Open runner-up, Petra Kvitová, in the quarterfinals, her first career win over the Czech.

Opening the grass-court season in Nottingham, Vekić reached her second final of the year before falling to former world No. 4, Caroline Garcia, despite leading by a set and a break. After an opening-round loss to French Open champion Ashleigh Barty in Birmingham, Vekić was tabbed as a potential dark horse in the ladies' singles draw at Wimbledon. However, she was upset in three sets in her first round match by eventual quarterfinalist, American Alison Riske. Rebounding from this disappointment, Vekić opened the summer hardcourt season with a semifinal showing in San Jose, before making the third round in Cincinnati where she fell to Venus Williams. Seeded 23rd at the US Open, Vekić defeated Richèl Hogenkamp, Kaia Kanepi, Yulia Putintseva and 26th seed Julia Görges to advance to her first Grand Slam quarterfinal, becoming the first Croatian woman to reach the last eight at the US Open since Ana Konjuh in 2016. There, she was beaten by the 13th seed Bencic, in straight sets. Despite recording just two match wins in her next five tournaments following the US Open, Vekić qualified for the second tier year-end singles tournament, the WTA Elite Trophy, for the first time in her career. Drawn in the Azalea Group with top seed Bertens and Dayana Yastremska, she fell in straight sets in both her matches, ending her season.

With this run, she has reached the fourth round or better, completing the sweep of second-week appearances, at each of the four Grand Slam events. After the Australian Open, she underwent surgery on her right knee and said that she would be out of action for a while. Vekić returned in time for the French Open but was beaten in the first round by ninth seed Karolína Plíšková. Seeded third at the Nottingham Open, her first grass-court tournament of the season, Vekić lost in the third round to 15th seed Nina Stojanović.

Representing Croatia at the Summer Olympics, Vekić upset third seed Aryna Sabalenka in the second round. She was beaten in the third round by 15th seed and eventual semifinalist, Elena Rybakina. Unable to defend her points from the 2019 US Open, Vekić fell out of the top 100 on 20 September 2021 to world No. 101, her lowest ranking in five years since year-end 2016. However, after winning her third WTA Tour title at the Courmayeur Open in October, she returned to the top 70. She took a two-month hiatus between the Australian Open and before Rolland Garros returning to the WTA tour in April. Ranked No. 101, she qualified for 2022 French Open as the sixth qualifier seed. It was the first time Vekić has had to contest qualifying for a major since the 2016 US Open, due to injury and missing play between Australian Open and Roland Garros in 2021, leading to a dip in the rankings. After making the main draw at the French Open and a first-round win over Mirjam Björklund, she was defeated by Amanda Anisimova in the second round. At Wimbledon, Vekić lost in the first round to Jessica Pegula, in straight sets. On 17 October 2022, she returned to the top 50 at world No. 47 for the first time since July 2021 after a final showing at the WTA 500 San Diego Open as a qualifier, defeating four straight top-25 players (including two in the top 10) en route before losing to Iga Świątek. Vekić started her 2023 season at the 2023 United Cup, where she represented Croatia. She won all three of her matches in straight sets including a win over French player Alizé Cornet. After the United Cup she entered the Australian Open ranked No. 64. There she defeated Oksana Selekhmeteva, 18th seed Liudmila Samsonova, Nuria Parrizas-Diaz and Linda Fruhvirtová to reach her first Australian Open quarterfinal. There she lost to the eventual champion, Aryna Sabalenka, in straight sets. As a result, she moved up 30 places in the rankings and re-entered the top 40 at world No. 33 on 30 January 2023. Vekić won her fourth career title defeating top seed Caroline Garcia in three tight sets at the Monterrey Open in Mexico. The victory was her first top-ten win of the season and first title since 2021. As a result, she returned to the top 25 on 6 March 2023. Vekić is an aggressive baseliner. She possesses a powerful first serve that is capable of producing aces, and has been recorded as high as 111 mph (179 km/h), but is somewhat inaccurate, meaning that she typically has first serve percentages between 50 and 60 percent. She makes up for this with a reliable second serve, so that double faults are uncommon. Her groundstrokes are powerful, allowing her to dictate play from the baseline, and her forehand, which is hit hard, flat, and fast, is her greatest asset. Due to her quick and aggressive style of play, she accumulates significant numbers of both winners and unforced errors. She is also a quick mover, with impressive speed and footwork. Due to her movement and stamina, Vekić is adept at counterpunching until she can create an opportunity to hit a winner; her increased success in recent years has been as a result of her altering her game style away from solely aggressive play, to constructing points more deliberately, and increasing her defensive skills. Vekić's fast and quick style of play is especially suited to fast hard and grass courts, where the vast majority of her success has taken place. Her major areas of weakness are that she is reluctant to come to the net, she is not as proficient on slower courts such as clay courts, and she struggles against aggressive all-court players who play with variety, such as Ashleigh Barty, Iga Świątek, and Anastasija Sevastova. Beyond tennis, Vekić established a luxury home fragrance brand, DNNA, in 2021, selling beeswax candles and reed diffusers. She announced that a proportion of all sales revenue will be donated towards bee conservation in her native Croatia.
