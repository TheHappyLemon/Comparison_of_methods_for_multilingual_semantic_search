Soon after leaving Nalchik Višņakovs went on trial with Cracovia, playing in the Polish Ekstraklasa.

But the next season, Cracovia were relegated from Ekstraklasa and Višņakovs terminated his contract by a mutual agreement. In July 2012 Višņakovs was about to sign a contract with the Latvian Higher League club Spartaks Jūrmala, but eventually the move fell through and Aleksejs joined the Russian First Division club Baltika Kaliningrad on 11 August 2012, signing a one-year contract.
