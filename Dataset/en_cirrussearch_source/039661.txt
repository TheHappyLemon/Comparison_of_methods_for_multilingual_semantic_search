In December 2010, Uralkali announced plans to buy another Russian potash producer Silvinit; together they would form one of the world's largest potash producers. The merger was finalized in June 2011, with the combined Uralkali accounting for about 20% of the world's potash production. On 9 November 2012, Chengdong Investment Corp., a unit of the sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, bought bonds from the shareholders with maturation in 2014 which were exchangeable into a stake in Uralkali. Chengdong would be able to convert its investment into a 12.5 percent stake in Uralkali's ordinary shares. In September 2013, the bonds were converted and CIC thus acquired a 12.5% stake in the firm, rumoured to be worth around $2 billion. In June 2012, Green Patrol, a Russian environmental non-governmental organization, listed Uralkali as one of the top 100 polluters in Russia, based on information gathered during the previous years. An expedition organised into the Perm Krai by Green Patrol in 2010 revealed that Uralkali's sinks contained at least 16 harmful elements (including zinc and ammonium), exceeding the maximum permissible levels by 1,850 times. Furthermore, according to Green Patrol's President Roman Pukalov, Uralkali failed to fully disclose a complete list of harmful elements that it routinely rejected into the local river Kama. Roman Pukalov described Kama water as "very polluted", and declared that small rivers around Berezniki had in fact turned into brine, something he had "never seen anywhere else". On 30 July 2013 Uralkali announced that it was pulling out of the Belarusian Potash Company export JV with Belaruskali, through which it exported potash from 2005 to July 2013, and said it would sell the fertilizer on its own. This move sent shares of potash companies tumbling on speculation that potash prices would plunge. This dispute arose over foreign sales and top executives at Uralkali were accused of a criminal scheme. On 26 August Belarus detained the company's CEO Vladislav Baumgertner after inviting him to Minsk for talks. In September 2013 he was moved from solitary confinement and put under house arrest.[citation needed] Uralkali insists that persecution of its employees by Belarusian officials is politically motivated. On 14 October Russia opened a criminal investigation into Vladislav Baumgertner as well, and investigators announced they will request his extradition from Belarus. In November 2013 Vladislav Baumgertner was extradited to Russia and later put under house arrest. In September 2014 he was released on bail. In December 2013 Suleiman Kerimov sold his shares (21.75%) to ONEXIM Group, while Dmitry Mazepin's Uralchem acquired 19.99%, both becoming key shareholders in Uralkali. In November 2015, Uralkali's board approved its latest share buyback program, a move that was expected to result in the delisting of the company's stock in London. Uralkali, which also trades in Moscow, said it will repurchase as much as 6.5 percent of its shares from the open market by the end of March 2016. On 5 October 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued an order asking the General Attorney of the Federation of Russia Yury Chaika to verify the compliance of Uralkali with the legislation governing planning works and mines filling. Results were to be presented on 1 December 2016, but as of end January 2017 the outcome of the investigation has not been published yet. In 2021, it was announced that Uralkali would become the title sponsor of Haas F1 Team after Nikita Mazepin, son of Dmitry Mazepin, signed with the team for the 2021 season. Uralkali also sponsors Hitech GP's cars in the GB3 Championship. In December 2021, Uralkali bought UPI Norte, Brazilian holding and shareholder of FertGrow S.A., local major distributor of fertilizers. In December 2021, Uralkali-Invest of Uralkali made a buyback of 3,4% of equity shares of Uralchem. By the beginning of 2022, the total of 22.36% of Uralkali voting shares is on the balance of Uralkali-Invest. Before in 2021, the investment division of Uralkali has also acquired 18,5% of equity capital of Uralchem from Dmitry Lobiak, Mazepin's business partner. In February 2022, as a consequence of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Haas removed the branding of its sponsor Uralkali from its cars and equipment, before eventually terminating Uralkali's sponsorship contract, as well as Mazepin's driver contract, which was based on the Uralkali deal, in March. By 2000, Dmitry Rybolovlev gained complete control over Uralkali, consolidating over 50% of the shares. By October 2006, he became chairman of the board of directors and in June 2010 owned approximately 65.5% of the company's shares. In early 2011, Rybolovlev disposed of his shares. As of April 2011, the company was owned by the following Russian businessmen: Suleyman Kerimov (25%), Alexander Nesis (17.7%), Filaret Galchev (15%), and Alexander Mamut (3.5%), while all other shares were in free float. At the end of December 2013, 21.75% of the company's shares were held by Mikhail Prokhorov's ONEXIM Group, 19.99% by Dmitry Mazepin's Uralchem, 12.5% by the Chinese Chengdong Investment Corporation, and the rest was in free float. On 23 December 2013, Dmitry Osipov, the former deputy board chairman of Uralchem, was appointed chief executive officer of the company. As of 7 March 2018, the shareholding structure of PJSC Uralkali was as follows: 5.23% shares were in free float, 20% were owned by Rinsoco Trading Co. Limited (registered in Cyprus and controlled by Dmitry Lobyak), 20.1% belonged to Uralchem (controlled by Dmitry Mazepin), and 54.77% were quasi-treasury shares (on the balance of the subsidiary Uralkali-Technology). Vitaly Lauk was appointed as CEO of Uralkali effective 4 December 2020. Since September 2017, Vitaly Lauk has been the Technical Director and member of the management board of the company. Uralkali develops the Verkhnekamskoye potassium and magnesium salt deposit, one of the world's largest. A substantial part of natural potassium salt is processed into a commercial product, potassium chloride, which is used as a fertiliser applied either directly to the soil or as an ingredient of compound NPK[clarification needed] fertilisers. In addition, potash is used in other industries such as chemical, petrochemical, food, and pharmaceutical. The company accounts for a significant share of global potassium chloride production with 80% of the company's products being exported overseas. The main buyers are Brazil, India, China, Southeast Asia, Russia, the US and the EU. The company's production volume in 2020 was 11.3 million tonnes of KCl. As of late 2020, Uralkali employed about 12,700 people in the main production unit. The company's net revenue for 2020 amounted to $2,151 million, while the 2020 EBITDA was $1,222 million.[citation needed] Uralkali reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 1,704 Kt (-6.3 /-0.4% y-o-y).
