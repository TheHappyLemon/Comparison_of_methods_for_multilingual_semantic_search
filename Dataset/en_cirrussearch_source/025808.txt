Maranello (Modenese: Maranèl) is a comune (municipality) in the province of Modena, in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, 18 km from Modena, with a population of 17,504 as of 2017. It is known worldwide as the home of Ferrari and the Formula One racing team, Scuderia Ferrari. Maranello was also home to coachbuilding firm Carrozzeria Scaglietti, owned by Ferrari. Maranello has been the location of the Ferrari factory since the early 1940s. During World War II, Enzo Ferrari transferred to Modena, ending its ownership of Alfa Romeo. Initially Ferrari's factory in Maranello was shared with Auto Avio Costruzioni, a machine tool manufacturing business started by Enzo to tide the company over while Alfa Romeo's ban on Enzo Ferrari making cars bearing the Ferrari name was in force. Maranello also houses the Museo Ferrari public museum, collecting sports and racing cars and trophies. Its new library opened in November 2011, and was designed by Arata Isozaki and Andrea Maffei. Maranello is the starting point of the annual Italian Marathon, which finishes in nearby Carpi. Maranello's new town library was designed jointly by Andrea Maffei and Isozaki. The library opened in 2012. The parish church of San Biagio was rebuilt in 1903.
