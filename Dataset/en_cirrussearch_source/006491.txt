.lu is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Luxembourg. .lu domains are administered by RESTENA. Since 1 February 2010, the administrative contact no longer needs to be based in Luxembourg. For many years, applications for .lu domains could be made only via postal mail or fax. The fees for a .lu second level domain are €40 for the creation (or modification of a contact) and €40 yearly (including VAT). On 18 September 2006, the registry introduced a domain name registrar model. While the classic paper registration is possible, registering with a certified registrar is preferred by RESTENA.
