Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Kyrgyzstan ratified the convention on 3 July 1995. Kyrgyzstan has three sites on the list. The first site, the Sulayman Mountain, was listed in 2009. The Silk Road corridors were listed in 2014 and the most recent site, the Western Tien-Shan, was listed in 2016. The Sulayman Mountain and the Silk Roads are cultural sites, the Western Tien-Shan is a natural site. The Silk Roads site is shared with China and Kazakhstan while the Western Tien-Shan is shared with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In addition, Kyrgyzstan has two sites on the tentative list. UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.   * Transnational site In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Kyrgyzstan has two properties on its tentative list.
