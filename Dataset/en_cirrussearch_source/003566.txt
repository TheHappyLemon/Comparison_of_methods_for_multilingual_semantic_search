A low-floor tram is a tram that has no stairsteps between one or more entrances and part or all of the passenger cabin. The low-floor design improves the accessibility of the tram for the public, and also may provide larger windows and more airspace. An accessible platform-level floor in a tram can be achieved either by using a high-floor vehicle serving high-platform tram stops, or with a true low-floor vehicle interfacing with curb level stops. Currently both types are in use, depending on the station platform infrastructure in existing rail systems. Some systems may make use of former railway alignments where use of existing high platforms is desirable, while others, particularly new systems, may not have the space to site high-level stops in urban centres. Trams traditionally had high floors, and these designs evolved into the tram with a low-floor centre section. Examples of this design are Amsterdam 11g/12g-trams and the Kusttrams in Belgium. The most common design of 100% low floor vehicles uses short carbody sections for the wheels and longer suspended sections. Examples of this are the Alstom Citadis and Combino. A similar, but somewhat older technique is one that has been developed by MAN. In 1990, it was the first 100% low floor tram. These trams are found in ten German cities (such as Bremen and Munich) and in the Swedish city Norrköping. In many other German cities there are trams with low floor between the outer bogies and single axle bogies under the centre section. "Light rail" type vehicles frequently have a similar configuration but with a centre bogie designed to accommodate a low floor situated under a short centre section. A more radical approach has been adopted for the City Class LRV (Citytram), where the main low floor section is only 300 mm (12 in) above the rail. The low floor runs right through the articulation of both the 29 m (95 ft) long and 38 m (125 ft) Super Citytram version. In both, the corridor through the articulation is wide enough for seated passengers and a wheelchair to pass through. The City Class has been designed to turn on 15 m (49 ft) radius curves and to climb 10% gradients. In Austria, Porsche Design designed Ultra Low Floor (ULF) Trams can "kneel" at the curbside, reducing the height from the road to only 180 mm (7.1 in). Some public transport companies have both low floor and high floor trams. They report that low floor trams have 15% higher maintenance costs for the rolling stock, and 20% higher maintenance costs for the infrastructure on average. Among the problems observed is that the missing bogies result in a higher level of wear and tear. Many low floor trams have fixed bogies which increase track wear and tear, while decreasing the speed at which a tram can drive through a curve (usually 4–15 km/h (2.5–9.3 mph) in 20 m (66 ft) radius curve). The Škoda ForCity and the newest Alstom Citadis X04 try to counter the effect with low floor pivoting bogies while maintaining 100% low floor design. Prior to the new design, pivoting bogies could only be used under high floors, hence such trams could only be part low-floor, with high-floor sections over the pivoting bogies. The idea of a low-floor tram dates back to the early 20th century when a number of trolley systems began experimenting with various "stepless" designs. Perhaps the most notable is the Hedley-Doyle Stepless car introduced in 1912 for use on Broadway in Manhattan. A number of other cities also purchased Hedley-Doyle Stepless trams after seeing their success in Manhattan. Since these cars had a unique appearance compared to any other trams running at the time, they earned a number of nicknames, including hobble skirt cars, public welfare cars, and sow bellies. To put things into perspective, here are some typical floor heights for public transport vehicles, old and new: Ultra Low Floor tram — 180 mm (7.1 in) Low-floor tram — 300 to 350 mm (11.8 to 13.8 in) High-floor tram — more than 600 mm (23.6 in) Heavy rail rapid transit — 800 to 1,200 mm (31.5 to 47.2 in) North American inter-city rail passenger cars — 1,350 mm (53.1 in) Belkommunmash AKSM-743 - Third Generation tram on Minsk tramway AKSM-843 - Fourth generation tram on Minsk tramway Bombardier Transportation (are subtypes and more) A32 Flexity Swift Citytram Cobra CR4000 Flexity Swift GT8-100D/2S-M ET 2010 Flexity Swift (Tram-train) E-class Melbourne tram Flexity Swift Flexity 2 Flexity 2 (version for Blackpool) Flexity Berlin (Incentro family) Flexity Classic Flexity Freedom Flexity Link Flexity Outlook Eurotram Flexity Outlook Cityrunner Flexity Outlook Olympic Line Flexity Outlook (version for Toronto) GT8-100D/2S-M HF6 Flexity Swift (not low-floor, but due to the high platform is wheelchair-accessible) Incentro Incentro AT6/5 (version for Nottingham) K4000 Flexity Swift K4500 Flexity Swift K5000 Flexity Swift (not low-floor, but due to the high platform is wheelchair-accessible) K5200 Flexity Swift (not low-floor, but due to the high platform is wheelchair-accessible) M5000 Flexity Swift (not low-floor, but due to the high platform is wheelchair-accessible) Traintram Flexity Swift Type 1 LVR Flexity Swift T2000 Bombardier Variobahn CROTRAM TMK 2200 (NT 2200) TMK 2200 K TMK 2300 ČKD Tatra K3R-N (reconstruction with low-floor middle section) K3R-NT (reconstruction with low-floor middle section) KT8D5N (with low-floor middle section) KT8D5R.N1 (reconstruction with low-floor middle section) KT8D5R.N2 (reconstruction with low-floor middle section) KT8D5R.N2P (reconstruction with low-floor middle section) KTNF6 (reconstruction with low-floor middle section) KTNF8 (reconstruction with low-floor middle section) RT6N1 RT6N2 RT6S Satra III (reconstruction with low-floor middle section) Aliance TW Team Tatra T3R.PLF (nicknamed "wana" (Czech for 'bath') - newly built with low-floor middle section) Tatra T3R.SLF ("wana") VarioLF ("wana") VarioLF plus ("wana") VarioLF plus/o ("wana") VarioLF2 VarioLF2 plus VarioLF2/2 IN VarioLF3 VarioLF3/2 EVO1 EVO2 VV60LF (tow tramcar) Škoda Transportation 03T Astra/Anitra/Elektra 05T Vektra 06T Elektra 10T Elektra 13T Elektra 14T Elektra 15T ForCity Alfa 16T Elektra 19T Elektra 26T ForCity Classic 27T 28T ForCity Classic 29T ForCity Plus 30T ForCity Plus Artic ForCity Smart Inekon Trams 01 Trio 04 Superior 11 Pento 12 Trio Alstom ATM Class 6000 Citadis 100 Citadis 202 (on Melbourne tramway locally designated C-class) Citadis 301 Citadis 301 CIS numbers: 71-801.
