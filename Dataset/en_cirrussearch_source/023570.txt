Myrnohrad (Ukrainian: Мирногра́д, pronounced [mɪrnoˈɦrɑd]; Russian: Мирноград, romanized: Mirnograd), formerly Dymytrov (Ukrainian: Димитров, Russian: Димитров, romanized: Dimitrov), is a city of oblast significance in Donetsk Oblast (province) of Ukraine. Population: 46,098 (2022 estimate). The city was previously named after Georgi Dimitrov (Bulgarian: Георги Димитров) - a prominent Bulgarian and Soviet communist politician, but was renamed to Myrnohrad during decommunisation in May 2016. Unlike in most bigger cities in Donetsk Oblast, the separatist Donetsk People's Republic 11 May 2014 referendum on independence was not held in the city. The historical predecessors of the city of Myrnohrad were two mining settlements formed near coal mines - Novoekonomichne (1911) and Hrodivka (1916). These two settlements were built in the early twentieth century on land leased from the rural communities of Novoekonomichne and Hrodivka villages. In 1934, mine No. 5-6 (Hrodivka mine) was named after Heorhii Dymytrov. In 1966, probably as a result of prolonged heavy rains, a part of the mine 5/6 mine terricone in Myrnohrad collapsed, completely demolishing buildings on Sadova, Zhdanov, and Rozynska streets. Everyone who was in the buildings and nearby was killed. The authorities then hid the tragedy from the public. In 1972, the mining villages of Novoekonomichne and Dymytriv were united under the common name of Dymytriv. This mining town was named after the Bulgarian politician, the first president of Bulgaria, Georgi Dimitrov, in honor of his friendship with the Bulgarian people, whose representatives worked in the mines in the 1960s. In August 1990, Dimitrov was granted the status of a city of regional significance. On January 17, 2015, the city dismantled the monument to Lenin. On March 21, 2016, in accordance with the law on decommunization, Dimitrov's deputies chose a new name and voted to rename the city Myrnohrad. On May 12, 2016, the Verkhovna Rada renamed the city of Dymytriv to Myrnohrad. The relevant bill No. 4468 was voted for by 265 MPs. The renaming came into force on May 22, 2016. On February 27, 2023, during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russians launched a missile attack on the city, damaging a kindergarten.
