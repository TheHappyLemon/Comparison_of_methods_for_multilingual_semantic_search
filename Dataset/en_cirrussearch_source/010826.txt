Nordkalk is a manufacturer of limestone-based products based in Finland. It operates at more than 30 different locations in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Poland and Estonia. Limestone has been quarried in Pargas at least since the 17th century, possibly as early as the 14th century[citation needed]. Industrial quarrying began on 26 November 1898 when the joint-stock company Pargas Kalkbergs Aktiebolag was established by Otto Moberg. Pargas Kalkbergs Aktiebolag later changed its name to Partek. Nordkalk was part of Partek until February 2003. In August 2010 Rettig Group Ltd becomes the sole owner of Nordkalk. Nordkalk Corporation continues to quarry and process limestone as a member of the Rettig Group. Nordkalk is a member of Cleantech Finland.
