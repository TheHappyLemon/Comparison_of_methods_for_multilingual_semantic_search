Brian Holm Sørensen (born 2 October 1962) is a retired Danish professional rider in road bicycle racing from 1986 to 1998, who rode for Team Telekom from 1993 to 1997 and was part of the team that brought his fellow Dane Bjarne Riis to victory in the 1996 Tour de France. Brian Holm was born in Copenhagen. He was a reliable domestique for most of his career, and also sports 11 individual victories, including a national championship (1990), the one-day classic Paris–Brussels and the semi-classic Paris–Camembert. After his active career, Brian Holm has acted as a sport director, first for Danish pro-teams Team Acceptcard (1999) and Team Fakta, then for the Danish national team, and from 2003 for Team Telekom (sponsors changed several times) until 2011 when the team, latterly known as HTC-Highroad, came to an end. Holm is cited as a motivational influence on prominent HTC-Highroad cyclist, Mark Cavendish. During the 2011 UCI Road World Championships in Copenhagen, won by Cavendish, he reportedly rode in the team support car with Great Britain coach Rod Ellingworth. In February 2004 he was diagnosed with colon cancer, and underwent surgery before returning to racing. Following his experience with cancer, Holm established La Flamme Rouge, as a means to raise money for charitable organisations supporting cancer patients through sport. La Flamme Rouge sells various products such as cycle clothing designed for them by Paul Smith. Mark Cavendish is one of its ambassadors. In November 2013 Holm was elected as a municipal councillor in Frederiksberg, a town forming an enclave in the Copenhagen Municipality, despite undertaking little campaigning. Holm stood for election as a candidate of the Conservative People's Party. In May 2014 Holm was charged with indecent exposure towards a 7 year old girl, who had slept over in his house. Holm was acquitted In his 2002 autobiography, he admitted having used doping during the 1990s. This did not cost him his job as manager for the Danish national team, despite some concern about him being a role model for the young riders. In May 2007, he admitted having used erythropoietin (EPO) on two occasions in 1996 at Team Telekom. 1983 1st Duo Normand (with Jack Olsen) 7th Overall Tour of Sweden 1984 1st Grand Prix de la Ville de Lillers 4th UCI Amateur Road Race World Championships 9th Overall Tour of Norway 1986 – Roland 1st Circuit de la Frontiers Templeuve Omloop van de Grenstreek 3rd Trofeo Baracchi (with Jesper Skibby) 4th Grand Prix Pino Cerami 7th Grote Prijs Jef Scherens 1987 9th Overall Danmark Rundt 1988 2nd Grand Prix de la Libération 4th Nokere Koerse 5th Overall Danmark Rundt 1989 3rd Grand Prix de la Libération 7th Grand Prix Pino Cerami 1990 – Histor 1st  Denmark National championship, individual time trial 1st GP Wieler Revue 1st Stage 4 (TTT) Paris–Nice 1st Stage 3 Tour d'Armorique Stage 2, Tour de l'Oise 4th Grand Prix de la Libération 5th Grand Prix Eddy Merckx (with Paul Haghedooren) 6th Trofeo Luis Puig 6th Gent–Wevelgem 6th Rund um Köln 8th Grand Prix des Nations 9th Omloop Het Volk 9th Brabantse Pijl 1991 – Histor-Sigma 1st Paris–Camembert 1st Paris–Brussels 5th Grand Prix Eddy Merckx (with Benjamin Van Itterbeeck) 9th Brabantse Pijl 10th Grand Prix de la Libération 1992 2nd Omloop van de Vlaamse Scheldeboorden 4th Overall Four Days of Dunkirk 6th Grote Prijs Jef Scherens 7th Grand Prix of Aargau Canton 10th Grand Prix Eddy Merckx (with Herman Frison) 1993 5th Grand Prix de Wallonie 5th Grand Prix de Fourmies 6th Druivenkoers Overijse 6th Paris–Brussels 8th Grote 1-MeiPrijs 8th Overall Hofbräu Cup 1994 3rd Grand Prix de Denain 4th Veenendaal–Veenendaal 7th Grand Prix de Wallonie 1995 – Team Telekom Stage 6, Boland Bank International 2nd National Road Race Championships 5th Omloop Mandel 10th Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne 1996 – Team Telekom 3rd Dwars door België 5th Overall Tour de Luxembourg 6th Danish National Road Race Championships 7th Grand Prix Pino Cerami 7th Paris–Roubaix 7th Overall Danmark Rundt 1997 – Team Telekom 3rd E3 Prijs Vlaanderen 4th Grand Prix Herning 6th Overall Danmark Rundt 6th Tre Valli Varesine 7th Grand Prix Aarhus 1998 – Acceptcard Pro Cycling 1st Stage 3 Danmark Rundt 7th Danish National Road Race Championships 8th Ronde van Drenthe 8th Omloop Mandel 9th Overall Étoile de Bessèges Smerten - glæden : erindringer fra et liv på cykel, Hovedland [dk], Denmark, 2002.
