On 1 July 2009, Mačiulis signed with the Italian League team Olimpia Milano. The deal was worth €1.2 million euros net income over two years. Due to a knee injury, which prevented him from playing basketball for 9 months, Olimpia Milano did not offer him a new contract, despite his good performance before he suffered the injury. On 8 February 2012, he signed with the Lithuanian team Baltai, until he could get a better contract with another team. The deal with Baltai was worth zero LTL (he played there for free).

With that trophy, Real Madrid won the triple crown. He was also voted Lithuanian Player of the Year, for the first time in his career, in 2015, along with Gintarė Petronytė.
