Sachkhere (Georgian: საჩხერე) is a town at the northern edge of the Imereti Province in Western Georgia. It is the center of the Sachkhere Municipality. Farming is a major contributor to the economy of Sachkhere. Alva LLC estimates that there are 4,000 small and medium-sized farms and ranches in the region, supported by a program of technical assistance sponsored by USAID and administered by the Farmer-to-Farmer program of CNFA. From the end of the 15th century, much land in the region was owned by the Tsereteli noble family. By the 19th century, Sachkhere had become a very diverse settlement with a sizable community of Georgian Jews. According to official statistics published in 1880 by the administration of the viceroy, the total population of 1,034 people was composed of the following religious groups: 628 Jews, 206 Orthodox Christians, and 200 Gregorian Armenians. In 1878, 9 Georgian Jews were arrested in Sachkhere for the alleged killing of a Christian girl from the neighbouring village of Perevisi in Shorapani uezd. A classic case of blood libel, they were falsely accused of abducting the girl and extracting her blood for purportedly Jewish religious rituals. The case was decided at the Kutaisi Circuit Court in March 1879, when the defence lawyers Petr Aleksandrov and Lev Kupernik convinced the judges that the accusations were mostly based on false testimony. All of the accused were acquitted. The previous year Aleksandrov had already defended the Russian revolutionary Vera Zasulich at a highly publicised jury trial in St Petersburg, which had also resulted in an acquittal. The microbiologist George Eliava (1892-1937) was born in Sachkhere. Though small, Sachkhere is famous for having produced two Olympic weightlifting champions - Lasha Talakhadze and Giorgi Asanidze.
