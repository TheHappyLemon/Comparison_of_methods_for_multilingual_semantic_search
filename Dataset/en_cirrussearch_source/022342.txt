The 2014 UCI World Tour was the sixth edition of the ranking system launched by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 2009. The series started with the opening stage of the Tour Down Under on 21 January, and concluded with the final stage of the Tour of Beijing on 14 October. After winning the 2008 UCI ProTour, Spain's Alejandro Valverde won his first World Tour individual points title, amassing 686 points over the course of the season. The Movistar Team rider finished 66 points clear of his closest rival and compatriot Alberto Contador of Tinkoff–Saxo, while Australian rider Simon Gerrans was third for the Orica–GreenEDGE team, but was over 200 points in arrears of Valverde. In the teams' rankings, Movistar Team finished top for the second year running, with a total of 1440 points. Second place went to the BMC Racing Team after taking overall victories in two of the season's last three races, while Tinkoff–Saxo finished in third position. The nations' rankings was comfortably headed by Spain, with a points advantage of 764 over Italy. The UCI ProTeams competed in the World Tour, with UCI Professional Continental teams, or national squads, able to enter at the discretion of the organisers of each event. All events from the 2013 UCI World Tour were included. Notes As Frank rode for IAM Cycling, which is not a World Tour team, he was ineligible to score points towards the UCI World Tour standings. As Chavanel rode for IAM Cycling, which is not a World Tour team, he was ineligible to score points towards the UCI World Tour standings. As Fedi rode for Neri Sottoli, which is not a World Tour team, he was ineligible to score points towards the UCI World Tour standings. The World Team Time Trial Championship awarded points only in the team rankings, not in the individual or national standings. Riders tied with the same number of points were classified by number of victories, then number of second places, third places, and so on, in World Tour events and stages. 236 riders scored points. 43 other riders finished in positions that would have earned them points, but they were ineligible as members of non-ProTour teams. Team rankings were calculated by adding the ranking points of the top five riders of a team in the table, plus points gained in the World Team Time Trial Championship (WTTT). National rankings were calculated by adding the ranking points of the top five riders registered in a nation in the table. The national rankings were also used to determine how many riders a country could have in the World Championships. Riders from 34 countries scored points.
