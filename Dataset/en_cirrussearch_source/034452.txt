Soyuz MS-01 was a 2016 Soyuz spaceflight to the International Space Station. Originally scheduled for launch in June 2016, the mission successfully lifted off from Kazakhstan on 7 July 2016. It transported three members of the Expedition 48 crew to the International Space Station. Soyuz MS-01 is the 130th flight of a Soyuz spacecraft, and the first with the new version Soyuz MS. The crew consisted of a Russian commander, a Japanese flight engineer, and an American flight engineer. On 6 June 2016, the launch was rescheduled to July 2016 due to flaws in the control system that could affect the docking to the ISS. The spacecraft was successfully docked on 9 July 2016 and returned to Earth on 30 October 2016. Spaceflight portal "Crew Launches for Two-Day Ride to Station". NASA. 6 July 2016.
