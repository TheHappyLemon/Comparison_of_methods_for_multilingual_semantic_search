Tetritskaro or Tetritsqaro (Georgian: თეთრიწყარო, romanized: tetrits'q'aro; Georgian pronunciation: [ˈtʰetʰɾitsʼqʼaɾo], Azerbaijani: Ağbulaq) is a town in Kvemo Kartli in southern Georgia. It is the municipal center of Tetritsqaro Municipality. According to 2014 Georgian Census its population is 3,093. The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway which opened in 2017, runs along the rail line through the town. Original settlement on this location was called Garisi (გარისი), but due to invasions and wars this place got abandoned and in the beginning of the 19th century became a ghost town. Later, this area was resettled by Georgian Azerbaijanis, who called the settlement Agbulakhi; the name was of Azerbaijani origin and literally meant white spring. In 1940, the name was changed to Tetri-Tskaro, which, in Georgian, also means white spring. Town status was granted to it in 1966. Gudarekhi Kvemo Kartli "Population Census 2014". www.geostat.ge.
