He holds a personal best of 7:53.64 minutes which is the second fastest time ever run, and the African Record. His personal best is only 0.01 of a second behind the world record of former county mate Saif Saaeed Shaheen, who switched national affiliation to Qatar after growing up as Stephen Cherono in the Keiyo District. He won a silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics at the age of nineteen and improved to win the gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics four years later. A World Championships bronze medallist in 2005, he took his first global title in the steeplechase with a win at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics. At the 2001 World Youth Championships in Athletics in Debrecen, Hungary he finished second in steeplechase. He graduated from Kipsoen Secondary School in 2003.

At the 2004 World Junior Championships in Athletics he competed in the 1500m instead of steeplechase and finished third.
