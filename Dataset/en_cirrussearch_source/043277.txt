Živković was a vital member of the Serbia national under-20 team that won the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup, scoring two goals and providing two assists. Živković joined Partizan in September 2009. He was a member of the club's promising generation, alongside Danilo Pantić and Nemanja Radonjić, among others. Živković made his competitive debut for their first team in a league fixture against Novi Pazar on 28 April 2013, replacing Darko Brašanac after 65 minutes of the match that ended in a goalless draw. That was his only appearance in the 2012–13 campaign, as the club won its sixth consecutive championship title. After a long negotiation, Živković signed his first professional contract with Partizan on 23 August 2013, on a three-year deal. He scored his first competitive goal for the club only two days later, after coming on as a substitute for Nikola Ninković in a 5–1 home victory over Radnički Kragujevac. Afterwards, Živković scored a goal in the next three league games, in a 3–1 home win over Rad, in a 2–1 away win against Sloboda Užice, as well as in a 2–0 home victory over OFK Beograd. On 4 March 2014, Živković became Partizan's youngest captain of all-time at 17 years, 7 months and 18 days. This honour was previously held by Nikola Ninković, who captained the team at 17 years, 10 months and 12 days. In his first full senior season, Živković made a total of 25 appearances in all competitions and scored five goals. In his third senior season, Živković played regularly since the beginning of the campaign, despite being unable to score in any competition. He also appeared in five games of the UEFA Europa League group stage. After failing to find the back of the net for several months, he scored his first goal of the season in a 5–1 home league win over Borac Čačak on 7 December 2014. He improved his tally after the winter break by scoring four more league goals, including a brace in a 3–1 away victory over OFK Beograd on 13 April 2015. In total, Živković made 40 appearances in all competitions and scored seven goals, as the club won the championship title.

He subsequently scored a brace in a 3–1 away win against Augsburg on 1 October. In the fifth round of the group stage, Živković continued his goal scoring form, netting the winning goal against AZ in a 2–1 away victory on 26 November. On 4 February 2016, Živković was suspended from the first team for refusing to extend his contract with the club. On 5 July 2016, Živković signed a five-year deal with Portuguese champions S.L.

Živković played his first Benfica match of the 2017–18 season against Rio Ave. On 8 September 2020, PAOK announced the signing of Živković on a free transfer. The 24-year-old Serbian international was previously released by Benfica as part of their summer overhaul and PAOK snapped him up on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee.
