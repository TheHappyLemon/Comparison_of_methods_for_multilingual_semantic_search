Screen Actors Guild Awards (also known as SAG Awards) are accolades given by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA). The award was founded in 1995 to recognize outstanding performances in movie and prime time television. SAG Awards have been one of the major awards events in the Hollywood film industry since then, along with the Golden Globe Awards and the Oscars. SAG awards focus both on individual performances and on the work of the entire ensemble of a drama series and comedy series, and the cast of a motion picture. Nominations for the awards come from two committees, one for film and one for television, each numbering 2,100 members of the union, randomly selected anew each year, with the full membership (165,000 as of 2012) available to vote for the winners. It is considered an indicator of success at the Academy Awards in acting categories. The awards have been telecast on TNT from 1998 to 2022, and have been simulcast on TBS from 2007 to 2022. In May 2022 it was announced that both TNT and TBS will no longer air the awards. In January 2023, it was announced that Netflix will air the awards live beginning in 2024 as part of a new multi-year partnership, with the 2023 ceremony being announced to be live streamed on Netflix's YouTube channel as Netflix was still working out its live streaming capabilities at the time of the announcement. The inaugural SAG Awards aired live on February 25, 1995, from Universal Studios' Stage 12. The second SAG awards aired live from the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, while subsequent awards have been held at the Shrine Auditorium. On December 4, 2017, it was announced that the awards show would have its first host in its then twenty-four year history, with actress Kristen Bell presiding over the ceremony. As of 2023, Shakespeare in Love is the only film to receive nominations for all four acting categories and the ensemble award and Everything Everywhere All at Once is the only film to receive four awards, including the ensemble award. The statuette given, a nude male figure holding both a mask of comedy and a mask of tragedy, is called "The Actor". It is 16 inches (41 cm) tall, weighs over 12 pounds (5.4 kg), is cast in solid bronze, and produced by the American Fine Arts Foundry in Burbank, California. 1995: 1st Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 1994 1996: 2nd Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 1995 1997: 3rd Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 1996 1998: 4th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 1997 1999: 5th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 1998 2000: 6th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 1999 2001: 7th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2000 2002: 8th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2001 2003: 9th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2002 2004: 10th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2003 2005: 11th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2004 2006: 12th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2005 2007: 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2006 2008: 14th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2007 2009: 15th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2008 2010: 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2009 2011: 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2010 2012: 18th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2011 2013: 19th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2012 2014: 20th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2013 2015: 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2014 2016: 22nd Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2015 2017: 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2016 2018: 24th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2017 2019: 25th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2018 2020: 26th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2019 2021: 27th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2020 2022: 28th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2021 2023: 29th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2022 2024: 30th Screen Actors Guild Awards, for the year 2023 Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role in a Motion Picture Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role in a Motion Picture Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Comedy or Drama Series Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award (Minimum of 3 wins) (Minimum of 10 nominations) Note: Winners are indicated in bold type.
