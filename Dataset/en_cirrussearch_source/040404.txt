Since its inception in 1949, the club Hapoel Be'er Sheva has played in 3 different plots, starting out playing on the soil surface at the stadium which was located in the old city. In 1959, the municipal stadium was built and inaugurated in Be'er Sheva on 31 October 1959 in a Hapoel Be'er Sheva game against Hapoel Tel Aviv. December 1988 ended in a major overhaul of the stadium, the contribution of Mrs. Lilly Friedman-Vasermil, and the stadium was named for Arthur Vasermil. Ms. Friedman-Vasermil perpetuated the name of her son, who was murdered in the Holocaust by the Nazis, in 1943, Majdanek extermination camp, at the age of seven. In 1995, in honor of her portrayal of Hapoel Be'er Sheva in front of a Barcelona UEFA Cup group, the stadium was renovated and plastic seats were installed at the bleachers instead of exposed concrete. In 2009 the rest of the seats were installed in the galleries, following the return of Hapoel Be'er Sheva Premier League. On 30 May 2015 the last game was played in Vasermil Stadium, which increased Hapoel Be'er Sheva 4–0 on the team Beitar Jerusalem. On 16 September 2015, Turner Stadium opened for the first time to some 4,000 fans who watched the team public show practice. The first game hosted by the stadium took place on 21 September 2015 against Maccabi Haifa, and ended with a 0–0 draw. Before the game there was a dedication ceremony for a house and the setting of mezuzot in the presence of Mayor Rubik Danilovich. Be'er Sheva Municipality decided during 2015 to commemorate the legendary stadium named Arthur Vasermil that carries on a meaningful story. This compound serves mainly the youth department groups Hapoel Be'er Sheva, but sometimes even the older group. Compound five training facilities include a field with artificial turf as required by FIFA. In 2013 the building was inaugurated "at the Association". The project includes 750 square meters of computer rooms, professional spaces, dressing rooms, doctor's room, coaches room, an area for gatherings, logistics and other rooms with modern elements of the most advanced in the country and meets all the standards of the Israel Football Association Premier leagues. There is a possibility of building another floor to the club in the future, to continue activities such as a football academy construction project. Hapoel Be'er Sheva fans spread throughout the country and are one of the largest audiences in Israel. The 2012–13 season fans won the title of Be'er Sheva year's fair audience. UltraSouth was founded in 2014 out of a union between 2 groups – The Camels 2005 & and The South Side. Its activity was centered in Gate 5 at Vasermil Stadium. At Turner Stadium it runs behind the gate in the south gallery. The organization focuses on encouraging the group and preparing a stage for the games. In addition, the organization helps organize the fans of the group in ways of reaching out. Since the group moved to Turner Stadium, the organization has begun to present advanced sets of encouragement. In the 2016–17 season, the fans organization launched a fundraising campaign to purchase crankshafts for the southern pavilion to assist in the layout of the sets. The sum they sought to reach was 100,000 Shekels and the end of the campaign was about a month, but after 24 hours the money was raised in full. The organization advocated political isolation and the ultras of "ULTRAS NO POLITICA". The approach of the UltraSouth organization to avoid political affiliation turned out to be successful. After the display of Palestinian flags in Celtic Park, the organization emphasized that anyone who wanted to bring the Israeli flag to the tour was welcome, but it would not be related to the group. The organization takes care to make flags and signs in high-level deployment to increase the standard of decor in the stands. There is a songwriter for the group and for the players. In addition, the organization is in regular contact with the fans through Facebook, a dedicated Telegram channel, and other social media. With the establishment of the club, it was decided by the management team that a crest, labeled below with Hapoel Be'er Sheva, would be placed on jerseys. This symbol has served the club until 1993. In 1993 the club management decided to change the group crest, and because over the years the club had earned the nickname "Camel", the club tried to create a symbol for it. Between 1993 and 1995 the crest had a modified camel hump below, a soccer ball in the center circle, and the team name written in Hebrew and English at the edges. From 1995 to 2016, Hapoel Be'er Sheva flaunted symbol whose lower half was a soccer ball, and the top half contained a chimney that symbolizes the municipal building, a symbol of the original executive, and the slogan "the pride of the Negev" to describe the team from the capital of the Negev. On 21 June 2016 the club's management presented the official emblem at the 2016–17 season press conference. The current symbol is based on the symbol that served the club from the 1995–96 season to the 2015–16 season: the lower half circle shape is half a soccer ball, the top half contains a chimney symbolizing the municipal building, a symbol of the original executive, and the top edges of the circle display the club's Hebrew and English name. In addition, the crest is displayed below a star; this star represents that the club has won five championships. The shirt and shorts of Hapoel Be'er Sheva have been red and white since its inception; the group's third costume is blue. At some point in time, the team has added a rather black color. During the 1990s, the team also played in costumes that are not related to their traditional colors, such as a purple outfit, which represents the forum club that was then the main sponsor. The club's famous uniforms are red and white striped shirts, the first and second championship seasons. The uniform of the team beginning with the 2019–20 season are made by the Kelme company. Over the years, Hapoel Be'er Sheva has used uniforms from Kappa, Adidas, Nike, Diadora, Lotto, Puma and Umbro. Here are the manufacturers of team uniforms starting in 1975: Since its inception Hapoel Be'er Sheva has worked with a number of sponsors recognized locally as Solel Boneh in the 1980s, and the South Korean car company Kia and Forum Club at the beginning and middle of the decade.

Deinner Quiñones André Poko Imran Oulad Omar Hélder Lopes Antonio Sefer Last updated:30 August 2023 Hapoel "Hashlosha" Be'er Sheva, which represents the country's main southern football, and one of the largest youth departments in Israel. During most of the club's years, the club enjoys a strong youth department. Until 1969 Hapoel Be'er Sheva had one youth team, and it even won the first Israeli Youth Championship this year. At the end of the championship season, another group, Hapoel "Hashlosha", was established in Be'er Sheva after three employees of the "Makhteshim" factory who died in a work accident. The "Hashlosha" coach was Chaim Sne and within a short time the "Hashlosha" became the senior youth group in the city. "Hashlosha" won the first Israeli youth championship in 1973–74. Until the end of the 1980s Hapoel "HaShlosha" Be'er Sheva was regularly ranked in the top ranks of the Youth Super League and even won four State Youth Championships. From the mid-1960s, Hapoel Be'er Sheva youth teams relied on the talents discovered in the municipal youth leagues, founded by Aharon Ben Yaakov, who in their heyday numbered thousands of boys who played in hundreds of teams. As the group moved into private hands in the 1990s, the investment in the youth department declined and the youth group dropped to the re-election after a few years. Since 2007, when Alona Barkat has purchased the club, many funds have been invested to bring the youth departments back to the forefront, and in recent years the youth group has gradually returned to the top of the youth league. Professional director of the Youth Department: Shmulik Hanin Youth Israeli champions: Winners (4): 1969–70, 1973–74, 1975–76, 1984–85 Youth Super Cup: Winners (1): 1984–85 The title character of the Israeli sitcom Shemesh, is a devoted supporter of the club, and the club appears in the show's main setting and is mentioned several times throughout the show.
