Havlíčkův Brod (Czech pronunciation: [ˈɦavliːtʃkuːv ˈbrot], until 1945 Německý Brod; German: Deutschbrod) is a town in Havlíčkův Brod District in the Vysočina Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 23,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone. The villages of Březinka, Herlify, Jilemník, Klanečná, Květnov, Mírovka, Poděbaby, Šmolovy, Suchá, Svatý Kříž, Termesivy, Veselice and Zbožice are administrative parts of Havlíčkův Brod. Jilemník and Zbožice form two exclaves of the municipal territory. The Czech word brod means "ford". The town was firstly named Brod and then Smilův Brod ("Smil's Ford") after its founder Smil of Lichtenburk. In the 14th century it was renamed Německý Brod ("German Ford") because of its predominantly German population. Because of Anti-German sentiment after World War II, the town was renamed Havlíčkův Brod ("Havlíček's Ford") in honor of the writer Karel Havlíček Borovský, who was born nearby and grew up and studied in the town. It was the very first town out of many to be renamed in 1945. Havlíčkův Brod is located roughly in the geographical centre of the country. It is located about 21 kilometres (13 mi) north of Jihlava. It lies in the Upper Sázava Hills. The Sázava River flows through the town. Many smaller tributaries of the Sázava flows through the municipal territory: Cihlářský potok, Žabinec, Šlapanka with Stříbrný potok, Úsobský potok, Rozkošský potok, and Břevnický potok. There are systems of fishponds supplied by some of these watercourses. Several ponds on the Cihlářský potok are located in the urban area. The largest pond of Cihlářský potok is Cihlář Pond, which serves also recreational purposes and water sports. The largest water body in the municipal territory is the Žabinec water reservoir, supplied by the eponymous stream. According to a legend recorded by chronicler Wenceslaus Hajek, Brod was founded in 793, however, this year is highly unlikely. The first written mention of a settlement called Brod is from 1234, but it is referred to as probable counterfeit. The first credible mention of Brod is from 1265. The town was founded by Smil of Lichtenburk probably in 1251 on a trade route. In 1308, it was first called Německý Brod. Brod was first an important mining town focused on silver mining, later it became a centre of crafts and agricultural production. During the Hussite Wars in 1422 as a result of Battle of Německý Brod, Brod was conquered by Jan Žižka and completely destroyed. The town was resettled by predominantly Czech-speaking population. In 1436, it was bought by the Trčka of Lípa family. Brod was renewed and in the 16th and 17th centuries, it prospered. In 1637, it became a royal town. The prosperity ended with the Thirty Years' War. Brod was twice conquered and looted. In 1646, 1664 and 1680, the town was affected by plague epidemics. In 1662 and 1676, it was damaged by large fires. The most devastating flood hit the town in 1714. During the 19th century, economical and cultural development occurred. In 1850, Brod became a district town. Brod was industrialized in the second half of the 19th century with an emphasis on textile and food industry. The railway was built in 1870 and the station later became an important hub. Until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary, head of the Deutschbrod – Německý Brod District, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia. In Havlíčkův Brod there are medical hospital and mental hospital. Both are among the main employers in the town. The main industrial employers based in the town are Futaba Czech s.r.o., a manufacturer of car parts, and Pleas a.s., a producer of underwear founded in 1939 which continues the long tradition of the textile industry in the town. The Havlíčkův Brod Brewery is based in the town. It was founded in 1834. Havlíčkův Brod is both road and railway hub. There are five rail lines leading off the main station: to Kolín and Prague, to Pardubice, to Brno, to Jihlava and a local lines to Humpolec and to Ledeč nad Sázavou. In addition to the main station, the municipal territory is served by four other train stops: Havlíčkův Brod-Perknov, Mírovka, Pohledští Dvořáci and Dolík. The town is a crossing of two major Czech roads, I/34 from České Budějovice to Svitavy and I/38 from Mladá Boleslav to Jihlava, Znojmo and the Czech-Austrian border. There is the small Havlíčkův Brod Airport near the town. It serves mainly for sport and sightseeing flying. The historic centre was delimited by town fortifications. Several fragments are preserved to this day. In the centre is the Havlíčkovo Square. It is lined by valuable burgher houses in Renaissance and Baroque styles, some of them with preserved Gothic elements. The landmark of the square is the Old Town Hall.
