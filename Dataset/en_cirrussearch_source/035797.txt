Linda Elin Ulvaeus (born 23 February 1973) is a Swedish actress and singer. She is the elder child of Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog, members of the pop group ABBA. Ulvaeus is the only daughter of Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog. She was born in Danderyd Hospital in Danderyd. Her younger brother, Peter Christian Ulvaeus, was born on 4 December 1977. Ulvaeus made her musical debut in 1981 at the age of eight, releasing the album she recorded alongside her mother the previous year, Nu tändas tusen juleljus ("Now a thousand Christmas candles are lit"). The album, which was produced by Fältskog alongside Michael B. Tretow, consisted of 18 traditional Christmas carols and children's songs in Swedish. Although the album had been recorded in November 1980 (when Ulvaeus was seven years old), it was not released until the following October. She is the inspiration behind the song "Slipping Through My Fingers", written by her father and recorded by her parents' band ABBA. Ulvaeus has since established herself as a stage and screen actress. Her acting debut came in the film Under solen (1998) in the role of Lena. She then appeared in the television series Labyrinten in 2000. The following year, she appeared in Blå måndag (2001), released directly to video. Ulvaeus was a backing vocalist on her mother's 2004 comeback single, "When You Walk in the Room", which reached #11 in Sweden. Ulvaeus returned to the big screen in the role of Sofia in the film Meningen med alltihopa (2006). She later appeared in the television series Playa del Sol in 2007. Ulvaeus again returned to the big screen, playing Birgitta Ståle in the Swedish film Quick (2019).
