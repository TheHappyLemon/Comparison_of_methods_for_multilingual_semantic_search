Port Moresby International Airport (IATA: POM, ICAO: AYPY), also known as Jacksons International Airport, is an international airport located eight kilometres (four nautical miles) outside Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. It is the largest and busiest airport in Papua New Guinea, with an estimated 1.4 million passengers using the airport in 2015, and is the main hub for Air Niugini, the national airline of Papua New Guinea. The airport serves as the main hub for PNG Air and Travel Air. It replaced the original Port Moresby airport, in what is now the suburb of Waigani, whose airstrip remained until the 1990s but no trace of which remains, having been built over. Jacksons International Airport consists of two terminals: the Domestic Terminal, housing Air Niugini and PNG Air, and the International Terminal, servicing all other international airlines including Air Niugini's and PNG Air's international routes. The International Terminal features four aircraft parking bays, four of which are equipped with aerobridges. The two terminals are linked by a covered walkway. Air Niugini has its head office in the Air Niugini House, near the airport property.
