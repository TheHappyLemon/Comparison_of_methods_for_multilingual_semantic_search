Women's synchronized 3 metre springboard competition at the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics was held on 10 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center. As in all other synchronized diving competitions at the Olympics, a single round of competition was held. Eight pairs of divers competed. Each pair performed five dives, with both divers from the pair jumping at the same time. Nine judges evaluated each dive, with two each judging the performance of the two divers (the execution judges) and five judges evaluating the synchronization of the pair (the synchronization judges). For each dive, four of the nine scores are ignoredâ€”the highest and lowest execution scores, and the highest and lowest synchronization scores. The remaining five scores are summed, multiplied by the dive's degree of difficulty, and then multiplied by 0.6 to get the final score for the dive.
