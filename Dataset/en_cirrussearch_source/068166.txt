Damian Dawid Szymański (born 16 June 1995) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Greek Super League club AEK Athens and the Poland national team. Szymański started his career with GKS Bełchatów. On 12 January 2019, Wisła Płock announced his transfer to the Russian Premier League club FC Akhmat Grozny. Three days later Akhmat confirmed that the club signed a 4.5-year contract with Szymański. On 13 January 2020, Szymański travelled to Athens to pass his medicals and complete a move to AEK Athens. The Polish midfielder will join the Greek club on an initial six-month loan, and AEK will maintain the right to buy him for a fee of €1,500,000. One day later, the deal was made official and Szymański was presented by his new club. On 30 June 2020, Szymański penned a four-year deal with AEK after his transfer from Akhmat Grozny was made permanent. The Greek club paid €1,300,000 for his services, while Akhmat will keep a resale rate of 15%. Five days later, Szymanski scored his first goal for the club, sealing an emphatic 4–1 away win against Aris Thessaloniki. On 20 January 2021, he scored helping to a 2–0 home win against Apollon Smyrnis for the first leg of the Greek Cup round of 16. On 15 February 2021, he sealed a dramatic 4–2 away win against AEL, after a low cross from Levi García. The following week, Szymański scored a brace in a 2–2 home draw against Asteras Tripolis. On 5 December 2021, he was the only scorer in a vital 1–0 home win against rivals Panathinaikos. At the start of the 2022–23 season, the appointment of Matías Almeyda as the club's new coach helped Damian to revive his career, eventually receiving a call-up for the 2022 World Cup. He also became the team's second captain, behind Sergio Araujo. The Argentine coach managed to harness his athleticism and passion, making him a significant member of the team, thus attracting interest from various clubs including Standard Liège. On 20 April 2023, Szymański signed a new contract with AEK Athens, running until the summer of 2027. Szymański made his Poland national team debut on 7 September 2018 in a 2018–19 UEFA Nations League A game against Italy. He made his first start for Poland in the return game against Italy on 14 October. He scored his first goal, an equaliser in the injury time of the second half, on 8 September 2021 in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against England held at the National Stadium in Warsaw, which ended in a 1–1 draw.
