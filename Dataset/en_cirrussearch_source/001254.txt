Ross Island (77°30′S 168°00′E﻿ / ﻿77.500°S 168.000°E﻿ / -77.500; 168.000) is an island in Antarctica lying on the east side of McMurdo Sound and extending 43 nautical miles (80 km; 49 mi) from Cape Bird on the north to Cape Armitage on the south, and a like distance from Cape Royds on the west to Cape Crozier on the east. The island is entirely volcanic. Mount Erebus, 3,795 metres (12,451 ft), near the center, is an active volcano. Mount Terror, 3,230 metres (10,600 ft), about 20 nautical miles (37 km; 23 mi) eastward, is an extinct volcano. Mount Bird rises to 1,765 metres (5,791 ft) just south of Cape Bird. Ross Island lies within the boundary of Ross Dependency, an area of Antarctica claimed by New Zealand. This area was discovered by Sir James Clark Ross in 1841, but he thought it formed part of the mainland of Victoria Land. It was determined to be an island and named by the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901-04), led by Robert Falcon Scott, for Sir James Clark Ross. Ross Island was the base for many of the early expeditions to Antarctica. It is the southernmost island reachable by sea. Huts built by Scott's and Shackleton's expeditions are still standing on the island, preserved as historical sites. Today Ross Island is home to New Zealand's Scott Base and to the largest Antarctic settlement, the United States Antarctic Program's McMurdo Station. Greenpeace established World Park Base on the island and ran it for five years, from 1987 to 1992. Because of the persistent presence of the ice sheet, the island is sometimes taken to be part of the Antarctic mainland. Only a small portion of the island is free of ice and snow. Its area is 2,460 square kilometres (950 sq mi). Despite its relatively small size, Ross Island is the world's 6th highest island and the highest island in Antarctica. It has the highest average elevation of any island.[citation needed] Major volcanic peaks include, from west to east, Mount Bird, Mount Erebus, Mount Terra Nova and Mount Terror. Mount Erebus is (3,794 metres (12,448 ft)) is the planet's southernmost active volcano. The dormant volcano Mount Terror (3,230 metres (10,600 ft)), is the second highest on the island. They were named by Captain James Ross after his ships HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. The third highest elevation is Mount Bird, with Shell Glacier and Endeavour Piedmont Glacier on its slopes. The Erebus hotspot is thought to be responsible for the island's volcanic activity. The base of the Hut Point Peninsula is home to McMurdo Station and Scott Base. Scott's Hut is further north on the west coast, at Cape Evans. North of this at Cape Royds is Shackleton's Hut. Finally, the Cape Bird Hut is just south of Cape Bird. McMurdo Station, established in 1955, is the largest station in Antarctica. It provides logistic support to the United States Antarctic Program. It has a harbor, landing strips, about 85 buildings including large three story structures, a power plant, warehouses and other infrastructure. Scott Base was established on Pram Point by New Zealand in 1957 as a permanent base supporting scientific researchers who visit Antarctica in the summer. The area under roof is about 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). Scott’s hut at Cape Evans was the base for Robert Falcon Scott’s British Antarctic (Terra Nova) Expedition 1910–1913. It was built in January 1911 on a beach of volcanic scoria on the north-west side of Cape Evans. The Antarctic Heritage Trust has restored the hut and now maintains it. Shackleton's Hut at Cape Royds is a prefabricated timber hut built in London in 1907 for Ernest Shackleton’s British Antarctic (Nimrod) Expedition 1907–1909. It was disassembled, then rebuilt on site, and used by the expedition for 14 months. Cape Bird Hut was a six-person shelter built at New Zealand's Scott Base in 1966 and taken by helicopter to Cape Bird. It was rebuilt in 1991, can house eight people, and has a kitchen with a propane stove and diesel-powered central heating. Capes and peninsulas include, clockwise from the south, the Hut Point Peninsula, Cape Evans, Cape Royds, Cape Bird, Cape Tennyson, Cape Crozier and Cape MacKay. Hut Point Peninsula is a long, narrow peninsula from 2 to 3 nautical miles (3.7 to 5.6 km; 2.3 to 3.5 mi) wide and 15 nautical miles (28 km; 17 mi) long, projecting south-west from the slopes of Mount Erebus. Cape Evans is a rocky cape on the west side of Ross Island, forming the north side of the entrance to Erebus Bay. Cape Royds is a dark rock cape forming the western extremity of Ross Island, facing on McMurdo Sound. Cape Bird marks the north extremity of Ross Island. Cape Tennyson is a rock cape on the north coast of Ross Island, about 25 nautical miles (46 km; 29 mi) southeast of Cape Bird. Cape Crozie is the most easterly point of Ross Island. Cape MacKay is an ice-covered cape which forms the southeast extremity of Ross Island. Large bays include Erebus Bay, Wohlschlag Bay, Lewis Bay and Windless Bight. Erebus Bay is about 13 nautical miles (24 km; 15 mi) wide between Cape Evans and Hut Point Peninsula, on the west side of Ross Island. Wohlschlag Bay is a large bay indenting the west side of Ross Island between Harrison Bluff and Cape Royds. Lewis Bay is a bay indenting the north coast of Ross Island between Mount Bird and Cape Tennyson. Windless Bight is the prominent bight indenting the south side of Ross Island eastward of Hut Point Peninsula. Major glaciers entering the sea or ice cap around the island include, clockwise from the south, Erebus Glacier and the Erebus Glacier Tongue, Barne Glacier, Shell Glacier, Terror Glacier and Aurora Glacier. Erebus Glacier is a glacier draining the lower southern slopes of Mount Erebus. It flows west to Erebus Bay where it forms the floating Erebus Glacier Tongue. Shell Glacier is a western lobe of the Mount Bird icecap. It descends steeply in the valley north of Trachyte Hill and Harrison Bluff in the center of the ice-free area on the lower western slopes of Mount Bird. Barne Glacier is a steep glacier which descends from the west slopes of Mount Erebus and terminates on the west side of Ross Island between Cape Barne and Cape Evans where it forms a steep ice cliff. Terror Glacier is a large glacier between Mount Terra Nova and Mount Terror, flowing south into Windless Bight. Aurora Glacier is a large glacier draining that part of Ross Island between Mount Erebus and Mount Terra Nova, and flowing south into McMurdo Ice Shelf.
