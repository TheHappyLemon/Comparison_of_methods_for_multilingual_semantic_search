Producer Kelly Souders said they knew Durance was Lois for the series after seeing her casting tape, "there were a lot of wonderful actresses who came in for the role but I remember the entire writing staff watching her tape and just saying, that's her.

She was promoted to series regular in season five and became part of the Smallville cast. "Everyone has their specific idea of who Lois Lane is for them, and you have your overall blueprint, but then you have to try to make it your own. That's the only way to try to stay truthful to what you're doing," Durance on playing Lois Lane.
