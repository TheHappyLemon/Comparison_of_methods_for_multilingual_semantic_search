In just 14 moves he sacrificed both his rooks and his queen to finish with Boden's mate. Canal wrote "Strategia di Avamposti" (Outpost Strategy) in 1948, in which he explains his ideas with 50 games commented in his colorful style. It contains games with players such as Capablanca, Nimzovitch, Rubinstein, Vidmar, Reti, Pirc, Saemisch, Menchik, Lilienthal, Bogoljubov, and other greats of the time. From 1962 to 1978, Esteban Canal also kept a chess column in the Italian magazine "Fenarete Letture d'Italia". Canal played in one Chess Olympiad, representing Peru on board 1 in 1950 at Dubrovnik. FIDE made him an International Master in 1950 and an honorary Grandmaster in 1977. Canal, Esteban (2017) [1962–1978].
