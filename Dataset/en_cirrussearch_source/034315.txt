Manuel Agudo Durán (Spanish pronunciation: [maˈnwel aˈɣuðo ðuˈɾan]; born 15 October 1986), known as Nolito ([noˈlito]), is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a winger or a forward. Having begun his career at lower league clubs he signed for Barcelona in 2008, playing predominantly with its reserves. He totalled 243 games and 60 goals in La Liga, where he also represented Granada, Celta and Sevilla. Abroad, he played two seasons for Benfica in Portugal, and one in the English Premier League with Manchester City. Nolito made his debut for Spain in November 2014, representing the nation at Euro 2016. Born in Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Cádiz, Andalusia, Nolito began his career with UD Algaida in his hometown before joining Atlético Sanluqueño in 2000. He made his first-team debut in Tercera División with the latter club at the age of just 15, scoring on his debut, and moved to Valencia in 2003, where he wrapped up his formative years. Nolito returned to Sanluqueño in 2005, and was their top scorer in the 2005–06 season with 27 goals (24 in the regular season). He then signed with Écija of the Segunda División B, where he scored in a 1–1 home draw against Real Madrid in the 2006–07 Copa del Rey. Nolito arrived at Barcelona's youth academy at nearly 22 years of age, after scoring 13 times for Écija the previous campaign. With the Catalans' B team, also in the third tier, he scored 16 league goals over two seasons – 12 in the second– as the side returned to the Segunda División after an 11-year absence. On 3 October 2010, Nolito made his La Liga debut for Barcelona, coming on as a substitute for Pedro in a 1–1 home draw against Mallorca. On 10 November, he opened the 5–1 home win over Ceuta in the round of 32 of the Copa del Rey (7–1 on aggregate). In late May 2011, Nolito rejected Barcelona's offer of a professional contract and instead signed a five-year deal with Portuguese club Benfica, effective as of 1 July. He scored on his official debut on the 27th, a 2–0 home win against Trabzonspor in the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round. He also netted in the second leg, a 1–1 draw. On 20 August 2011, Nolito scored once in a 3–1 home victory over Feirense, making him alongside Eusébio the only player to score in his first five official matches. He managed 15 goals in 48 competitive appearances in his first season, helping his team to win the Taça da Liga. Nolito returned to his country and his native region on 29 January 2013, being loaned to Granada for six months and a fee of €600,000, without the possibility of making the move permanent in June. In his first match, four days after signing, he took the corner which resulted in Cristiano Ronaldo's own goal for the game's only, giving Granada their first win over Real Madrid in 40 years. Nolito signed with Celta de Vigo on 1 July 2013, penning a four-year deal and reuniting with former Barcelona B boss Luis Enrique. He finished his debut campaign as team top scorer with 14. Nolito was named La Liga Player of the Month for September 2014, with four goals during a month which ended with the side in sixth position. He created 96 goalscoring opportunities over the campaign, the most in the Spanish league and fourth most in Europe's five leading leagues. On 23 September 2015, Nolito took his league tally to five after scoring once and providing two assists for Iago Aspas in a 4–1 home defeat of former club Barcelona. He totalled three goals and an assist that month to help them remain unbeaten, earning him a second Player of the Month accolade. In mid-December, however, he suffered a hamstring injury against Espanyol which sidelined him for two months. Nolito returned to action on 20 February 2016, featuring roughly 20 minutes in a 3–2 home win over Eibar. In the following round, he scored the game's only goal at Getafe, and Celta eventually finished in sixth place.
