Jakub Zbořil (born 21 February 1997) is a Czech professional ice hockey defenceman for the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected by the Boston Bruins in the first round, 13th overall, at the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Zbořil was drafted by the Saint John Sea Dogs in the first round, fifth overall, of the 2014 CHL Import Draft. His outstanding play with the Sea Dogs during the 2014–15 season was recognized when he was named to the 2014–15 QMJHL All-Rookie Team. Leading up to the 2015 NHL Entry Draft on 26 June 2015, Zbořil was named as a top-rated prospect and was widely projected to be a first round selection at the draft. He was ultimately selected by the Boston Bruins with the 13th overall pick, acquired from the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Milan Lucic, one of three consecutive first-round selections by the Bruins, along with Jake DeBrusk (14th overall) and Zachary Senyshyn (15th overall). On 15 July, Zbořil signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Bruins. It would not be until the 2018–19 season, with a depleted defensive corps at the time, that Zbořil would play his first NHL game with the Bruins. Zbořil made his NHL debut on 16 November 2018, in a 1–0 overtime loss to the Dallas Stars. However, he only appeared in two games for the Bruins that year before returning to the minors. On 8 September 2020, with the North American season to be delayed, Zbořil was loaned by the Bruins to join Czech Extraliga club, HC Kometa Brno, to begin the 2020–21 season until the commencement of the Bruins training camp. While on loan with Brno, Zbořil as a restricted free agent with the Bruins, was signed to a two-year, $1.45 million extension on 14 October 2020. He appeared in his third game with the Bruins in the delayed season opener on 14 January 2021, against the New Jersey Devils.[citation needed] On 23 January, Zbořil recorded his first NHL point, an assist, in a 6–1 win against the Philadelphia Flyers. Throughout the shortened season, Zbořil was in-and-out of the Bruins lineup. In 42 total games, he had nine assists. For the first time in his NHL career, Zbořil made the Bruins opening night roster to start the 2021–22 season. Although he started off as the team's seventh defenceman, once again going in-and-out of the lineup, by the Thanksgiving break, Zbořil had played himself into a regular role in the Bruins' starting lineup. Unfortunately, he was injured on 2 December 2021, in a game against the Nashville Predators. It was later revealed that he had suffered a torn ACL, and would miss the rest of the season. He finished the season with three assists in 10 games. Coming off his injury season, Zbořil once again made the opening night roster for the Bruins to start the 2022–23 season, and once again served as the team's seventh defenceman. However, unlike the prior year, he was unable to play himself into a regular role in the lineup. On 12 November 2022, Zbořil scored his first NHL goal in a 3–1 win over the Buffalo Sabres, which ended up being the game-winner. It would be his only goal of the season, and he would add three assists for a total of four points in 22 games during the season. Zbořil did not make the NHL roster to start the 2023–24 season, and on 7 October 2023, he was waived by the Bruins. After clearing waivers, he reported to Boston's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Providence Bruins, where he had not played since the 2019–20 season. On 13 December, the Bruins announced that they had placed Zbořil on waivers again in order to accommodate his request to play for another organization. He cleared once again, and continued playing for Providence.[citation needed] On 8 March 2024, unable to find success in the Bruins organization, Zbořil was traded along with a 2027 third-round pick to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Andrew Peeke. He was subsequently assigned the Blue Jackets' AHL affiliate, the Cleveland Monsters. "Dogs select Czech d-man 5th overall". stationnation.ca. 2 July 2014. Retrieved 2 July 2014.
