Paulo Sérgio Silvestre do Nascimento (born 2 June 1969), commonly known as Paulo Sérgio, is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a forward. Whilst at German club Bayern Munich, he won the Champions League in 2001. Paulo Sérgio rose to prominence at Corinthians, where he was a key player in the early 1990s. In 1993, he was signed by Bayer Leverkusen, where he played for four seasons. His form was good enough for him to be included in the Brazil national team, although he was not among the top scorers of Bundesliga. He was rated as a top class second striker. In 1997, Paulo Sérgio was bought by Italian club Roma, where he played for two seasons. He formed an effective striking partnership with the emerging Francesco Totti and Marco Delvecchio, scoring 22 goals in 57 league appearances. When Roma signed Vincenzo Montella from relegated Sampdoria in 1999, he moved on. FC Bayern Munich became his new employer, and in his three years at Bayern, he won both Champions League and Bundesliga, his finest club honours. In 2002, Bayern signed several new players, and Paulo Sérgio was no longer in the first team plans, prompting him to move to Al Wahda in Abu Dhabi, before finishing his career back in Bahia in his native Brazil. He started his coaching career at Red Bull Brasil in 2008. On the team, he worked with another former idol of the Corinthians: Gilmar Fubá. He was the presenter and judge of the Menino de Ouro (en:Golden Boy) reality show, shown by the SBT between 2013 and 2014. He was also Sports Secretary of the Municipality of Barueri between January 2013 and June 2015.He currently has the Business Management company PS7TE Participações and is a Bundesliga ambassador.
