Katrina Teivane-Korpa of Studija wrote: "Berzinsh’ creative work is characterized by a varied range of voluptuous erotica, intensified imagery, dreamlike scenes and decorativeness weighed down by visual metaphors and contrasts teetering on the edge of symbolism, postmodernism with its characteristic plundering of stylistic purity, citations and irony, and highlights the acutely romantic shadings typical of Gothic art." Berzinsh was criticized for promoting cannibalism after his live-streaming performance of Eschatology. "LMA". Lma.lv. Retrieved March 10, 2016. "vkn". Vkn.lv. Retrieved March 10, 2016.
