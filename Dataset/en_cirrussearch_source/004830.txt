The all-time medal table for all Olympic Games from 1896 to 2022, including Summer Olympic Games, Winter Olympic Games, and a combined total of both, is tabulated below. These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games. The IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes unofficial tables only per single Games. This table was thus compiled by adding up single entries from the IOC database. The results are attributed to the IOC country code as currently displayed by the IOC database. Usually, a single code corresponds to a single National Olympic Committee (NOC). When different codes are displayed for different years, medal counts are combined in the case of a simple change of IOC code (such as from HOL to NED for the Netherlands) or simple change of country name (such as from Ceylon to Sri Lanka). As the medals are attributed to each NOC, not all totals include medals won by athletes from that country for another NOC, such as before independence of that country. Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist. The totals of NOCs are not combined with those of their predecessors and successors. The table is pre-sorted by the name of each Olympic Committee, but can be displayed as sorted by any other column, such as the total number of gold medals or total number of overall medals. To sort by gold, silver, and then bronze, sort first by the bronze column, then the silver, and then the gold. The table does not count revoked medals (e.g., due to doping). A total of 156 current and historical NOCs have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 5 May 2023 are taken into account.   Special delegation, not an actual nation The sum total of gold, silver, and bronze medals are not equal for the following reasons: Some sports (such as boxing, judo, taekwondo, and wrestling) award or have previously awarded two bronze medals per competition. Team sports medals, such as in football or basketball count as one, even if there are multiple players on each team, who get a medal. Some tied performances have resulted in multiple medals of the same colour being awarded for an event. If this tie is for gold or silver, there will be a consequent absence of a silver or bronze medal for that event. Some medals that have been revoked have not been re-awarded. Some early events, such as cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics, had only two entrants. Retroactively awarding gold, silver, and bronze medals for the 1896 and 1900 games results in some anomalies, such as the 100 metre freestyle swimming event in 1896 where no surviving records distinguish the places of those who finished between 3rd and 10th position. After the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, 68 of the current 206 National Olympic Committees have yet to win an Olympic medal. Seven historic National Olympic Committees and the Refugee Olympic Team are also included in this list. Tejbir Bura was the first and only Nepalese person to receive an Olympic gold medal. During the 1924 Winter Olympic closing ceremony, the IOC awarded a gold medal in alpinism for the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition, which recognized 21 mountaineers, including the first athletes to be awarded medals posthumously, seven Indian sherpas who were killed in an avalanche on the third and last attempt to summit. A total of 10 defunct historical NOCs have earned at least one medal. A total of 8 special delegations have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 20 February are taken into account.   Special delegation, not an actual nation The following is the overall medal tally (top ten nations) with the records of current NOCs combined with those of their precursors (sorted by gold, then silver, then bronze), through 2022. Number of occurrences Number of occurrences If results for East and West Germany are combined, German athletes also won the most gold medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics and the 1988 Winter Olympics. For the 1900 Summer Olympics several countries are credited with appearances that are not considered official by the IOC. Only one of these cases concerns a medal. A gold medal that is officially added to France's total is given to Luxembourg. Other differences from the official table are based on disagreements about which events were Olympic. This affects several of the events in the 1900 and 1904 Olympics. In addition, some sources include the 1906 Intercalated Games when compiling their medal tables. From 1924 through 1936, the IOC on several occasions awarded gold medals for feats of alpinism and aeronautics that occurred in the preceding four-year Olympiad. In 1924, 1932 and 1936, gold medals were awarded to 25 mountaineers from six nations for expeditions in the Himalayas and the Matterhorn. In 1936, a gold medal was awarded to Hermann Schreiber of Switzerland for crossing the Alps in a glider in 1935, the first time that had been done. Some sources include these IOC awards of gold medals in the overall count. Australasia was a combined team of athletes from Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand that competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics. When the Olympic Games resumed in 1920 after World War I, the two nations sent separate teams to the Games, and have done so ever since. Medal counts: status after the 2022 Winter Olympics The West Indies Federation, also known as the West Indies, the Federation of the West Indies or the West Indian Federation, was a short-lived political union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962. Various islands in the Caribbean that were part of the British Empire, including Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, and those on the Leeward and Windward Islands, came together to form the Federation.The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state Before that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how it would be governed or function viably. Athletes from the West Indies Federation competed under the name Antilles (ANT), renamed to British West Indies (BWI) by the IOC, at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. Thirteen competitors—two from Barbados, four from Trinidad, and seven from Jamaica—all men, took part in thirteen events in five sports. The short-lived nation only participated at these single Games, as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago competed independently again in 1964, and Barbados started competing at the 1968 Games. Medal counts: status after the 2022 Winter Olympics Czechoslovakia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920, after having competed as Bohemia from 1900 to 1912. The nation sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the 1984 Games when they were part of the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics. Czechoslovakia has participated in every Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural Games of 1924. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia sent independent teams to the Olympics starting in 1994. Medal counts: status after the 2022 Olympics Germany has competed under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games. Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams. The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the updated medal totals from the main table. A part of Germany, Saar, competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals. Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it's possible Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations. Germany was banned on three occasions (1920, 1924, and 1948). Medal counts: status after the 2022 Olympics At the 2016 Summer Olympics nine athletes from Kuwait competed as Independent Olympic Athletes (IOA), as the Kuwait Olympic Committee had been suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the second time in five years due to governmental interference. Although not allowed to compete as a sovereign state at the 2016 Summer Olympics, the nation's participants were able to compete as Independent Olympic Athletes under the Olympic flag. At those games, Kuwaiti shooters Fehaid Al-Deehani and Abdullah Al-Rashidi won a gold medal and bronze medal respectively as independent athletes. Medal counts: status after the 2022 Olympics The Netherlands Antilles participated at the Olympic Games from 1952 until 2008 as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The National Olympic Committee for the Netherlands Antilles was created in 1931 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee from 1950 until 2011 upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. Aruba left the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 to become a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Between 1952 until 1984, Aruban athletes competed as part of the Netherlands Antilles. Since the Olympic Games in 1988, athletes from Aruba have competed separately under their own Olympic banner and have participated in each Summer Olympic Games since then. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba became part of the Netherlands as special municipalities of the Netherlands. Curaçao and Sint Maarten became separate constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. At the 2012 Olympics, participants from the five islands competed as independent athletes under the Olympic flag. However, athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles who qualified for the 2012 Olympics were allowed to participate independently under the Olympic flag, in addition to the possibility of competing for the Netherlands (as for example Churandy Martina did) or Aruba (because they have Dutch nationality). Ultimately, three athletes from the Netherlands Antilles participated as Independent Olympic Athletes. Medal counts: status after the 2022 Olympics The Republic of China (ROC) participated in its first Summer Olympics in 1932 under the name of China. After the Chinese Civil War, the ROC retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949, and only Taiwan-based athletes have competed on its behalf since then. In 1971, the ROC was expelled from the United Nations, but was permitted to compete under its official name, flag, and anthem in the 1972 Winter, 1972 Summer, and 1976 Winter Olympics. It was denied official representation in the 1976 Summer Olympics and boycotted it as a result. The 1979 Nagoya Resolution allowed the ROC to compete under the deliberately-ambiguous name "Chinese Taipei"; it protested against this decision and boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics as well, but has competed under this name since the 1984 Winter Olympics. The Republic of China took part in the Opening Ceremony of the 1924 Summer Olympics, but its four athletes, all of whom were tennis players, withdrew from competition. Medal counts: status after the 2022 Olympics The Russian Federation, the Russian Empire, the Olympic Athletes from Russia and the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) are sometimes combined outside of IOC sources. The Soviet Union is often combined with the post-union team that competed in 1992. Some sources combine the Soviet Union and Russia, despite the fact that many republics which subsequently gained or re-gained independence (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) contributed to the medal tally of the USSR, and there are sources that combine all medals of RU1, URS, EUN, OAR, ROC and RUS. On 31 January 1992, the United Nations recognized, without objection, Russia as legal successor of the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union, but this has no significance in medal tallies. Medal counts: Russia combined with precursors status after the 2022 Olympics Medal counts: Post-Soviet states (except Russia) status after the 2022 Olympics Teams from Yugoslavia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920. Yugoslavia has been the designation for Olympic teams from three distinct national entities: Kingdom of Yugoslavia (officially called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929) from 1920 to 1936 Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1948 to the 1992 Winter Olympics Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, formed as a joint state by only Montenegro and Serbia after the breakup of Yugoslavia, from 1996 to 2002 The United Nations affirmed that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had ceased to exist, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was a new state. All former republics were entitled to state succession, while none of them continued SFR Yugoslavia's international legal personality. As a result of the U.N. resolution, individual FRY athletes were allowed to compete as Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and FRY was not allowed to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, consisting of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro, participated at the Games since 1996. At the 1996 and 2000 Games, the nation was designated with the same code, Yugoslavia (YUG), as the defunct SFRY. It was rechartered as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 with there being no territorial changes. The Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) designation and code were used at the 2004 Games. Two of the successor nations (Croatia and Slovenia) began to compete as independent teams at the Olympics starting at the 1992 Winter Games and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 1992 Summer Games and as of the 2008 Summer Olympics, all six successor nations, former socialist republics, have participated independently. Kosovo, a former autonomous province, made its Olympic debut as an independent national team at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Medal counts: status after the 2022 Olympics In addition to the teams of Independent Olympians at the Olympic Games mentioned above—Kuwait, Russia, the former Netherlands Antilles, and the former Yugoslavia—several other NOCs were represented by independent Olympic athletes. East Timor's team in 2000 consisted of four athletes competing as Individual Olympic Athletes. In 2012, one independent Olympic athlete represented South Sudan. In the 2014 Winter Olympics, the team from India included one independent Olympic participant.
