Dmitri Dmitrievich Kugryshev (Russian: Дмитрий Дмитриевич Кугрышев; born 18 January 1990) is a Russian professional ice hockey forward. He is currently playing with HC Lada Togliatti in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Kugryshev was selected by the Washington Capitals in the 2nd round (58th overall) of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. He originally pursued his NHL ambition in transitioning to a major junior career in North America with the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League before signing a three-year entry-level contract with the Capitals on March 9, 2010. At the completion of the 2016–17 season, Kugryshev alongside Semyon Koshelyov was traded by CSKA to Avangard Omsk in exchange for Anton Burdasov on May 2, 2017. After spending the 2017–18 season, with Avangard posting 11 goals and 25 points in 50 games, Kugryshev left as a free agent to sign a one-year deal with Salavat Yulaev Ufa on May 1, 2018. On 8 July 2021, Kugryshev joined his fifth KHL outfit, in agreeing to a two-year contract as a free agent with HC Spartak Moscow. During his final season under contract with Spartak Moscow in 2022–23, in collecting just 2 goals and 3 points in 17 games, Kugryshev was transferred from Spartak to divisional rivals, HC Vityaz, on 21 November 2022. After playing out the remainder of his contract with Vityaz, Kugrshev left the club in the off-season. As a free agent, Kugryshev opted to join Lada Togliatti for their return to the KHL, by signing a one-year contract for the 2023–24 season on 19 June 2023.
