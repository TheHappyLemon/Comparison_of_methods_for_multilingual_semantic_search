Strömberg was acquired by Swedish ASEA in 1987, then later in 1988 when ASEA merged with Brown, Boveri & Cie to form ABB, the company became a division of ABB and hence known as ABB Strömberg. In the later 1990s, the company name was changed from ABB Strömberg Oy into ABB Oy and a more integral part of ABB. The company Strömberg expanded in an early stage and founded another factory branch in Vaasa, Finland, in an area which is now known as Strömberg Park. The Strömberg Park area was planned, and parts of the buildings there today were designed by Alvar Aalto. The company has many inventions and firsts to its credit.
