Finally, six places were awarded through three Olympic qualification tournaments.

Leading at 16-14 after the first half, Denmark retained their lead to win the match 28-26. This was Denmark's first medal in the handball event at the Olympics, having reached their best, a fourth place in 1984. Danish player Jannick Green "dreamt about one day making" the final, and the team "worked really hard and played well". The result put an end to the French period of dominance at the Olympics, having won the two prior events in 2008 and 2012. French player Luka Karabatic commented "When you’ve got a medal around your neck it’s a little bit different and you can see what you achieved as a team... Getting a silver medal is something unbelievable." The competition consisted of two stages; a group stage followed by a knockout stage.
