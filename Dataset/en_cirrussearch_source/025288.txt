The treaty restores the borders to those established by several treaties (thus recognizing Bulgaria's possession of Macedonia). July 12 – King Æthelstan of Wessex claims his kingdom and receives the submission of High-Reeve Ealdred I of Bamburgh and probably also of Owain ap Dyfnwal, King of Strathclyde, at Eamont Bridge.
