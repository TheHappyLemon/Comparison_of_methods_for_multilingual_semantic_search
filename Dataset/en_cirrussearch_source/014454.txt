The Providence Bruins are a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League (AHL), and are the primary development team for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). They play at the Amica Mutual Pavilion in Providence, Rhode Island. The Providence Bruins began operation for the start of the 1992–93 AHL season after Providence mayor Buddy Cianci negotiated a deal with the owners of the Maine Mariners franchise, Frank DuRoss and Ed Anderson, to relocate their club. The move saw AHL hockey return to Providence for the first time since the Providence Reds, a founding member of the AHL, left town in 1977. The Bruins captured their first AHL Calder Cup in the 1999 playoffs, after a regular season in which they dominated the league with 56 regular season wins. Led by rookie head coach Peter Laviolette and paced by Les Cunningham Award winner Randy Robitaille, the Bruins went from only 19 victories the previous season, to dropping the Rochester Americans four games to one to skate away with the league championship. In the 2001–02 season, the Providence Bruins contracted with then-13-year-old musician Ben Schwartz to work as the official organist at all home games. As a result, Schwartz, who provided music for seven years until the conclusion of the 2007–08 season, is the youngest organist to ever work for a professional North American sports franchise. In August 2006, DuRoss sold his majority interest in the club to Massachusetts businessman H. Larue Renfroe. After the 2019–20 season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bruins moved to a temporary home in the New England Sports Center in Marlborough, Massachusetts, as the Dunkin' Donuts Center was being used by the state of Rhode Island for pandemic-related operations. The New England Sport Center is also owned by team owner H. Larue Renfroe. The Bruins returned to the Dunkin' Donuts Center for the 2021–22 AHL season. In September 2022, the home arena was renamed to Amica Mutual Pavilion. This market was previously served by: Providence Reds (1926–1977) "Samboni" the anthropomorphic bear serves as the Bruins' team mascot similar to the Boston Bruins' "Blades the Bruin".
