Meulan-en-Yvelines (French pronunciation: [mølɑ̃ ɑ̃.n‿ivlin]; formerly just Meulan) is a commune in the Yvelines department in the Île-de-France region in north-central France. It hosted part of the sailing events for the 1900 Summer Olympics held in neighbouring Paris, and would do so again 24 years later. In 1435, as a part of the Hundred Years' War, Ambroise de Loré and Jean de Dunois defeated the English nearby. Meulan hosted the first regatta in the sailing event at the 1900 Summer Olympics. The coat of arms of Meulan-en-Yvelines is blazoned as: Azure semy-de-lys or, a chief chequy or and gules of four tiers. The shield of arms is composed of the ancient arms of France, granted to the village as an augmentation of honour by Henri IV in 1590, with a chief displaying the first four tiers of the chequy or and gules arms of the ancient Counts of Meulan.
