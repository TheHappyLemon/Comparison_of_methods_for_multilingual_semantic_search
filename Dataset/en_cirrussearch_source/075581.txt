In his subsequent career he won one bronze and five silver medals in the Bobsleigh European Championship, one World Cup race (a two-man event at Cesana Pariol in 2007) and four Swiss national titles (two in each of the two-man and four man disciplines). Rüegg competed in two Winter Olympics, earning his best finish of fourth in the two-man event at Vancouver in 2010. He won the Bobsleigh World Cup championship in the two-man event in 2009-10.
