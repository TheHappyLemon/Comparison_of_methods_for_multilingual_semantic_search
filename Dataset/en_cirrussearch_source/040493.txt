FK Teplice is a Czech professional football club based in the city of Teplice. The club competes in Czech First League, the top tier of Czech football. The club was founded after World War II in 1945. The club advanced to the Czechoslovak First League in just three years after being founded and played mostly in the First and Second Czechoslovak divisions. After the Velvet Revolution and comeback of rich sponsor, Glaverbel (spun out of glassworks Sklo Union in 1991), the club played in the Second Division until returning to the top flight in the 1996–97 Czech First League. Teplice were runners up in the 1998–99 Czech First League and went on to play in the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League, although they lost their first match against Borussia Dortmund. The club subsequently won the Czech Cup in 2003 and went on to beat Kaiserslautern and Feyenoord en route to the third round of the 2003–04 UEFA Cup before losing over two legs against Celtic. The club's best league position was second in the 1998–99 season. In the 2004–05 season the team finished third, with the same number of points as second-place Slavia Prague. The finish allowed them to play in the third round of the UEFA Cup qualification, which Teplice won against MTZ-RIPO Minsk. In the first round of the UEFA Cup Teplice faced Espanyol. They were eliminated after drawing 1–1 in the first leg and losing 0–2 in the second leg. In the 2007–08 season the team finished in fifth place in the Czech First League. The result earned them a place in the 2008 Intertoto Cup. However they lost on away goals in their first fixture, against Budapest Honvéd FC. In 2009 Teplice again won the cup, qualifying yet again for European competition, this time the newly branded 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. However they went out in their first fixture, a 2–3 aggregate loss against Hapoel Tel Aviv. 1945 — SK Teplice-Šanov (Sportovní klub Teplice-Šanov) 1948 — Sokol Teplice 1949 — ZSJ Technomat Teplice (Základní sportovní jednota Technomat Teplice) 1951 — ZSJ Vodotechna Teplice (Základní sportovní jednota Vodotechna Teplice) 1952 — ZSJ Ingstav Teplice (Základní sportovní jednota Ingstav Teplice) 1953 — DSO Tatran Teplice (Dobrovolná sportovní organizace Tatran Teplice) 1960 — TJ Slovan Teplice (Tělovýchovná jednota Slovan Teplice) 1966 — TJ Sklo Union Teplice (Tělovýchovná jednota Sklo Union Teplice) 1991 — TFK VTJ Teplice (Tělovýchovný fotbalový klub Vojenská tělovýchovná jednota Teplice) 1993 — FK Frydrych Teplice (Fotbalový klub Frydrych Teplice) 1994 — FK Teplice (Fotbalový klub Teplice, a.s.)
