JTBC (shortened from Joongang Tongyang Broadcasting Company; Korean: 제이티비씨; stylized as jtbc) is a South Korean nationwide pay television network. Its primary shareholder is JoongAng Holdings, with a 25% stake. It was launched on 1 December 2011. JTBC is a generalist channel, with programming consisting of television series, variety shows, and news broadcasting; its news division is held in similar regard to the three main terrestrial networks in South Korea.[citation needed] JTBC was one of four new South Korean nationwide generalist cable TV networks alongside Dong-A Ilbo's Channel A, Chosun Ilbo's TV Chosun and Maeil Kyungje's MBN launch in 2011, to serve as supplementary networks to the existing conventional free-to-air TV networks like KBS, MBC, SBS and other smaller channels launched following deregulation in 1990. The JoongAng Ilbo, which used to be a part of the Samsung, had owned a TV station before. In 1964 it founded the Tongyang Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) and ran the network for 16 years. In 1980, however TBC was forcibly merged with the state-run KBS by the military regime of Chun Doo-hwan. At its founding in 2011 some media analysts considered the return of JoongAng Ilbo to television in JTBC as the reincarnation of TBC.
