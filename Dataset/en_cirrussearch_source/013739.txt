Adai (also Adaizan, Adaizi, Adaise, Adahi, Adaes, Adees, Atayos) is an extinct Native American language that was spoken in northwestern Louisiana. It was once proposed that there may be a connection between Adai and the nearby Caddoan languages, but this now seems unlikely. Adai is known only from a list of 275 words from 1804 by John Sibley. The manuscript word list below has been reproduced from Grant's (1995) transcriptions.
