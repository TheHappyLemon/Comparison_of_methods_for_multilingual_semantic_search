The Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex (also known as Olympic Stadium; Ukrainian: Національний спортивний комплекс "Олімпійський", romanized: Natsionalnyi sportyvnyi kompleks "Olimpiiskyi") is a multi-use sports and recreation facility in Kyiv, Ukraine, located on the slopes of the city's central Cherepanova Hora (Cherepanov Hill), Pecherskyi District. The Olympic National Sports Complex Stadium is the premier sports venue in Ukraine and the sixteenth largest such venue in Europe. Although it is often used by FC Dynamo Kyiv for football matches, it is technically not the football club's home stadium. Since May 2020, the stadium has also been used for the home matches of Shakhtar Donetsk due to the war in Donbas. The complex beside its stadium also features several other sports facilities and is designed to host the Olympic Games (the stadium hosted some football matches at the 1980 Summer Olympics). Following extensive renovation, including the construction of a new roof, the stadium was reopened on 9 October 2011 with a performance by Shakira, and had its international inauguration with a 3–3 friendly draw by Ukraine against Germany on 11 November 2011. It hosted the final of the UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final. After Ukrainian independence in 1991, the stadium was given national status in 1996 and renamed again as the "Olympic" National Sports Complex. Kyivans still commonly refer to it as the Tsentralny (Central) or Respublykanskyi stadion (Republican Stadium); the nearby metro station "Olimpiiska" is also called "Respublykanskyi Stadion". In 1997–99, the stadium was renovated again in accordance with FIFA guidelines, and its capacity was reduced to 83,450. The stadium continued to serve as the home territory of Dynamo, with the Lobanovsky stadium serving as a training ground. Sometime after 1998, major changes took place, as it was no longer efficient to keep and maintain the stadium as a club ground. Dynamo decided to reconstruct the Lobanovsky Dynamo Stadium as its primary ground, because match attendances rarely exceeded 10,000 spectators. Since that time, Olympic has been used primarily for football international matches, and it was lent to FC Dynamo Kyiv for high-profile home games when a high attendance was expected. However, it is not the official home ground of Dynamo or any other Kyiv club, as they all have smaller home stadiums and training bases. The stadium is an official home ground of the Ukraine national football team and was the official venue of the Ukrainian Cup final until 2008. In 2008, the stadium underwent a major reconstruction in preparation for the continental championship. For most of its history, the stadium was known as the Republican Stadium. 1923–1924: Leon Trotsky Red Stadium 1924–1935: Red Stadium 1936–1938: Stanislav Kosior Republican Stadium 1938–1941: Republican Stadium 1941: Nikita Khrushchev Republican Stadium (50,000 capacity in 1941) 1941–1943: All-Ukrainian Stadium (Occupation by Nazi Germany) 1943–1962: Nikita Khrushchev Republican Stadium (capacity reduced to 47,756 in 1944) 1962–1979: Central Stadium (100,062 capacity in 1967) 1980–1996: Republican Stadium 1996–present: Olympic National Sports Complex (83,450 capacity in 1999; reduced to 70,050 in 2011) During the 1980 Summer Olympics, three Group C and three Group D matches, as well as a quarter-final, were scheduled at the stadium, for a total of seven games. In the first of these matches (held on 20 July 1980), East Germany tied with Spain by a scoreline of 1–1. The sole quarter-final (held on 27 July 1980) saw East Germany beat Iraq with a record-breaking score of 4–0 on the way to their third title. On 18 April 2007, Poland and Ukraine were chosen by UEFA to co-host the finals of Euro 2012, with the Olimpiyskiy Stadium set to host the final. The reconstruction of the stadium involved the demolition and rebuilding of the lower tier, a completely new west stand with a two-level press box, luxury boxes between the two tiers, the addition of a 13-storey high-rise building to the west (to house the Sheraton Kyiv Olimpiysky Hotel), and the addition of a new roof (of unique design) covering the entire seating area. The capacity of the stadium after the reconstruction is 70,050. Reconstruction began on 1 December 2008, when the winner of a tender was announced. It was scheduled to be finished in 2011. The stadium was officially opened by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych on 8 October 2011. The three Group D matches involving Sweden, a quarter-final, and the final were scheduled for here (with the other matches in Group D being played at the Donbass Arena). In the first match, Ukraine beat Sweden by a scoreline of 2–1. The final, held on 1 July 2012, saw Spain defeat Italy by the record-breaking score of 4–0 on the way to their third title. When international music superstars or bands come to Kyiv, their concerts are often held in this stadium, as it is the biggest in Ukraine and one of the biggest in Europe. Artists who have performed here include George Michael and Shakira. The Rolling Stones were scheduled to perform at the stadium on 25 July 2007 as part of their A Bigger Bang Tour, but the concert was moved to Warsaw, Poland because of political crisis and early parliament elections in Ukraine. On 25 July 2012 a concert of the bands Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kasabian and The Vaccines was held in the stadium. Madonna performed a concert at the stadium on 4 August 2012 as part of her The MDNA Tour. 31,022 people visited her show. Depeche Mode performed at the stadium on 29 June 2013 during their The Delta Machine Tour, in front of a crowd of 36,562 people. Famous Ukrainian rock-band Okean Elzy performed in the stadium their 20 anniversary on 21 June 2014, with an attendance of 71,045 people. The band again performed here on 18 June 2016 as part of their 2016–2017 world tour. Aerosmith were scheduled to perform at the stadium on 2 July 2014 as part of their Global Warming Tour. However, the concert was cancelled due to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. The stadium is located right in the centre of Kyiv on the right bank of the River Dnipro. The stadium can be approached mainly by either Velyka Vasylkivska Street or Lesi Ukrainki Boulevard. Both streets' southern ends connect to the European route E95, which is known at that part of the city as Druzhby Narodiv Boulevard. However the main arena of the complex does not have a direct access to the mentioned streets and can only be reached through several smaller streets such as Fizkultury, Saksahanskoho, Shota Rustaveli, Esplanadna Streets and Hospitalny Lane. There are several subway stations on the Kyiv Metro located within walking distance: "Olimpiiska" (~300 metres (0.19 mi)) and "Palats Sportu" (~400 metres (0.25 mi)). These are usually closed during matches. It is possible to use other nearby stations Klovska, Zoloti Vorota, Teatralna, Palats "Ukrayina". In December 2010, Kyiv City State Administration renamed the subway station "Respublikansky Stadion" as "Olimpiiska".
