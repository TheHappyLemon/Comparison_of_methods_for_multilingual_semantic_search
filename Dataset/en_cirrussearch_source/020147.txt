Česká Třebová (Czech pronunciation: [ˈtʃɛskaː ˈtr̝̊ɛbovaː]; German: Böhmisch Trübau) is a town in Ústí nad Orlicí District in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 15,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone. Villages of Kozlov, Lhotka, Parník, Skuhrov and Svinná are administrative parts of Česká Třebová. The name Třebová is derived from the old Czech verb triebiti, which meant "chop down, clear". The name refers to the founding of settlements on the site of forest that had to be cut down first. First the name of the Třebovka river was created, then it was transferred to the settlements along the river. The attribute Česká (meaning "Bohemian") was added to distinguish it from Moravská Třebová. Česká Třebová is located about 8 kilometres (5 mi) south of Ústí nad Orlicí and 49 km (30 mi) southeast of Pardubice. It lies in the Svitavy Uplands. The highest point is the hill Palice at 613 m (2,011 ft) above sea level. The town is situated in the valley of the Třebovka River. The first written mention of Česká Třebová is from 1278. It was founded during the reign of King Ottokar II of Bohemia as a town with regular ground plan and rectangular square in its centre. In 1304, King Wenceslaus II gave it to the Zbraslav Monastery and later, in the 14th century, the town belonged to the bishops of Litomyšl. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the town prospered. It was owned by various noble families, including the Pernštejn family and the Bohdanecký of Hodkov family, which supported textile crafts and had the Renaissance bell tower built. Due to the Thirty Years' War, plagues and fires, it became poor and insignificant. This state lasted until the middle of the 19th century. In 1845, the railway from Prague to Olomouc via Česká Třebová was built and in 1849, the railway from Brno to Česká Třebová was built. This greatly aided the town development, helped to create new jobs and attract new people. Česká Třebová railway station is a major railway junction linking Prague with two pan-European corridors. The town is home to a 4th league ice hockey club, HC Kohouti Česká Třebová, which plays at the "Na Skále" arena with a capacity of 1,200 spectators. The historic centre is located around the Staré Square. The landmark of the square is the town hall, probably built in 1547. In the middle of the square is the Marian column from 1706. The Church of Saint James the Great was built in the Neoclassical style in 1794–1801. There are several valuable late Baroque statues from 1712 to 1719 around the church. The deanery next to the church was built in 1783–1786. The church is connected to the square by two parallel streets, Klácelova and Hýblova. In Klácelova street is the Neoclassical house No. 11 from 1804 that houses the town museum and the tourist information centre. The Chapel of Saint Catherine was built in the early 13th century and is older than the town. The originally Romanesque rotunda was mixed with other styles during several reconstructions. Kozlov is known for the cottage which Max Švabinský often visited and painted here. Today there is an exposition of the town museum. In Kozlov there is also the wooden Chapel of the Virgin mary from 1753. Above Kozlov on the Kozlovský hill with an altitude of 601 metres (1,972 ft) is a 55 metres (180 ft)-high observation tower.
