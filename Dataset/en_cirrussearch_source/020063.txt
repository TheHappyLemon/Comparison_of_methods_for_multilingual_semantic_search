The first written mention of Bystré is from 1200 in the chronicle written by Wenceslaus Hajek, where it is written about Bystré in the year 1021 or 1098.

Until 1213, Bystré was owned by the Mokrošínský family, who extended the settlement and had built a square shaped as a horseshoe. From 1213, the village belonged to the Svojanov estate, later owned by Záviš of Falkenstein. After his death, Bystré became a property of the royal chamber. Bystré received the town rights during the reign of King Charles IV. In the 15th century, it became property of the Svojanovský of Boskovice family. In 1507, the town gained a number of privileges, such as toll collection right and the right for a weekly market. Sometime during the 16th century, a small hunting fortress was built. Jan Bezdružický of Kolowrat became the town owner in the 1580s. In 1586–1590, he had built a new Renaissance castle. Jan died in 1604 and was buried in a tomb in the local church. The following owners, lords of Martinice, started mining of iron ore in Hamry (currently a part of the municipality of Bystré). During the Thirty Years' War the town was devastated. Jan Pavel of Walderode bought the Bystré estate in 1686. In 1707 the estate was sold again, this time in an auction to the count of Liechtenstein who exchanged it with Jakub Hanibal, the Count of Hohenems, in 1710. Jakub Hanibal had built the town hall. During the rule of his son, Franz Rudolph, the construction of a new church started and spa Balda was founded in the neighbourhood.
