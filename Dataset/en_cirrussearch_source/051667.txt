He made his professional debut as a 66th-minute substitute for Servette in a Swiss Super League match against Lausanne-Sport on 26 September 2012, which turned out to be his only appearance for the club. After a successful trial at the age of 17, Mbabu signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Newcastle United, moving for an undisclosed fee on 31 January 2013. Upon joining the club, he was immediately assigned to the development squad.

Mbabu was placed in quarantine at home, and would likely miss a scheduled game on 5 August in Kyiv that had been postponed due to the pandemic. As a precaution, testing was carried out on the athletes before they resumed training, and all other tests carried out on 22 July and 25 July had returned negative. On 27 July 2022, Mbabu joined newly promoted Premier League club Fulham for a reported fee of €5.5 million with and additional €2 million in add-ons, on a three-year deal, with the option to extend for a further twelve months.

On 13 February, Mbabu returned to his youth club Servette FC on loan for the remainder of the 2022–23 season. On 1 September 2023, Mbabu joined Bundesliga club Augsburg on a season-long loan. Due to his mixed descent, Mbabu was eligible to play for Switzerland, DR Congo and France. He was a youth international for Switzerland, from the under–16 to under–21 side. In May 2018, Mbabu was named in the Switzerland's preliminary squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. However, he was cut from the squad after Switzerland's preliminary squad was cut to 26. He made his debut on 8 September 2018, in the starting lineup against the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League match against Iceland.
