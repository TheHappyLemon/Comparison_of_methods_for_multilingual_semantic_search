Peniki (Russian: Пе́ники, tr. Péniki, IPA: [ˈpʲenʲɪkʲɪ] , Finnish: Penikkala) is a rural locality (a village) in Lomonosovsky District of Leningrad Oblast, Russia. Municipally, it is a part and the administrative center of Penikovskoye Rural Settlement. The village was founded between 1763 and 1782. During the Emancipation Reform of 1861 in the Russian Empire, the local Orthodox priest Vasily wrote a description of the poverty and profiteering of the country's folks, which has been preserved. The priest often reports about the peasants, so the landlords knew all about their faults. At this time, a manor was built here, at which the owner bred hounds and sold puppies. It is from this enterprise that the town's name derives - Peniki (Penniki, Penikkala), which is from the Finnish word penikka, which means "a puppy." The climate in the village of Peniki is close to a cool temperate climate with moderately warm summers and moderately cold winters. Under the Köppen climate classification, Peniki is classified as Dfb, a humid continental climate. The winters are warmer here than in Moscow due to its closeness to the Gulf of Finland. The Gulf of Finland is located just 1 km from the center of the village. The average maximum temperature in July is 22 °C (71.6 °F), and the average minimum temperature in February is −10.5 °C (13.1 °F). Average annual precipitation is 669 millimeters (26.338 in) per year.
