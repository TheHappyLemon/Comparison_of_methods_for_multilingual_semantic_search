The 0 to 0.5 ton was a sailing event on the Sailing at the 1900 Summer Olympics program in Meulan. Seven boats started during the two races in the 0 – 0.5 ton. Twelve competitors from France are documented. The races were held on 22 and 24 May 1900 on the river Seine. For the 0 to 0.5 ton the 8 kilometres (4.3 nmi) course in the Meulan course area was used. Course area Meulan The race was troublesome due to an almost complete absence of any wind. Also the fact that the wind there was came perpendicular to the course (river Seine) and was blocked or diverted by trees and buildings. Two separate races were sailed. No combined results were made. Initially only the race on 22 May 1900 was part of the Olympic program. However the race on the 24 May 1900, initially part of the Exposition Universelle program, was afterwards awarded with an Olympic status.
