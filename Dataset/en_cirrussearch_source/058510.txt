Solko Johannes van den Bergh (4 June 1854 in The Hague – 25 December 1916 in The Hague) was a Dutch sport shooter. Van den Bergh was a notary by profession who on 6 June 1880 married the noble Sophia Emma Nicoletta van Limburg Brouwer in Zeist. Together with his friend Henrik Sillem and the Frenchman François Monod he initiated the first "international shooting matches" (world championships in shooting) in 1897 in Lyon. These were the forerunners of the matches that were held in Paris in 1900, now considered to have been part of the Olympics. Van den Bergh participated in these and won a bronze medal with the Dutch pistol team. "Solko van den Bergh". Olympedia. Retrieved 30 December 2020.
