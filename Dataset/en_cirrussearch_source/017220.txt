2013 GP2 Series Drivers' Champion: Fabio Leimer Teams' Champion: Russian Time Previous 2012 Next 2014 Parent series: Formula One Support series: GP3 Series The 2013 GP2 Series season was the forty-seventh season of the second-tier of Formula One feeder championship and also ninth season under the GP2 Series moniker, a support series to the 2013 Formula One World Championship. The 2013 season saw three new teams — Russian Time, Hilmer Motorsport and MP Motorsport — join the championship, replacing iSport International, Ocean Racing Technology and Scuderia Coloni. 2013 was scheduled to be the last season in which teams compete with the third-generation GP2 car — the Dallara GP2/11 — which was introduced in 2011, but series organisers decided to keep the GP2/11 for another three-year cycle in a bid to keep costs down. The season saw 10 different winners. Champion Fabio Leimer took 3 race wins, as runner-up Sam Bird took 5 victories, Jolyon Palmer took 2 race wins, as did Jon Lancaster. Stefano Coletti took 3 sprint race wins. Adrian Quaife-Hobbs, Nathanael Berthon, Marcus Ericsson and Alexander Rossi each took 1 race win, and ART Grand Prix driver James Calado took 2 race wins. Twenty-six drivers representing thirteen teams was scheduled to take part in the championship. The driver who is declared champion received a Formula One test with tyre supplier Pirelli as their prize, as well as qualifying for an FIA Superlicence. After racing as «Lotus GP» in 2011 and 2012, ART Grand Prix reverted to using its original name in 2013. Scuderia Coloni did not participate in the 2013 season following what the team described as a "disagreement" between themselves and series organisers during the 2012 season.

However, Razia lost his seat with the team less than a month later, and did not secure a seat in the GP2 Series. Davide Valsecchi, who won the 2012 championship with DAMS, left the series, as GP2 champions are not permitted to continue racing in the category. Valsecchi was later promoted to the role of test and reserve driver for Formula One team Lotus F1. Giedo van der Garde left the GP2 Series for Formula One, where he continued racing for Caterham.
