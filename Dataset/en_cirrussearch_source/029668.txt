Klobouky u Brna is a town in Břeclav District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 2,500 inhabitants. The village of Bohumilice is an administrative part of Klobouky u Brna. The name Klobouky literally means 'hats'. it was probably derived from the shape of the surrounding hills. Klobouky u Brna is located about 28 kilometres (17 mi) southeast from Brno. Almost the entire municipal territory lies in the Ždánice Forest, only a small part in the east extends into the Kyjov Hills. The highest point is the Nedánov hill at 368 m (1,207 ft) above sea level. The first written mention of both Klobouky and Bohumilice is from 1210, when Lev of Klobouky donated the villages to the Premonstratensian monastery in Zábrdovice (today part of Brno), which he founded. In 1298, Klobouky was promoted to a market town by King Wenceslaus II. The monastery owned the Klobouky estate until its abolishment in 1784. Klobouky was located on an important route between Moravia and Kingdom of Hungary, from which it profited in times of peace, but suffered from the passage of troops and looting in times of war. The settlement was badly damaged during the Bocskai uprising and during the Thirty Years' War. Klobouky obtained the town status in 1964. On 7 October 1992, the town was renamed Klobouky u Brna. Among the landmarks of the town centre are a castle and two churches. The Church of Saint Lawrence was built in the Baroque style in 1655. The Evangelical church was built in the Historicist style and dates from the second half of the 19th century. The Klobouky u Brna Castle is the most important urban component of the town. It originally served as a residence of the Zábrdovice monastery. Today it houses the town museum. The main symbol of Klobouky u Brna is a two-story wooden windmill, located on a hill near the town. It was moved here from Pacetluky in 1825. After it was destroyed by fire during World War II, the mill was reconstructed in 1985. The Chapel of Saint Barbara was built in 1669. It is a distinctive feature located on a hill above the town. "Population of Municipalities – 1 January 2023". Czech Statistical Office. 2023-05-23. "Klobouky u Brna" (in Czech). CzechTourism.
