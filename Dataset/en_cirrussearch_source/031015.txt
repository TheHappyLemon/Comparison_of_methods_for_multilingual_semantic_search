Nephropoidea is a superfamily of decapod crustaceans. It contains the true lobsters in the Nephropidae (including the rare thaumastochelid lobsters), and three fossil families: Chilenophoberidae, Protastacidae and Stenochiridae. Their closest relatives are the reef lobsters. Sammy De Grave; N. Dean Pentcheff; Shane T. Ahyong; et al. (2009). "A classification of living and fossil genera of decapod crustaceans" (PDF).
