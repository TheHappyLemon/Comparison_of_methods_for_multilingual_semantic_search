The Kasari is a river in western Estonia that drains into Matsalu Bay, which is part of Väinameri. A 308-metre-long pedestrian bridge was built over it in 1904, and it was the longest concrete bridge in Europe at the time. The river itself is 112 km long, and is the fourth-longest river in Estonia. The river is a home to a variety of fish, including pike and roach.
