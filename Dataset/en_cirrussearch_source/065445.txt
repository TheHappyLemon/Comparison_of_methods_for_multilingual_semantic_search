Tual (Indonesian: Kota Tual) is a city in Maluku Province of Indonesia, geographically located within the Kei Islands. On 17 July 2007, it was separated from the rest of the Kei Islands (which continue to form the Southeast Maluku Regency) and was created an independent city. The city covers a land area of 254.39 km2 (98.22 sq mi), together with a sea area estimated at 19,088 km2 (7,370 sq mi). It includes the urbanized Dullah Island (Indonesian: Pulau Dullah) which is situated to the northeast of the much larger Kei Kecil, and includes a further number of small islands to the west of Kei Kecil. The city comprises the main Dullah Island (Pulau Dullah) together with numerous smaller islands off the north of Kei Kecil island, together with the small archipelagoes of the Tayando Islands, and Kur Islands, which lie to the west of the Kei Islands. The total land area of these islands is 254.39 km2 (98.22 sq mi). The Tayando Islands have a maximum altitude of around 100 metres above the sea, while the Kur Islands has an altitude of around 400 metres. On Dullah Island, the city has a small slope between 0 to 25 degrees, most of it generally considered to be a low-lying region. However, there are several points within the city boundaries that have steep slopes above 45 degrees. The majority of the soils in the city are latosol, podzol, and rendzina. The soils generally are fertile and have good drainage, with the inhabitants using the land for agriculture, especially during the rainy season, growing various tubers. Tual has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with moderate rainfall from July to October and heavy to very heavy rainfall from November to June.{{Weather box The city as of 2010 was divided into four districts (kecamatan), but subsequently in 2018 a fifth district — Kur Selatan (South Kur) — was created from part of Pulau-Pulau Kur District.
