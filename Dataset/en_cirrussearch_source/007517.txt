Resourcesat-2 is a follow on mission to Resourcesat-1 and the eighteenth Indian remote sensing satellite built by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The new satellite provides the same services as the original Resourcesat-1, but was also designed to "provide data with enhanced multispectral and spatial coverage". Compared to Resourcesat-1, LISS-4 multispectral swath has been enhanced from 23 km to 70 km based on user needs. Suitable changes including miniaturization in payload electronics have been incorporated in Resourcesat-2. Resourcesat-2 along with YouthSat and X-Sat (Singapore) was launched by the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle PSLV-C16 on 20 April 2011, at 04:42 UTC. The satellite carries three electrooptical cameras on board: Advanced Wide-Field Sensor (AWiFS) with 56 meter spatial resolution The Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor-3 (LISS-3) with 23.5 meter spatial resolution The Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor-4 (LISS-4) with 5.8 meter spatial resolution Additionally, the satellite carries an AIS-receiver for exactEarth (COMDEV), which is known as exactView 2 (EV 2). The three cameras of ResourceSat-2, were switched on, on 28 April 2011, and the images of high quality were received at Shadnagar Earth Station of the National Remote Sensing Centre of ISRO.
