In the 1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election Starukh failed to get elected to the Ukrainian parliament for People's Movement of Ukraine.

On 25 September 2008, President Viktor Yushchenko appointed Starukh Governor of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. He was dismissed from this post by Yanukovych on 18 March 2010. Starukh failed again to go into national politics when in the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election; as a candidate of Batkivshchyna he lost in electoral district 75, located in Zaporizhzhia, to Serhiy Kaltsev [uk] of Party of Regions.

In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election Starukh was placed 49th on the (national) election list of Batkivshchyna, but he was not elected because the party won 17 seats on the (national) party list, and two seats in majority constituencies. In the 2015 Ukrainian local elections Starukh was elected a member of the Zaporizhzhia Oblast Council for Batkivshchyna.
