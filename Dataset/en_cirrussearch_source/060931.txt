Iziaslav (also Izyaslav) (Ukrainian: Ізя́слав Izjáslav, pronounced [iˈzʲɑslɐu̯] ) or Zaslav (Ukrainian: Заслав, IPA: [ˈzɑslɐu̯]; Polish: Zasław, IPA: [ˈzaswaf]) is one of the oldest cities in Volhynia. Situated on the Horyn river (Ukrainian: Горинь Horýnʹ) in western Ukraine, the city dates back to the 11th century. Iziaslav belongs to Shepetivka Raion of Khmelnytskyi Oblast. It hosts the administration of Iziaslav settlement hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 15,296 (2022 estimate). Izyaslav was first mentioned in 1390. It was a private town in Poland, owned by the Zasławski and Sanguszko families. It was part of the Polish Volhynian Voivodeship. In 1583 it was granted Magdeburg city rights. After the Partitions of Poland Izyaslav was part of the Russian Empire – Volhynian Governorate. At the beginning of World War II, the town had a Jewish population representing 28% of the inhabitants. As soon as the Germans occupied the town, Jews were kept imprisoned in a ghetto and were later murdered in mass executions perpetrated by Einsatzgruppen. Until 18 July 2020, Iziaslav was the administrative center of Iziaslav Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Khmelnytskyi Oblast to three. The area of Iziaslav Raion was merged into Shepetivka Raion.
