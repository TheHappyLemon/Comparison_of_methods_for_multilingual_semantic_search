Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Mongolia ratified the convention on 2 February 1990. Mongolia has six sites on the list. The first site, the Uvs Nuur Basin, was listed in 2003. The most recent site, the Deer Stone Monuments and Related Bronze Age Sites, was listed in 2023. Two sites are natural and transnational sites shared with Russia. The other four sites are cultural. In addition, Mongolia has 11 sites on the tentative list. UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.   * Transnational site In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Mongolia has 12 properties on its tentative list. "The World Heritage Convention".
