Since the Premier League's formation at the start of the 1992–93 season, 13 players have accrued 500 or more appearances in the Premier League. The first player to reach the milestone was midfielder Gary Speed, in representation of Leeds United, Everton, Newcastle United and Bolton Wanderers; his 500th match was Bolton's 4–0 win over West Ham United on 9 December 2006. Speed held the record for most appearances until 14 February 2009, when goalkeeper David James played his 536th match, for Portsmouth against his former team Manchester City. James ended with 572 appearances, a record which was broken by Ryan Giggs on 14 May 2011, having played all of his matches for Manchester United. On 25 September 2017, Gareth Barry broke Giggs' record by playing his 633rd match, West Bromwich Albion's 2–0 loss at Arsenal. At the time of breaking the record, Barry ranked 8th in English top division appearances since the Second World War, trailing Giggs in 6th (672 total top division appearances) and six other players. Barry is the youngest of the 13 players to have achieved the feat. Giggs (Manchester United), Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher (both Liverpool) are the only three players to have achieved the accolade of 500+ Premier League appearances exclusively for one club. James Milner plays for his sixth club, which is the most of anyone in the 500 Club. Emile Heskey, David James and Milner each played for five Premier League clubs on their way to 500+ Premier League games, more than anyone else who succeeded this feat. The only player from outside the United Kingdom to play 500 Premier League games is Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, for Middlesbrough, Fulham, Chelsea and Leicester City. Of the still active players in the Premier League, Ashley Young is closest to joining the 500 Club. The Everton defender has 443 Premier League appearances as of 10 March 2024 (20 for Watford, 210 for Aston Villa and 192 for Manchester United). Manchester City's Kyle Walker is next with 389 matches played in the Premier League. Players are initially listed by number of appearances.
