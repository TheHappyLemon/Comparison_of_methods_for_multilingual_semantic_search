After that, club performance was not good, he also played in Division 2. He retired in 1992. He played 192 games and scored 65 goals in the league. On November 19, 1978, when Hara was a Waseda University student, he debuted for Japan national team against Soviet Union. He also played at 1978 Asian Games and 1982 World Cup qualification in 1980. From 1981, he played most matches of Japan national team until 1988. He played 75 games and scored 37 goals for Japan until 1987. He was known for his headers and was aptly nicknamed the "Asian Nuclear Warhead". Hara retired from playing career in 1992 and began his new career as the coach of the youth team of his old club, which had been renamed by this point as Urawa Reds. In 1998 Hara became the manager of Urawa's top squad. Initially he saw success, with the team achieving a 3rd place finish for J.League's second stage in 1998. However, during J.League's first stage of 1999, the team finished 13th in the standings and Hara was released. Following his release from Urawa, Hara travelled to Spain to study the coaching methods applied by several La Liga clubs. Upon returning to Japan, he spent two years working as a commentator for Sky PerfecTV!. In 2002 Hara decided to return to coaching as the manager of FC Tokyo. He brought youngsters such as Naohiro Ishikawa, Teruyuki Moniwa and Akira Kaji, introduced Spanish-style tactics into the young and fresh team, and won J.League Cup in 2004. Hara was released from his position as manager of the club in 2005. However in 2007 he was re-appointed as the club's manager, but was again released only after one season. On 12 February 2009, Hara was appointed by Japan Football Association as its new technical director for the Japan national team, responsible for strengthening the national team. After fellow Waseda alumnus Takeshi Okada stepped down after leading Japan to a lauded performance at the 2010 World Cup, Hara was given the responsibility for finding his replacement, which was revealed in late August after protracted negotiations in Europe to be the Italian manager Alberto Zaccheroni. He also took charge in a caretaker capacity for the friendlies against Paraguay, leading Japan to a 1-0 win, and Guatemala, both of which were held at his former hunting ground in Saitama Stadium 2002.
