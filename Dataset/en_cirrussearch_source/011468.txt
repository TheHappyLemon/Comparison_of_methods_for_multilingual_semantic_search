The Great Britain men's national ice hockey team (also known as Team GB) is the national ice hockey team that represents the United Kingdom. A founding member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) in 1908, the team is controlled by Ice Hockey UK. The team was a force on the international scene in the early 20th century, winning the first ever IIHF European Championship in 1910, finishing as bronze medalists at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France, and becoming Olympic champions in 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The gold medal-winning Olympic team was composed primarily of dual-national British Canadians, many of whom having learned and played the game in Canada. However, since then the national team has made little impact on the sport. Until they surprisingly qualified for the 2019 installment of the tournament, their last appearance in the top-level World Championship came in 1994. Great Britain last qualified for the Olympics in 1948. The current head coach of the team is Peter Russell, who is also the head coach for the Cardiff Devils. Note: Between 1920 and 1968, the Olympic ice hockey tournament was also considered the World Championship for that year. Note: World War II forced cancellation of all tournaments from 1940 to 1946. Note: In 1972, a separate tournament was held both for the World Championships and the Winter Olympics for the first time. Note: No World Championships were held during the Olympic years 1980, 1984, and 1988. Note: the 2020 tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
