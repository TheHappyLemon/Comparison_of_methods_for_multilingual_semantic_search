The FIBA EuroCup Challenge was the 4th-tier level transnational professional continental club basketball competition in Europe, organised by FIBA Europe. The competition was founded in 2003 following a conflict between FIBA Europe and ULEB during the 2001-02 season, as an attempt by FIBA to expand their secondary tournament held during the previous season, the FIBA Europe Regional Challenge Cup by merging it with the FIBA Europe Champions Cup The competition ultimately ceased in 2007. Each season's finalists were promoted to the next season's more prestigious 3rd-tier level competition, the FIBA EuroChallenge. In 2002 FIBA Europe abolished its two main club tournaments, the FIBA Saporta Cup and the FIBA Korac Cup and invited European teams to join their two newly formed competitions, the FIBA Europe Champions Cup and the FIBA Europe Regional Challenge Cup, which would function as FIBA's premium and secondary-tier tournaments, respectively, in an attempt to compete against the newly formed EuroLeague, already run by ULEB since 2001. However, the revived Champions Cup never became a true rival to the ULEB Euroleague, and FIBA therefore decided that a pan-European competition, on top of the previous season's regional competition, would be organised for the 2003-2004 season. The FIBA Europe League was launched in 2003 as its top competition and the FIBA Europe Champions Cup ultimately merged with FIBA's second-tier tournament, the FIBA Europe Regional Challenge Cup to form the FIBA Europe Cup, which instead functioned as FIBA Europe's second-tier tournament and the fourth-tier overall in the European pyramid. The competition was played during the 2002–03 to 2006–07 seasons. It was variously known as the FIBA Europe Championship Cup / FIBA Europe Regional Challenge Cup (2002–03), the FIBA Europe Cup (2003–05), and the FIBA EuroCup Challenge (2005–07). Overall during those five season several historic European clubs played in the competition, such as ASK Riga, Fenerbahçe, KK Split, BC Khimki, EKA AEL, Bayer Giants Leverkusen, Azovmash Mariupol, PAOK, Hapoel Jerusalem, Lietuvos Rytas, BK Ventspils, Ural Great Perm, Belenenses, PBC Academic, UNICS, Prokom, Dinamo Bucharest, Benetton Fribourg etc. FiBA Europe Champions Cup / FIBA Europe Regional Challenge Cup: (2002–2003) FIBA Europe Cup: (2003–2005) FIBA EuroCup Challenge: (2005–2007) FIBA Europe Regional Challenge Cup: North Conference: 2002–03 Mariupol Volodymyr Gurtovyy, Andriy Kapinos, Andriy Botichev, Oleksandr Skutyelnik, Igor Kharchenko, Sergiy Moskalenko, Petro Podtykan, Yevhenii Annienkov, Dmytro Briantsev (Head Coach: Andrij Podkovyrov) South Conference: 2002–03 EKA AEL Limassol Dimitris Prokopiou, Marcos Asonitis, Georgios Kouzapas, Michalis Kounounis, Davor Kurilic, Konstantinos Perentos, Ranko Velimirovic, David Michael Van Dyke, Christos Spyrou, Duane Woodward (Head Coach: Dragan Raca).
