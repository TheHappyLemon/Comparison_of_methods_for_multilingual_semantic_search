Fire fighting was a contested event at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. Competitions were held for both professional and volunteer firefighters. Like all events held at the 1900 Games, the fire fighting event was considered part of the 1900 World's Fair. Fire fighting events have not been classified as official, although the IOC has never decided which events were "Olympic" and which were not. There was no such designation at the time of the Games. The American report of the 1900 Games, prepared by AG Spalding, devotes a whole page to the competition, which was won by Kansas City and "its famous engine and hook and ladder company No.1".[citation needed] Lennartz, Karl; Teutenberg, Walter (1995).

In many works, it is read that the IOC later met to decide which events were Olympic and which were not. This is not correct and no decision has ever been made. No discussion of this item can be found in the account of any Session. Mallon, Bill (1998). The 1900 Olympic Games, Results for All Competitors in All Events, with Commentary.
