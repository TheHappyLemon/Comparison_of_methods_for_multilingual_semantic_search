UEFA Euro 2004 was a football tournament that took place in Portugal between 12 June and 4 July 2004. The 16 teams that qualified for the competition were required to submit a final 23-man squad by 2 June 2004, although injured squad members could be replaced at any time up to 24 hours before their team's first match. The players' ages, clubs and caps are accurate as of 12 June 2004, the tournament's opening day. Manager: Otto Rehhagel Greece named their final squad on 23 May 2004. Manager: Luiz Felipe Scolari Portugal named their final squad on 18 May 2004. Manager: Georgi Yartsev Russia named their final squad on 2 June 2004.

On 6 June, midfielder Johann Lonfat was withdrawn from the squad after suffering a back injury; he was originally going to be replaced by Juventus forward Davide Chiumiento, but he declined the selection in favour of waiting for a call-up by Italy, meaning that Tranquillo Barnetta replaced Lonfat instead.
