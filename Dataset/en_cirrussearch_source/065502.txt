Paraná (Spanish pronunciation: [paɾaˈna]) is the capital city of the Argentine province Entre Ríos, located on the eastern shore of the Paraná River, opposite the city of Santa Fe, capital of the neighbouring Santa Fe Province. The city has a population of 247,863 (2010 census [INDEC]). During the 16th century, inhabitants of the city of Santa Fe settled at the other shore of the Paraná river.

Paraná is not only the head of the provincial government, but also an important river port for the transshipment of cereals, cattle, fish, and lumber from the surrounding region. The principal industries installed are the manufacture of cement, furniture, and ceramics. The city center brings together colonial churches, European styles seen in structures like the 3 de Febrero Theatre or the Government House, the blended architectural styles of the city's Cathedral, and modern towers, such as those found near Parque Urquiza park. The city is connected to the city of Santa Fe on the other side of the Entre Ríos by the Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel inaugurated in 1969.
