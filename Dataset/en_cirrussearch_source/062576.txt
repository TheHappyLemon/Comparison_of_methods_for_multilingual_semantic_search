Dirty Redd was killed in a car accident in 2014, and White talked to Rolling Stone about the time following the fatal accident. White grew up in Canton, though he moved to Columbus, Ohio, several times. His interest in music began when his mother played Ashanti, Beyoncé, Tupac, and Nas while White was growing up. He later listened to artists such as T-Pain, Kiss, Nirvana, Gucci Mane, Fountains of Wayne, the Ataris, Green Day, the Offspring, Cute Is What We Aim For, Simple Plan, the Summer Set, Hit the Lights, Marilyn Manson and Lil Wayne.

White began taking his music career seriously and began recording music, releasing "Sub-Zero" and "New Ferrari" in 2014 but soon deleting those songs. Following his high school graduation, White moved to Atlanta, where he met rapper Lil Wop and was eventually offered a deal with a record label. Lil Wop helped White get started with a professional recording studio.

White went on to release A Love Letter to You 4 that November. The mixtape debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming his first chart-topping album. Following this, White featured on several songs in the first half of 2020.

On June 18, which was his 21st birthday, he released another single titled "Dreamer", a single for Neon Shark, the deluxe edition of Pegasus, which would be his "rock album".

On April 13, 2017, 6ix9ine featured on White's song "Poles 1469" and in July 2017, he was also featured on White's song "Owee". Following a post from a Twitter account claiming 6ix9ine was a pedophile, White denounced 6ix9ine. On November 11, 2017, White was attacked in a New York hotel and claimed that a member of 6ix9ine's team ambushed him. 6ix9ine later insinuated his involvement. In February 2018, 6ix9ine was assaulted by several men outside of a Los Angeles airport shortly after arguing with White on Instagram. 6ix9ine and White continued to trade insults over social media in February 2018 and March 2018. In May 2018, 6ix9ine started a feud with rapper Tadoe and Chief Keef over allegations that Tadoe had abused artist Cuban Doll for talking to 6ix9ine. White supported Tadoe in the feud and went on to release a diss track toward 6ix9ine, "I Kill People", featuring Tadoe and Chief Keef. 6ix9ine also accused White of having sexual relations with fellow rapper Danielle Bregoli, also known as Bhad Bhabie, who was a minor at the time. White and Bregoli denied the accusation, but the latter admitted that the two had kissed in the past: "We kissed but it wasn't that serious and he was 17 at the time." On September 17, 2019, 6ix9ine has stated in a testimony that White has been involved with the Five Nine Brims gang. In October 2017, a preview of Drake's song "God's Plan" was shown on social media. The song originally featured White singing the hook and giving an additional verse. Florida rapper Jahseh Onfroy, known by his stage name XXXTentacion, who had prior issues with Drake, began to associate with 6ix9ine, to White's chagrin. In March 2018, Onfroy "banned" White from Florida, promising to assault him if he attempted to enter the state. Onfroy apologized to White during a performance later that month and the two reconciled after White accepted his apology. White and Onfroy went on to collaborate on multiple occasions. Following XXXTentacion's death on June 18, 2018, which was also White's 19th birthday, White dyed his hair in memory of the artist and released "Ghost Busters", a collaboration with Quavo, XXXTentacion, and Ski Mask the Slump God in memoriam. In a 2021 interview, White said that he still thought about XXXTentacion every day. On White's 2021 album Trip At Knight, a posthumous reworked version of "Ghost Busters" with White and XXXTentacion entitled "Danny Phantom" was released. White said in March 2018 that he was worth $7 million and purchased his mother a $300,000 house. In 2022, White signed a $30 million record deal with 10K Projects. After signing the deal, he purchased a $7.5 million Florida mansion. White stated via Instagram in November 2023 that he has a son. White was arrested in Cobb County, Georgia, following an assault on rapper FDM Grady in late May 2018. According to Grady, White and rapper Lil Wop insulted Grady's girlfriend, leading Grady to draw a firearm briefly before engaging in a fist fight with White. At that point, Grady was attacked by four men including White and Wop. White was arrested on charges of affray (public fighting), criminal trespass and simple battery. A few weeks later in early June, White was again arrested in Georgia on an assault charge for allegedly pistol-whipping a woman. Life's a Trip (2018) !
