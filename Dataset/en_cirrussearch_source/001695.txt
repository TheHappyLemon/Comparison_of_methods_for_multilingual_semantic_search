Ros Casares Godella was a professional women's basketball team based in Godella, Spain. It played in the Liga Femenina de Baloncesto between 1996 and 2012, when it resigned to play in EuroLeague and Spanish League. It continued playing in Primera División Femenina, third tier of Spanish women's basketball, until 2014 when the club was integrated in Valencia Basket as its women's section. The club was founded in 1996 as Popular Bàsquet Godella. In 1998, the construction company Ros Casares acquired the team and in 2001 the club won its first league with this denomination. The following season defended the title, won its first national cup and made its debut in the EuroLeague. In subsequent years the team became a regular in the EuroLeague and fought tightly with UB Barcelona, which disappeared in 2007. That season marked the beginning of Ros Casares' golden era, with four national doubles in a row and two EuroLeague finals lost to Spartak Moscow Region. Following an unsuccessful 2010–11 season where Ros Casares lost the national titles to Perfumerías Avenida and Rivas Ecópolis the team was greatly strengthened and it won the 2012 EuroLeague by beating UMMC Ekaterinburg, Spartak Moscow Region, Wisła Kraków and finally Rivas Ecópolis in the new Final Eight, in addition to its eighth national championship. However, the club announced it would be disbanded just two months later, but finally continued playing in lower divisions. In May 2014, Ros Casares agreed all the teams of the club will be integrated in Valencia Basket since the 2014–15 season.
