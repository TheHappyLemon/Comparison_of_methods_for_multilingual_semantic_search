May 5: Lunar eclipse, in which the moon became totally dark according to the Peterborough Chronicle, due to an earlier volcanic eruption putting aerosols into the upper atmosphere of the earth, thus cutting off the earthlight. Second Chola invasion of Kalinga Spring – Mawdud ibn Altuntash, Turkic ruler (atabeg) of Mosul, leads an expedition to capture the territories of the Crusaders (belonging to the County of Edessa) east of the Euphrates River. He besieges the fortress city of Edessa, but is forced to retreat, when King Baldwin I of Jerusalem (with the support of Armenian forces sent by Kogh Vasil) intervenes with a Crusader relief force. February – May – The Crusaders under Baldwin I besiege Beirut. The Genoese and Pisan ships blockade the harbour, Fatimid ships from Tyre and Sidon try in vain to break the blockade. The Fatimid governor flees by night through the Italian fleet to Cyprus. On May 13, Baldwin captures the city by assault. The Italians conduct a massacre among the inhabitants. October – December – The Crusaders under Baldwin I (supported by King Sigurd I) besiege Sidon. Norwegian ships blockade the harbour – but are nearly dispersed by a powerful Fatimid flotilla from Tyre. They are saved by the arrival of a Venetian squadron under Doge Ordelafo Faliero. On December 4, the city capitulates (under notable terms) to Baldwin. December – Tancred, Italo-Norman prince of Galilee, brings the Crusader castle Krak des Chevaliers in Syria under his control. He remains regent of the Principality of Antioch in the name of his cousin Bohemond II. King Henry V invades Italy with a large army and concludes an agreement with Pope Paschal II at Sutri. Henry renounces the right of investiture (a dispute with the former Henry IV). In return, Paschal promises to crown him emperor and to restore to the Holy Roman Empire all the lands given to the German church (since the time of Charlemagne). July 25 – Henry V marries the 8-year-old Matilda (daughter of King Henry I of England). She is crowned Queen of the Romans in a ceremony at Mainz. After the betrothal Matilda is placed into custody of Bruno, archbishop of Trier, who is tasked with educating her in German culture, manners and government. The dukedom of Bohemia is secured for Vladislaus I following the death of Svatopluk (the Lion) who is assassinated. Vladislaus receives support from Henry V and will rule until 1125. Almoravid forces under Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf occupy Zaragoza (modern Spain), bringing all of Andalusia's Muslim states under Almoravid control.
