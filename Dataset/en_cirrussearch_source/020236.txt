Juan Carlos I Antarctic Base, named after the former king of Spain, Juan Carlos I (Spanish: Base Antártica Española Juan Carlos Primero), is a seasonal (November to March) scientific station operated by Spain, opened in January 1988. Situated on Hurd Peninsula, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. The base is controlled by the Marine Technology Unit of the Spanish National Research Council and is 20 miles away from the Spanish Antarctic base Gabriel de Castilla. The base has undergone several renovations, the closest remodeling was completed in 2018 and it was inaugurated by the Science Minister, Pedro Duque, on February 2, 2019. This latest renovation involved the construction of "new facilities [that] have allowed it to double its capacity, up to 51 people, and increase the space available for scientific and technical personnel in laboratories." The base is on the coast of Española Cove, South Bay, in the northern foothills of Mount Reina Sofía, and 2.7 km south-southwest of the Bulgarian base St. Kliment Ohridski. The two bases are linked by a 5.5 km overland route via Johnsons Glacier, Charrúa Gap, Contell Glacier and Krum Rock.
