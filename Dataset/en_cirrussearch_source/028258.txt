The town is situated on the Lutoninka River. The first written mention of Vizovice is from 1261, when it was owned by the newly established Smilheim monastery. During the Hussite Wars, the monastery and the village were badly damaged and looted. In 1483, the estate was acquired by the lords of Kunštát, and in 1485 the Cistercian monastery was definitely abolished. In 1567, the estate was bought by Zdeněk Kavka of Říčany, who had built a Renaissance residence called Nový Smilheim in the fortified area of the abolished monastery. Vizovice received town privileges in 1570. In the second half of the 17th century, the estate became a property of the Gollen family. Shortly after, the town and the castle were burned down by Turkish invaders. In 1750–1770, during the rule of Count Hermann Hannibal of Blümegen, a new Baroque castle with French and English garden was built. Vizovice has long history of the alcohol production. A distillery in Vizovice was first documented in 1585. The local climate is suitable for fruit trees, especially plums, and in the mid-18th century, slivovitz started being produced here. The Rudolf Jelínek distillery was founded here in 1882. The annual Masters of Rock heavy metal festival takes place in Vizovice. The Vizovice Castle is the main landmark.
