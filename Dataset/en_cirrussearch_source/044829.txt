Ben 10: Omniverse is an American animated television series and the fourth installment of the Ben 10 franchise (and the final series in the original continuity), which aired on Cartoon Network from September 22, 2012, to November 14, 2014, in the United States, across eight 10-episode serialised "story arcs" instead of a season-based episode release structure. Man of Action Studios, consisting of Duncan Rouleau, Joe Casey, Joe Kelly, and Steven T. Seagle, created the franchise. The series was announced at Cartoon Network's Upfront in 2011. Concept art, described as a homage to the original Ben 10 series, designed by Derrick J. Wyatt (Transformers: Animated and Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated) was first unveiled at the 2012 UK Toy Fair. The series premiered on September 22, 2012, with a "sneak peek episode" that aired on August 1, 2012. A "sneak peek" of the series aired after "Ben 10 Week" (March 19, 2012 – March 24, 2012). The show was followed by a reboot of the franchise in 2016. The series follows the adventures of sixteen-year-old Ben Tennyson, wielder of the Omnitrix, an extremely powerful watch-style device that allows Ben to change into a multitude of various aliens; each with their own special abilities and skills. The storylines alternate between that of eleven-year-old Ben (one year after the original series) and sixteen-year-old Ben (a few months after Ben 10: Ultimate Alien). After Gwen leaves for college and Kevin leaves to be closer to her, Ben gets a new partner, a rookie by-the-book alien plumber named Rook Blonko (surname first). On a mission to explore a secret underground alien city named Undertown, Ben explores the quirkier side of things in the alien underground and discovers that enemies from his past are looking for a rematch. In "T.G.I.S.", it is revealed that the Ben 10 universe shares the same universe with The Secret Saturdays.

A possible unintentional leak of official images of the line was released on the website of department store Kmart. Figures that were revealed at Toy Fairs such as Bloxx, Shocksquatch, 16-year-old Ben Tennyson, an 11-year-old version of Ben, and Ben's sidekick Rook were listed on the website. The vehicle play set, "Rook's Truck", has won an award for Best Action Figures/Accessories at the 2012 London Toy Fair. The Omnitrix Touch has a gray color instead of the white it features in the show. A video game of the same name is developed by Vicious Cycle Studios for the Wii U, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and by 1st Playable Productions for the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DS. The action beat 'em up features 15 playable characters on DS and 3DS and 16 playable characters on the other systems. It also features a two-player co-op play. The game follows Ben and Rook in a battle to defeat a fierce villain, named Malware, who has evil plans of destroying the world. Omniverse also spawned a second video game, which was developed by High Voltage Software for the Wii U, Wii, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 and by 1st Playable Productions for the Nintendo 3DS. This game takes place during the events of Frogs of War, where Ben must fight the Incurseans to get back to Earth and stop Emperor Milleous, Attea, Dr. Psychobos, and the Way Bads.
