Bouna Junior Sarr (born 31 January 1992) is a professional footballer who plays as a right back and winger for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich. Born in France, he plays for the Senegal national team. Sarr signed for Marseille on 7 July 2015. On 12 April 2018, he scored his first goal in European competitions in a 5–2 win over RB Leipzig in the Europa League quarter-final second leg. On 3 May, he played in the Europa League semi-finals away to Red Bull Salzburg as Marseille played out a 1–2 away loss but a 3–2 aggregate win to secure a place in the 2018 UEFA Europa League Final, which was played at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Décines-Charpieu, Lyon, France on 16 May 2018, against Atlético Madrid. On 5 October 2020, Sarr signed for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich on a four-year deal. Sarr made his debut for Bayern in the first round of the DFB-Pokal on 15 October and provided two assists to fellow new signing Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting as the club defeated fifth division side 1. FC Düren by a score of 3–0. On 25 August 2021, he scored his first goal for the club in the same competition, in the first round of the following season, in a 12–0 hammering of fifth division club Bremer SV. On 6 May 2023, he featured in his only match of the 2022–23 season after 424 days of his last match, coming off the bench in the 88th minute, in a 2–1 away win over Werder Bremen. On 26 September, he played his first match of the following season, where he provided an assist in a 4–0 away win over Preußen Münster in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 November, he made his first start since April 2021, in a 4–2 victory over Heidenheim. Later that year, on 1 December, he had surgery on his torn ACL in his left knee, which would force him to be sidelined for several months. Sarr was born in France to a Senegalese father and a Guinean mother. He was called up by the Guinea national team in December 2014, but he did not play for them. In late April 2018, he was approached by the Senegal national team and turned down the offer. However, Sarr decided to represent Senegal as he was called up in late September 2021 by Aliou Cissé for the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Namibia, Togo and Congo. He debuted with Senegal in a 4–1 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification win over Namibia on 9 October 2021. Sarr was called up for the Senegal national team to compete in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, where he played every match, eventually winning in the final against Egypt. He was appointed a Grand Officer of the National Order of the Lion by President of Senegal Macky Sall following the nation's victory at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. In September 2022, he had a knee surgery which forced him to miss the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
