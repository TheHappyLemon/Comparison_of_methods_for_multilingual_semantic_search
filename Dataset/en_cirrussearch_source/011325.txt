He returned to HPK mid-season, only to continue to Skellefteå AIK in the Swedish Elitserien later in the season. He played two more seasons in HPK until 2010 and had seasons of 47 and 30 points. He was then selected to the national team for the 2010 IIHF World Championship for the first time in his career.
