The 3rd unofficial Chess Olympiad was held by German Chess Federation (Grossdeutscher Schachbund) as a counterpart of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin with reference to 1924 and 1928 events. Many Jewish chess players took part in the event. Significantly, the "Jewish" teams of Hungary (i.e. Lajos Steiner, Endre Steiner, László Szabó, Ernő Gereben, Kornél Havasi) and Poland (i.e. Paulino Frydman, Miguel Najdorf, Henryk Friedman, Leon Kremer, Henryk Pogorieły) beat "Aryan" Germany. Also Jewish masters from other countries played leading roles there (i.e. Movsas Feigins, Gunnar Friedemann, Imre König, Lodewijk Prins, Isakas Vistaneckis, Emil Zinner, etc.). The Schach-Olympia 1936 took place in Munich between August 17 and September 1, 1936. In that extra-Olympiad (non-FIDE) 208 participants, representing 21 countries, played 1680 games. The Munich unofficial Olympiad was the biggest team competition ever held. 1st unofficial Chess Olympiad (Paris 1924) 2nd unofficial Chess Olympiad (Budapest 1926) Against Chess Olympiad (Tripoli 1976) OlimpBase :: Chess Olympiad, Munich 1936, information Edward Winter: The 1936 Munich Chess Olympiad Stanisław Gawlikowski: Olimpiady szachowe 1924-1974, Wyd.
