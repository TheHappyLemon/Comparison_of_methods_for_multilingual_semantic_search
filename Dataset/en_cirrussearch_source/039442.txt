Aizawl (English: /aɪˈzɔːl/; Mizo: [ˈaɪ̯.ˈzɔːl] , formerly romanised as Aijal) is the capital of the state of Mizoram. It was officially established on 25 February 1890 as Fort Aijal during the British rule. With a population of 293,416, it is the largest city in the state. It is also the centre of administration containing all the important government offices, namely the state's Assembly House and civil secretariat. In 1871–72, the disorderly conduct of Khalkom, a Mizo Chief, compelled the British to establish an outpost that later became the Aizawl Village. The post had been established by Suakpuilala, the Chief of Reiek and it was only 14 kilometres from Sairang from where one could travel by flat bottomed boat. In 1890, Officer Dally of the Assam Police and his 400 men arrived at Aizawl to support Colonel Skinner's troops during a British military operation against the Mizo tribals.[citation needed] On Dally's recommendation, Aizawl was selected as the site of a fortified post that Colonel Skinner had been ordered to construct. The troops constructed stockades and buildings at the site. The Indian Air Force carried out air strikes on the town during the March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising, following which the MNF withdrew to Lunglei.
