It is currently owned and operated by Afghan Invest Co., and operated by Ahmad Javid Jaihoon. The limestone is mined from the hill behind the factory. There is a coal mine outside of the city in the village Kar-kar, but the production system is archaic. Agriculture is very important because of the rain and temperature; wheat, spices, and rice are the main crops. The lead nation of the local Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) was Hungary, which operated in the city from 2006 to March 2013[citation needed]. Previous to 2006, the lead nation was the Netherlands. Electrical transmission lines built from Puli Khumri are now[when?] bringing a steady supply of electricity to Kabul.
