During the off season, Radwańska switched her racquet make from Babolat to Srixon. She began the year at the Shenzhen Open as the top seed and defending champion, where she reached the quarterfinal before losing to Alison Riske. The following week, she reached the final at Sydney International defeating Christina McHale, Duan Yingying, and Barbora Strýcová before losing to Johanna Konta. Seeded third at the Australian Open she defeated Tsvetana Pironkova. In the second round she lost to the eventual semifinalist Mirjana Lučić-Baroni. Following a second round loss to Caroline Wozniacki at the Qatar Open, Radwańska competed at the Dubai Tennis Championships. As the fourth seed, she received a bye into the second round where she defeated Belgian qualifier Elise Mertens in straight sets. She lost to Catherine Bellis in the third round. In March, Radwańska celebrated her 28th birthday as she prepared for the Indian Wells Open. At the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, she defeated Sara Sorribes Tormo before losing to Peng Shuai in the third round. Next she competed in the Miami Open, where she defeated Wang Qiang in straight sets for a rematch with the Australian Open semifinalist Mirjana Lučić-Baroni. Lučić-Baroni defeated Radwańska for a second time in 2017, this time for the loss of just three games. In April, Radwańska began her clay season at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix as the 7th seed. She lost in straight sets to Ekaterina Makarova in the first round. She later withdrew from her forthcoming tournaments in Madrid and Rome, citing a foot injury. At the French Open Radwańska was seeded at No.9. In her first match after being sidelined for five weeks due to a right foot injury she eased past Fiona Ferro in straight sets in just over an hour. In the second round she defeated Belgium's Alison Van Uytvanck to face Alizé Cornet in the third round. Radwańska had won seven of their eight previous matches, including the only one on clay – at the French Open nine years ago – but this time lost to Cornet in two sets. Radwańska withdrew from the Ricoh Open and Birmingham Classic due to a viral illness. She came into the Eastbourne International as the No. 9 seed but fell to Lauren Davis. Radwańska then started her Wimbledon Championships campaign where she defeated Jelena Janković, Christina McHale and Timea Bacsinszky before falling to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round. Radwańska began her summer hard-court season at the Rogers Cup in Toronto, Canada, where she defeated CoCo Vandeweghe and Tímea Babos before falling to Caroline Wozniacki in the third round. As the defending champion and top seed at the Connecticut Open she defeated Eugenie Bouchard and Peng Shuai before losing to Daria Gavrilova in her second semifinal of the season. This result saw her fall out of the top 10 for the first time since 2015. Following New Haven Open Radwańska entered US Open, where she was seeded 10th. She defeated Petra Martić and Yulia Putintseva in straight sets to advance to the third round. In the third round she lost a tight 3-hour/3 set match to CoCo Vandeweghe. Radwańska was forced out of the Pan Pacific Open tournament in Tokyo due to a bout of flu. At the Wuhan Open, she scored her fifth career win over Wimbledon semifinalist Magdaléna Rybáriková in the first round. She defeated Julia Görges in the second round, claiming her 500th main draw victory on the WTA. Radwańska avenged her straight-set loss to Görges earlier this year, at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati, and increased her head-to-head record against the German to four wins and two losses. A quarterfinalist in Wuhan last year, Radwańska lost to the eventual finalist, Ashleigh Barty in the third round, after the Australian dispatched No. 5 seed Johanna Konta. Radwańska began her title defense at the China Open with two straight-sets victories over Carina Witthöft and Zhang Shuai before falling to Daria Kasatkina in a third-round three set meeting. Radwańska ended her season ranked 28th, her worst since 2005, following a second round defeat in Hong Kong to Samantha Stosur. At the end of the season Radwańska won the 2017 Shot of the Year for the fifth time in a row. She turned defense to offense in a stunning way to thwart a would-be winner from Julia Görges during their match at Wuhan Open. Radwańska began the year at the Auckland Open where as the fourth seed, she defeated Beatriz Haddad Maia and Taylor Townsend but lost to qualifier Sachia Vickery in the quarterfinal. She then competed at the Sydney International, overpowering the defending champion Johanna Konta and Catherine Bellis to advance to the quarterfinal, where she lost to Camila Giorgi. This loss caused Radwańska to fall out of the top 30 for the first time since 2007 since she was unable to defend her finalist points at the tournament. Radwańska was seeded 26th at the Australian Open. She reached the third round, after defeating Kristýna Plíšková and Lesia Tsurenko, but lost to Hsieh Su-wei, who beat Garbiñe Muguruza in the second round.[citation needed] Radwańska made it three three-set victories in a row over Mona Barthel to make a winning start to her Qatar Open campaign. She ultimately needed 10 match points, but avoided the tiebreak and finally closed out the match after two hours and 26 minutes. "I’d rather not talk about those ten match points!" Radwańska joked. "The important thing is I won the tenth one". In the second round, Radwańska lost to the eventual champion Petra Kvitová in three sets. At Dubai, Radwańska lost to eventual finalist Daria Kasatkina in the opening round. Her next tournament was the Indian Wells Open where she received a bye into the second round. There, she lost to the eventual champion Naomi Osaka, who defeated unseeded Maria Sharapova in her opening match.[citation needed] At the Miami Open, Radwańska made a promising start, defeating world No. 1, Simona Halep, in three sets. This victory marked Radwańska's second career win over a world No. 1, and the first since 2012. She extended her great record in Miami, too; reaching the round of 16 or better in ten of her 12 appearances. Radwańska ended her run in Miami with a loss to Victoria Azarenka in the fourth round. After Miami, she was promoted from 32nd to 30th in the WTA ranking.[citation needed] Radwańska opened her clay-court season in Istanbul where she retired in the first-round match to Donna Vekić. It was later revealed that Radwańska hurt her back the day before during a training session. Subsequently, she withdrew from the Mutua Madrid Open and French Open due to a back injury. Radwańska made a winning return from injury against Tímea Babos in the first round of the Nature Valley International. Despite missing a Grand Slam event for the first time in over a decade, dating back to the 2006 French Open, the former world No. 2 looked as though she'd never left over the course of 66 minutes on the Eastbourne lawns. Radwańska, unseeded in Eastbourne, defeated No. 15 seed Daria Gavrilova to face Petra Kvitová in the third round. Since Petra Kvitová withdrew with a hamstring injury Radwańska automatically advanced to the quarterfinal where she defeated Jeļena Ostapenko to reach the semifinal. In the semifinal, she lost to Aryna Sabalenka in three sets. At Wimbledon, she defeated Elena-Gabriela Ruse in a close three-set match, saving six match points and reeling off the last three games in a row to book her place in the second round. In the 2nd round she played Lucie Šafářová, to whom she lost in straight sets. For the first time in her career Radwańska lost to Karolína Plíšková in the first round of the 2018 Western & Southern Open, bringing their head-to-head to 7–1 against the Czech. Next she played at the Connecticut Open where she lost to Petra Kvitová in the opening round. For the first time in over a decade, Radwańska came into a Grand Slam main draw outside the top 32 seeds. Unseeded at the US Open, she lost to Tatjana Maria, in the first round. Radwańska progressed to the second round of the Korea Open thanks to a two set victory over Bethanie Mattek-Sands. In a clash of two former winners of the Korea Open, 2013 champion Radwańska lost to the 2015 champion Irina-Camelia Begu in the second round. Due to her ongoing struggles with injuries Radwańska withdrew from the China Open tournament, thus ending the season early with a 14–14 singles record. By the end of the season, Radwańska fell to the 78th position in the ranking – the lowest since 2006, when she made her debut in the WTA series. On 14 November 2018, Radwańska announced her retirement from professional tennis. "Taking into consideration my health and the heavy burdens of professional tennis, I have to concede that I’m not able to push my body to the limits required," she wrote on her Facebook account. Radwańska participated in the Fed Cup from 2006 to the present. She played a total of 48 Fed Cup matches with 41 wins and 7 losses. For her achievements she was presented with two Fed Cup Heart Awards. "I think it's great to play Fed Cup", said Radwańska, "I’ve been playing for the last couple of years and I really think it helped my team to go up and, you know, I’m very happy about it and I’m always ready to play". As member of the Poland Fed Cup team Radwańska participated in 2014 Fed Cup World Group play-offs. In Barcelona she led Poland to a 3–2 win over Spain, which allowed Poland to advance to 2015 Fed Cup World Group for the first time in over twenty years. In over a decade of meetings, Radwańska and Caroline Wozniacki had a rivalry that ended 11–6 in Wozniacki's favour. Radwańska first scored a win against Wozniacki in July 2007 at the Nordic Light Open in Stockholm. She also defeated Wozniacki at the Sydney International, Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, and tournaments in Doha, Wuhan and Beijing. In August 2017 they faced each other for the last time at the Rogers Cup in Toronto, where Wozniacki beat Radwańska to advance to the quarter-finals. Radwańska had a rivalry with Russian player Vera Zvonareva, which began in 2007. It ended 4–2 in Radwańska's favour. Throughout their meetings, Radwańska proved able to match Zvonareva's pace and movements around the court. Zvonareva was considered the more powerful of the two, while Radwańska was noted as more focused at times, utilizing what Sports Illustrated's Courtney Nguyen dubbed "selective aggression" during the pair's 2011 matches. Their first match occurred during the 2007 Kremlin Cup, with Zvonareva winning in straight sets. The two did not play again until the 2011 season, when Radwańska won four of their five matches, including the finals of the Mercury Insurance Open and the Pan Pacific Open. Their final meeting of 2011 was an acclaimed match at the WTA Championships. Trailing 3–5 in the third set, Radwańska saved three match points and went on to win in three sets. The victory marked her fourth straight win against Zvonareva, whom she described as "very consistent and always tough to beat." Radwańska and Li Na first played in 2009. Li led the series 6–5. Radwańska won the three of their four matches on grass and their only meeting on clay. Li led the rivalry 5–1 on hard courts. Their matches included a victory each at Wimbledon: Radwańska winning in 2009 and Li in 2010. In 2012, Radwańska and Li met four times, with Li taking three victories. Li lost their meeting in the Stuttgart quarter-final in three sets, but dominated in Montréal, Cincinnati and Beijing. In 2013, both were undefeated that year when they met each other in the semi-finals at Sydney. Radwańska beat Li and eventually won the tournament. At the 2013 Australian Open, Li became the first player to defeat Radwańska that season, with a victory in the quarter-finals. Their last meeting came at Wimbledon that year, in the quarter-finals, with Radwańska winning in three sets. Radwańska and Ana Ivanovic had their first professional meeting in 2006. With Ana Ivanović having retired, Radwańska ended the series 7–3 ahead. The majority of their matches were played on hard courts. Radwańska lead their match-ups on clay. Radwańska versus Angelique Kerber has been described as one of the closest rivalries in women's tennis. The rivalry stretches back to their first meeting in 2008 Qatar Telecom German Open. Radwańska and Kerber were tied after winning 6 matches each. The players have played one match each on grass and clay, with Radwańska winning both. Kerber leads their head-to-head on hard courts 5–4. Their first meeting in 2015 at Bank of the West Classic took place at night, with Kerber winning in three sets. Radwańska and Svetlana Kuznetsova played each other eighteen times since 2007, with Radwańska trailing the head-to-head 4–14. Their first meeting was at Wimbledon in 2007 with Radwańska losing in straight sets. She lost their first three meetings, but in the four meetings that eventuated in 2008, she would win three of them, including in the third round of the Australian Open and in the fourth round of Wimbledon. Additionally, she also defeated her at the year-end championships later in the year after replacing an injured Ana Ivanovic during the round robin stage. Radwańska would later struggle in the rivalry, at one point losing six meetings in a row, including an upset loss at the 2012 French Open, before ending this losing streak at the 2014 Mutua Madrid Open, saving three match points in the process. Radwańska also lost to Kuznetsova in the two finals in which they met, first at Beijing in 2009 and then at San Diego in 2010. In 2015, Radwańska lost to Kuznetsova again in the opening match of Fed Cup tie between Russia and Poland. Their most recent meeting at the 2016 Wuhan Open saw Radwańska lose a three-set, quarter-final thriller after holding a match point in the second set. They met for the 17th time at the WTA Finals in Singapore, with Radwańska again wasting a match point in a three-set loss. Their most recent meeting, at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, saw Radwańska lose in straight sets, a decade on from their first meeting. Radwańska's game was founded on variety, mobility, and a tendency to anticipate her opponent's actions. She often used clever shot placement to construct rallies—either opening the court up for a winner, or prompting a surprised opponent to hit a misplaced return. Her primary weapons included a mixture of slices and lobs, along with her ability to hit the ball at a variety of angles. "In the years since I first joined the WTA Tour, people have called me 'Ninja' or 'The Professor,' and that's the greatest compliment because I want to make those shots that make people ask, 'How did she do that?'" —Radwańska in 2016 In 2012, Tom Perrotta of The Wall Street Journal called Radwańska "the most tactically sound, subtle tennis player in the world." Over the years she was given the nicknames "The Magician", "Ninja" and "The Professor", due to the fact that she can pull off the most difficult shots in the game with ease. She also makes use of a disguised drop shot, often swung with the same motion as a normal stroke during a rally. She is also noted for her crouching shots, during which she quickly drops in place to return or redirect a low ball, along with her use of an overhead backhand while on defense. In fact, she is known for having invented her distinctive squat position shot, where she sits so low on her haunches that she can play half-volleys with a horizontal racket. "I’m not sure if I invented it", says Radwańska, "but I was definitely one of the first ones. When I watch TV, I can hear commentators say that was my shot, even if someone else is playing, so it's nice to hear I can put something new into tennis". One of Radwańska's main weaknesses is her lack of power in her serve. Her serve, especially her second serve, is generally slow and vulnerable to attack. Her shots sometimes lack penetration on court, posing little threat to power hitters. "I don't think I can ever serve 200 kilometers per hour, it's just not my body," Radwańska said. "I have to do something else. I was just born to play like this. I have so many ideas. In your mind it's like, 'OK, I go down the line, then crosscourt, maybe drop shot.' But you have just one second, or even not one second, it just has to be automatic." Radwańska merely exhales when she strikes the ball, rather than loudly grunting like many of her peers. She bounces the ball no more than four times before serving. She says she can play with any racket and likes to use one for an entire match, unlike most players, who routinely grab frames with fresh strings. Tennis commentators, including former pro Wojciech Fibak, have compared her playing style to that of Martina Hingis, with Fibak describing her as "a natural mover who understands the geometry of the court". Radwańska cited Hingis as an inspiration. She and Hingis had their lone tour meeting in 2007, with Radwańska winning in three sets. Radwańska played with the Babolat Pure Drive Lite racquets until the end of the 2016 season. At the start of the 2017 season, beginning with the Shenzhen Open tournament, Radwańska started playing with a new tennis racket, made by the Japanese manufacturer, Srixon. Other tennis players who also use Srixon rackets include Kevin Anderson, Misaki Doi, Kurumi Nara, Zarina Diyas and Magda Linette. For her on court tennis apparel, Radwańska is currently sponsored by Lotto Sport Italia. Radwańska began her tennis career with her father, Robert Radwański, as her coach. She stated: "My dad was traveling with me all my life and we practiced together for 17 years, almost actually 18. So it's pretty long time." In 2011, Radwańska began working with Fed Cup coach Tomasz Wiktorowski, who replaced her father. Borna Bikić, a veteran coach on the WTA Tour, briefly joined them in 2012. Radwańska hired Martina Navratilova as part of her team at the conclusion of the 2014 season. In April 2015 they parted ways after Navratilova stated that she was too busy to continue in her part-time role as Radwańska's consulting coach. Since 2009, Radwańska and her sister Urszula have devoted time during the off-season to Szlachetna Paczka ("Noble Box"). The charity has its volunteers go door-to-door throughout the year compiling a database of families in need, asking them what would help ease the pressures of the holidays. Then, for a three-week period from mid-November to early December, donors are given a list to take with them to the supermarket, where they fill a shopping cart with the food, clothing and more to donate to them. Additionally, she and Urszula offer their support to Habitat for Humanity and its project in Warsaw. As Habitat for Humanity ambassador Radwańska stated, "It's an honor to be a part of such a fantastic cause and be involved with Habitat for Humanity, helping underprivileged families across the world. I have great respect for all the volunteers and those working hard everyday against poverty housing." On 23 July 2022 Radwańska participated in a charity tennis event in Kraków, Poland, organised by Iga Świątek to raise funds for children and teenagers impacted by the war in Ukraine. The one-day event featured a mixed doubles exhibition match and a set of singles between Świątek and Radwańska. Świątek later announced on Twitter that the event has raised over 2,5 mln złoty (over €500,000), which would be spread between United 24, Elina Svitolina Foundation and UNICEF Poland.
