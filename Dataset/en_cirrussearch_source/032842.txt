Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Australia accepted the convention on 22 August 1974. There are 20 World Heritage Sites in Australia, with a further six on the tentative list. The first sites in Australia added to the list were the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu National Park, and Willandra Lakes Region, at the fifth session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Sydney, in 1981. The most recent site listed was the Budj Bim Cultural Landscape, in 2019. Of these 20 sites, four are cultural, 12 are natural, and four are mixed, listed for both cultural and natural properties. Australia has served as a member of the World Heritage Committee five times, in 1976–1983, 1983–1989, 1995–2001, 2007–2011, and 2017–2021. UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural. In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Australia maintains six properties on its tentative list. * Transnational site Australia portal Oceania portal Tourism in Australia "The World Heritage Convention". UNESCO World Heritage Centre.
