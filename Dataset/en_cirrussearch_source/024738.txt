IAM Cycling was a Swiss registered UCI WorldTour cycling team. It is managed by former French road race champion Serge Beucherie. The title sponsor was IAM Independent Asset Management SA, a Swiss investment management company. The team was officially launched in January 2013. IAM Cycling is a member of the Mouvement pour un cyclisme crédible. IAM Cycling was selected as a wild-card entry for the 2013 Paris–Nice race. On 22 August 2013 the team announced that it had signed Sylvain Chavanel and Jérôme Pineau from Omega Pharma–Quick-Step, Mathias Frank from BMC Racing Team and Roger Kluge from NetApp–Endura for the 2014 season. On 28 January it was announced that IAM Cycling had been granted a "wild card" entry to Tour de France 2014, its first Grand Tour. It also raced the Vuelta a España. Subsequently, in December 2014 the UCI announced that the team would be granted a WorldTour licence for the 2015 season. In May 2016, the team announced they would fold at the end of the season due to not being able to secure a secondary sponsor.
