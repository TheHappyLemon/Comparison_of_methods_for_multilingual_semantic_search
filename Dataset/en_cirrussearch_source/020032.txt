The first written mention of Přelouč dates back to 1086 when the village became a part of the Benedictine monastery in Opatovice nad Labem. It was owned by the monastery for 300 years. In 1261, Přelouč was promoted to a market town by King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Since then, the town has used its coat of arms which consists of a black gridiron in the golden field. This symbol is associated with Saint Lawrence who lived in the 3rd century in Rome and was burnt alive on a gridiron. Because of the town's affiliation with the Benedictine monastery dedicated to Saint Lawrence, the town coat of arms includes the gridiron. Thanks to its location, Přelouč was an important strategic transit place in the 13th and 14th centuries. During the Hussite Wars, Přelouč was conquered and badly damaged. As a result, its importance declined and it became a small agricultural market town. In 1518, it was joined to the Pardubice estate. New economical and cultural development occurred in the second half of the 16th century and in 1580, it was promoted to a town by Rudolf II. The War of the Austrian Succession again damaged the town, which again became a small agricultural town. It was not until the first half of the 19th century, thanks to the construction of a new imperial road and then the railway, that Přelouč became the second most economically important town in the region. From 1850 to 1960, Přelouč was a district town. The largest employer is the industrial company Kiekert-CS. The production plant of the multinational company was founded in Přelouč in 1993 and focuses on the production of closure systems for the automotive industry.
