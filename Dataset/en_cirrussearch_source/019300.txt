Futbola klubs Auda is a Latvian football club, playing in the highest division of Latvian football (Latvian Higher League). They are based in Ķekava, near the capital, Riga. Auda won their first ever major trophy in 2022, beating RFS 1–0 in the final of the Latvian Cup. The history of Auda started in 1969 when the football team of the kolhoz 9. maijs first appeared in the lower divisions of the Latvian championships. This team played its matches in Vecmīlgrāvis in Alberts Šeibelis Stadium, named after the former Latvia national football team captain Alberts Šeibelis. The club played in the lower divisions of Latvian football, its only seasons in the top league came in 1986–1987 but those also didn't bring good results. In the late 1980s the name of the kolhoz and the football team was changed to Auda. In 1991, under the management of Valerijs Leitāns and Juris Docenko, Auda made its debut in the top division of the Latvian championships, the Virslīga. In a competition among 20 teams, Auda finished 15th. The following season, the team RFK was reformed on the basis of the Auda squad. Under this name the team, including many young players, participated in 1. līga (the second division of Latvian football). But results which would correspond to the name of RFK didn't come so in 1995 the team reverted to its former name of Auda. The following three years it played in the third division, the 2. līga. In 1996 Auda was a completely new team which played in the 2nd division. In 1997 the young Auda players won their third division zone, but in the finals in two games lost to the FK Valmiera reserve team. After several years in this league Auda finished first in 2001 and were promoted to the Virslīga. After playing three seasons, in 2004 Auda was relegated back to the 1st division. On 15 October 2005 Auda played its first game in its new stadium in Ķekava. In 2007 FK Auda and FK Alberts united as FK Auda/Alberts, although the merger was gradually reduced with both teams mostly parting ways later. FK Auda/Alberts, the former FK Auda-2 (farmclub), plays in the 2. līga. The latter club has joined with FK Alberts and uses FK Auda second squad players and FK Alberts players. After a long stint in the First League, Auda achieved promotion once again and returned to the Virslīga in 2022. On 19 October 2022, Auda won their first ever major trophy, beating RFS 1–0 in the final of the Latvian Cup, thanks to a goal from Daniils Ulimbaševs. This also secured them European football for the first time in their history, where they are competing in the following season's Europa Conference League. In the 2023 season under Simo Valakari, Auda finished 3rd place in the league and won the bronze medal, the club's first medal in the top-tier league. Auda also qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Conference League qualifiers. After the season, Valakari departed for Riga FC, with former SC Corinthians Paulista assistant manager Filipe Almeida from Portugal becoming the new head coach.
