Wikimedia chapters are national or sub-national not-for-profit organizations created to promote the interests of Wikimedia projects locally, by members of the movement. Chapters are legally independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, entering into an agreement with the foundation following acceptance by the Affiliations Committee (formerly known as "Chapters Committee"), and have no control over Foundation websites. They organize regional conferences, outreach, and global events such as Wikimania. As of August 2019 there were 40 recognized Wikimedia chapters in 38 countries. A number of chapters have closed down over time. Notable among them is the Russian-language chapter Wikimedia RU, which closed down following pressure by the Russian government. The links go to the articles on Meta Wikimedia (the central wiki for coordinating across projects); extra links will also appear, if they exist, to articles on the English-language and respective language Wikipedias, in that order. Therefore, most of these links will not lead to encyclopedic pages aimed at the typical reader, and might even assume the reader is already a contributor.
