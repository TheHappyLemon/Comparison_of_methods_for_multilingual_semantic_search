Serekunda (proper: Sayerr Kunda or Sere Kunda, sometimes spelled Serrekunda) is the largest urban centre in The Gambia. It is situated close to the Atlantic coast, 13 km (8 mi) south-west of the capital, Banjul, and is formed of nine villages which have grown together into a larger urban area. Serekunda was founded in the second half of the 19th century by Sayerr Jobe, a Wolof man originally from Koki in the Kingdom of Cayor, in what is now northern Senegal. At the time Sukuta was the only nearby settlement, and the area was a thick forest. The name 'Serekunda' is a corruption of 'Sayerr Kunda', meaning 'the home of Sayerr's family'.
