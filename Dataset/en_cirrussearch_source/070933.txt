Mnet (acronym of Music Network) is a South Korean pay television music channel owned by CJ E&M, a division of CJ ENM, part of CJ Group. The CJ E&M Center Studio located in Sangam-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul is the headquarters, broadcast and recording centre of many Mnet programs with a studio audience, namely the live weekly music show M Countdown. It is also the venue for live performances in survival shows such as Superstar K, Show Me The Money series, Produce 101 series, Comeback War series, Planet series and Street Dance series. Other shows are filmed in CJ E&M Studio in Ilsan and CJ E&M Contents World in Paju. The global website named for Mnet Global changed to MWave in April 2013. Other sites from Mnet are not affected with the change. On 5 February 2020, it was revealed that CJ ENM had begun restructuring Mnet's "We Are K-Pop" slogan and brand after the controversy behind "Produce 101" damaged the network's image. On 24 February 2020, Mnet unveiled their new brand logo along with its 25th anniversary., Their new logo design is based on their old logo from 1995 with the addition of their current Mnet shape and colour. M2, Mwave, and the Mnet Production logo have stuck to the former design.[citation needed] On 21 May 2020, Mnet reverted its logo back to its former design with Social distancing animations.[citation needed] Mnet Digital Studio launched STUDIO CHOOM in May 2019, a YouTube channel which features notable Kpop acts performing dances in front of the studio's white background and colored lights. The sets often feature backup dancers and usually lack any background props.
