Jebel Barkal Meroë Dungonab Bay Sanganeb The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Sudan accepted the convention on 6 June 1974. There are three World Heritage Sites in Sudan, with a further 15 on the tentative list. The first site in Sudan was listed in 2003, this was Jebel Barkal and the associated sites. The sites of Meroë were listed in 2011 and Sanganeb Marine National Park and Dungonab Bay – Mukkawar Island Marine National Park in 2016. The latter is a natural site while the first two are listed for their cultural significance. Sudan has served one term on the World Heritage Committee. UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural. In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Sudan maintains 15 properties on its tentative list.
