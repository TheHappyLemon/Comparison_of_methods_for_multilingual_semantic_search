According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 539,671 people. Calamba is the regional center of the Calabarzon region. It is situated 50 kilometers (31 mi) south of Manila and 37 kilometers (23 mi) west of Santa Cruz. The city is known as the "Spring Resort Capital of the Philippines" because of its numerous hot spring resorts, which are mostly located in Barangays Pansol, Bucal, Bagong Kalsada, and Lingga. According to the 2020 census, Calamba has a population of 539,671 people, making it the most populous local government unit in Laguna. It is the fifth-densest city in the province with more than 2,600 people per square kilometer after San Pedro, Biñan, Cabuyao, and Santa Rosa. Based on the overall rankings of the 2014 Cities and Municipalities Index, the city ranked 18th in the overall competitiveness (cities ranking) and first among cities in the Calabarzon region. Calamba is known to be Calabarzon's richest city because of its numerous industries. Calamba is the hometown of the de facto Philippine national hero, José Rizal. The name of the city is derived from Tagalog kalamba, meaning a wide-mouthed earthen water jar (also called balanga or banga). The origin of the name is reflected in the Calamba Jar landmark in city plaza, as well as the city's seal which depicts a water jar superimposed with a profile of José Rizal. The oldest part of Calamba is believed to be Barangay Sucol where its first settlers remained. With the arrival of Spaniards, the whole area was converted into a hacienda, then a part of Tabuco (present-day Cabuyao). In 1639 Calamba was the site of a rebellion of Chinese farmers, who had been forcibly resettled there by Governor Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera. This rebellion spread north of the Pasig River and eventually culminated in the deaths of over 20,000 Chinese in the whole region surrounding Manila. Calamba became an independent pueblo on August 28, 1742, and formed into the town of Calamba in 1770. In 1813, Calamba was placed in the hands of "encargados" by the Dominican Brothers, who divided it into portions and sold the haciendas to the natives during the American regime. During the Japanese occupation in World War II, Calamba was the location of a massacre committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, in which at least 2,000 civilians were killed. The St. John the Baptist Church, established in 1859, was burned by the Japanese during World War II. It was reconstructed by Fr. Eliseo Dimaculangan. It was the christening site of José Rizal. The original baptismal font has been preserved and refurbished.[citation needed] After a process of more than seven years, Calamba became the second component city of the Laguna by virtue of Republic Act No. 9024, "An Act Converting the Municipality of Calamba, Province of Laguna into a Component City to be known as the City of Calamba." R.A. 9024 was signed into law by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on March 5, 2001, at the Malacañan Palace. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) then set the plebiscite for Calamba's cityhood on April 21, 2001, where 15,056 residents participated. 3,413 or 22.67% voted "No" while the remaining 77.33% voted "Yes" to Calamba's conversion into a component city. As early as 1994, the town's Sangguniang Bayan approved Resolution No. 60, Series of 1994 requesting the Senate of the Philippines through its president and the House of Representatives through its speaker to co-sponsor a bill for Calamba's conversion into a city. It was only after two years that another resolution, Resolution No. 115 was passed requesting then Congressman Joaquin M. Chipeco Jr, to co-sponsor a bill for Calamba's cityhood and requesting the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for their comments and recommendations regarding the matter. Another two years passed before House Bill No. 986 and Senate bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 were filed in the House of Representatives by Congressman Chipeco and Senate of the Philippines by Senators Franklin M. Drilon and Sergio Osmeña III, respectively. It was only in the year 2000 that the motion for Calamba's cityhood was fast-tracked. Then Mayor Severino J. Lajara requested favorable endorsement of House Bill No. 986 from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan on January 3, 2000. The Sangguniang Bayan also endorsed House Bill No. 986 and Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and also requested favorable endorsement from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan in the same month. A month passed and Mayor Lajara sent a follow-up letter to then Vice Governor Teresita "Ningning" Lazaro on updates regarding the matter. On March 8, the House Committee on Local Government approved House Bill No. 986 on 2nd reading at a hearing held at Hotel Rembrandt, Quezon City. The same House Committee conducted a public hearing on House Bill No. 986 at the Calamba Elementary School (Central II) gymnasium on March 23, approving the House Bill in principle. House Bill 986 was deliberated in April by the House of Representatives in plenary session and approved as House Bill No. 10661, which was then filed with the Senate of the Philippines in June. The year 2001 came and brought about approval on 2nd reading of Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and House Bill No. 10661 in a hearing held on February 5 at the Ambrocio Padilla Hall, Senate of the Philippines.

Rizal (2022–present) The seal of the City of Calamba has evolved and has been modified throughout the years.

In a citywide seal-making contest, Reyjon de Guzman emerged as winner, for his work best symbolized the ideals, pride and achievements of the city. Each color, shape, number and object has its own meaning relative to what is Calamba in the past, present and future. Shield shape – The shield shape in the center, with a slight circular bottom, flat top and curved edges at the top corners project solidity and congruence. Banga shaped twined with Dr. Jose Rizal's image – The historical ambience is depicted in this twin image.

Numbers – the engraved "1742" mentions the year when Calamba was founded and seceded from the town of Cabuyao, while "2001" was identified as the year of Calamba's cityhood. Objects – the mountain in the background and the water current at the bottom part relate to land and water resources of the city pertain to the vast natural resources of Mount Makiling and the aquatic benefits of Laguna de Bay. The water beneath Mt. Makiling shows that Calamba touches a body of water notably Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the country, and that's why Calamba is also known as the "City by the Lake".

Metallic gold – This represents the radiating image of Dr. Jose Rizal and Banga that reflects in the minds and deeds of Calambeños. Red – This symbolizes the burning patriotism of residents as exemplified by Rizal. Blue – As land and water represent wealth and prosperity, the color blue signifies productivity and tranquility of the constituents. Silver grey – This represents the transformation of development from an agricultural pueblo in the 1700s to an agro-industrial town in the 1900s and finally to an industrial city. White – This projects purity, transparency, efficiency and prudence pertaining to governance. Calamba has a golden edge etched at the upper half with the words Lungsod ng Calamba depicting Calamba as a Philippine component city. Laguna at the bottom part means that Calamba is still part of Laguna province.

The Buhayani Festival, the official festival of the City of Calamba was the brainchild of Mayor Justin Marc SB. Chipeco during his first year as Mayor in 2013. Mayor Timmy wanted the city to have a festival that will best characterize its culture, progress and tourism potential. He wanted to capitalize on the city's historical heritage as the birthplace of unofficial Philippine National Hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Thus, the Buhayani Festival was born. The term "Buhayani" was coined by joining two Filipino words, "buhay" meaning life or the state of being alive and lively and "bayani" or hero. The festival's tagline "Buhay ng Bayani, Buháy na Bayani" literally translates to "Life of the Hero"pertaining to the life of our famous kababayan, Dr. Jose Rizal and "Living Hero"which refers to the common man who has the capacity and potential to become everyday heroes in their own small ways. "We want everyone who revere our kababayan, Dr. Jose Rizal to come to Calamba and join us in honouring him on his birthday and in celebrating the modern Rizal in us. We want to make our National Hero modern and relevant in today's challenging times and we want to celebrate the spirit of heroism that lives in each Filipino, not just in us Calambeños," Mayor Chipeco was quoted saying. Different activities were lined up for this year's Buhayani Festival: Kuwentong Bayani for selected Grade 5 students, Talinong Rizal Quiz Bee, Buhayani Football Cup, Independence Day Job Fair, SayawIndak Street Dancing Competition, Marching Band Competition, Baile de Gala, Hawig Rizal (Rizal Look-a-Like), Buhayani Eye Care Mission, and a whole lot more. Highlighting this year's celebration is the Morning Program wherein Philippine National Police Chief, Director General Ronald "Bato" Dela Rosa is the Guest of Honor and Speaker. A special wreath-laying ceremony shall also commence at the Museo ni Rizal sa Calamba after a simultaneous floral offering at five different Rizal monuments around the city. "Jose Rizal is not just the pride of Calamba, he is the pride of the entire country as he was the Greatest Malay to have lived. His works, teachings and ideals have inspired and will continue to inspire us as we strive to live up to his ideals of nationalism and love of country. In the Buhayani Festival, we celebrate an ideal and an advocacy that through this festival, we can rekindle the fire of patriotism and heroism in the hearts of every Filipino. Come to Calamba – retrace history's footsteps, rediscover the richness and uniqueness of our heritage, fire up our Filipino pride and be inspired to share and spread what you have experienced and be part of the force that will bring about a renewed love of country in every Filipino," Mayor Chipeco challenged.
