The Art Museum of Estonia (Estonian: Eesti Kunstimuuseum) was established in 1919. Originally based in Kadriorg Palace, the museum has expanded across several sites and today exhibits both international and local art works. At the end of the 1970s, in the 1980s the first branches of the Art Museum of Estonia were founded. Starting in 1995, all of the branches offer different educational programmes for children and young people. In 1996 the exhibition hall on the first floor of Rotermann Salt Storage was opened; this branch was closed in May 2005. Art Museum of Estonia consists of the following branches: In the Kadriorg park area: Kumu Art Museum (main building of the Estonian Art Museum) - it displays Estonian art from the 18th century until now.
