It is the follow-up to their multi-platinum selling Dark Horse in 2008. On September 26, the band officially released two singles, "When We Stand Together" and "Bottoms Up". Both songs were made available for download on September 27, 2011. The first track of the record, "This Means War", was released on November 10, 2011 as the third single. The album's cover features Vancouver's Gastown Steam Clock. The clock is set at 11:21, the date the album was released. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 after selling approximately 227,000 copies in its first week, just 0.18% below the number one spot, Michael Bublé's Christmas. Nickelback toured in support of the album on their Here and Now Tour. As of October 2013, the album has sold two million copies worldwide. According to Metacritic, the album has received an average review score of 51/100, based on 9 reviews, indicating "mixed reviews". Consequence of Sound awarded the album two stars, out of a possible 5, stating that "Here and Now might prove to be a step above the last effort, but likewise a step high enough to hang its creators on a barn rafter." Conversely, Canadian music and entertainment website Rockstar Weekly called it "far and away, the best Canadian album of 2011." The album has topped both the HMV Canada CD sales chart and the US iTunes Album chart in its first week of sales. The album debuted at number 10 in the UK charts. On December 16, 2011, the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 100,000 copies in the UK.
