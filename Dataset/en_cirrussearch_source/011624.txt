The Hécate II is the standard heavy sniper rifle and anti-materiel rifle of the French Army, sometimes known as the FR-12.7 (French: Fusil à Répétition de calibre 12.7 mm or "12.7 mm calibre repeating rifle"). It is manufactured by PGM Précision of France. This is the largest weapon manufactured by PGM, chambered for the .50 BMG (12.7×99mm NATO) cartridge. The name of the rifle is derived from the ancient Greek goddess Hecate. Its design is the same metallic-skeleton as used in other similar rifles in the PGM family, only scaled up. The barrel of the Hécate is manufactured by FN Herstal and is lined with Stellite alloy which is also used for large calibre machine guns. This increases the barrel's longevity. It is fitted with a high-efficiency muzzle brake which reduces the felt recoil to about the level expected of a 7.62×51mm NATO-chambered rifle. The rifle is equipped with both an adjustable front bipod and a rear monopod for maximum accuracy. The stock is also adjustable. The Hecate II was a heavy firearm and weighs up to 35.27 pounds at most. The standard-issue sight used with the Hécate II is the SCROME LTE J10 F1 10× telescope.[citation needed]  Brazil Marine Corps Special Operations Battalion  Bulgaria - SOBT and SKSO  Egypt – Used By Rapid Deployment Forces and Black Cobra  Estonia  France  Indonesia  Israel  Latvia  Lithuania[citation needed]  Poland  Saudi Arabia[citation needed]  Slovenia   Switzerland Snipers of the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment section de tireurs d'élite (Sniper) France deploying a PGM Hécate II and FR F2 in Afghanistan The distinctive muzzle brake on the PGM Hécate II A PGM Hécate II with its standard issue scope in the French military, the Scrome LTE J10 F1 FR F2 PGM 338 PGM Ultima Ratio Neville, Leigh (2016-08-25).
