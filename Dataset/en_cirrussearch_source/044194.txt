Bolivia made its debut appearances at the eleventh edition of the Summer Olympic Games (1936) and the seventh edition of the Winter Olympic Games (1956), both under the auspices of the Bolivian Olympic Committee almost since its inception in 1932, and acceptance by the International Olympic Committee in 1936. Regular participation at the Summer Games followed at the sixteenth edition (1964) except at the twenty-second edition during the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. Bolivia has yet to win an Olympic medal, a distinction shared with no other South American nation. Their best result at team event placing was in Athletics at the twenty-fifth edition of the Summer Olympics (1992). The women’s 4x400m relay team finished fourteenth out of fifteen teams. The best result of individual event placing was in Athletics at the thirty-first edition of the Summer Olympics (2016). In the Women’s 20km Walk, Ángela Castro finished at eighteenth place out of seventy-four athletes.
