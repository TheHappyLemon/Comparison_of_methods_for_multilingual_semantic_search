In January 2014 Gabovs went on trial with the English Football League Championship club Blackpool, but due to managerial change at the time he was refused a place in the team. After the retirement of midfielder Juris Laizāns, Gabovs was elected as Skonto Rīga new captain for the upcoming season. Under his captaincy the club reached the Latvian Cup final, losing to FK Jelgava in penalties. Disregarding Skonto's immense financial problems, long-term debts, unpaid wages and sanctions from the Latvian Football Federation the club finished the 2014 season with Gabovs playing a substantial role in the right-back position.
