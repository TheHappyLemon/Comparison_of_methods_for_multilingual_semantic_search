Valaste Falls (Estonian: Valaste juga) is the highest waterfall in Estonia and neighboring regions (30.5 meters or 100 feet). It is located between Ontika and Valaste in Toila Parish of Ida-Viru County and is formed by Valaste Creek (Estonian: Valaste oja) as it flows over the Baltic Klint not far from the shore of the Gulf of Finland. It is a popular tourist attraction, with its spray freezing up in winter. The site has a parking lot, some explanatory signs, and a trail using a double spiral staircase to reach the bottom of the cliff. Opposite the waterfall, a viewing platform has been built, and this offers views of the falls. The platform was taken out of service and the stairs to it were closed in 2013.[citation needed] A new staircase with platforms and walkways to the shore of the Gulf of Finland was built and opened to the public in 2018.[citation needed] In winter Valaste Falls in winter Broken Platform "North Estonian Klint Regional Site".
