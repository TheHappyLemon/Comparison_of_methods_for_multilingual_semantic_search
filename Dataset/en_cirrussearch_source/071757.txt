In association football, at least 45 players have played at least 1,000 official matches at all age levels. Regarding youth football, only matches with national teams are counted, as such data for club levels cannot be found for the majority of the players. Regarding B teams and reserve teams, appearances for such teams are only included if made in the primary football pyramid and not in reserve divisions. English goalkeeper Peter Shilton holds the record for the most appearances, making over 1,400 appearances between the 1960s and 1990s, including a national record of 125 appearances for England, and in 1996 became the first footballer to make 1,000 league appearances. In March 2022, Robert Carmona from Uruguay was recognized as the oldest active footballer by Guinness World Records and was reported as having played around 2,200 official matches, a total that would place him at the top of the list by far; however, due to a lack of details about the distribution of these matches per year and team, or even which teams he played for, he cannot currently be added to the list. As of 23:15, 31 March 2024 (UTC) Bold indicates the player is currently active. "Span" refers to the years of the player's first and last official matches. It is unrelated to the career span mentioned in his bio's infobox or article. For example, if his last match was in 2018, but he officially retired in 2020 after being an unused substitute for 2 years, his "Span" value would end in 2018. Similarly, if a player joined his first team in 1992, but debuted in official matches in 1993, his "Span" value would begin in 1993. The teams in which the player made no official appearance are omitted, e.g. Everton for Pat Jennings or Scarborough for Paul Bastock, while teams in which it is known the player to have made appearances for, but these are unaccounted for, and teams in which it isn't known whether he made any appearance or not are included with a question mark in place of the actual unknown number of appearances. Peter Shilton played in 6 official matches for England Schoolboys. Peter Shilton additionally played 4 matches for the Football League XI, which raise up the total of first-class senior matches from 1,396 to 1,400 if included. RSSSF includes the aforementioned matches as official in the count of official first-class senior matches, but matches against League selections are also often seen as unofficial friendlies, even if they are played on slots during the FIFA calendar, and they also include 4 other matches for England, additionally to the 125, which, being against clubs, are considered unofficial from the other relative sources. Fábio made at least 9 appearances for Brazil U20: four appearances in 1998 and five appearances in 1999, and may have matches unaccounted for Brazil U20 in the 1998 Toulon Tournament. Fábio made 13 appearances for Brazil U17: seven appearances in the 1997 South American U-17 Championship and six appearances in the 1997 FIFA U-17 World Championship. Fábio, based on oGol, may have possibly played in 4 more matches for Cruzeiro between 1999 and 2000, which, aligned with his FootballDatabase profile, where his team appears to be Cruzeiro B, could be attributed to Cruzeiro B, but in lack of additional sources to support this and because these aren't included in the source of Cruzeiro, they can't be included, even though the site of Cruzeiro could well be referring only to his numbers with the A team. oGol additionally includes wrongly 1 match where he hadn't played; this has been verified by all other available relative sources. In addition, 2 matches played in 2016 for Primeira Liga, which Cruzeiropedia anymore includes as friendlies, as they aren't recognized by the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), they are also included here for two reasons: i) even though they weren't recognized as official by CBF, since they weren't played under their seal, these matches were played under rules and regulations of official matches, e.g. with referees of an according level, in an according condition of field, according number of substitutes' limit, et c., ii) the football databases (oGol, SoccerWay, et c.), which include official club matches, include these matches. Paul Bastock is ofen credited with 1,280 club appearances in the news instead of 1,286 because he is credited with 677 appearances for Boston United instead of 679, most likely the total count is missing his match for Cheltenham Town, his match for Pinchbeck United and his match for Deeping Rangers in 2022, and there is some other miscalculation that can't be traced since all sources listing him with a total of 1,280 matches lack the detailed stats per club. Paul Bastock additionally played once for England C, though this match is against a League selection, and such matches are also often seen as unofficial friendlies, even if they are played on slots during the FIFA calendar. Rogério Ceni has scored 129 goals in official matches in his career, with the source having 131 goals as a total instead of 129, as it includes 2 goals in friendly matches (the "Torneio Constantino Cury" was a friendly tournament). František Plánička additionally played in at least 66 matches for selects (Prague, international veterans and other selects), which could raise the total to 1,253+ matches, but such matches are also often seen as unofficial ones, therefore they are not included in the list. František Plánička is credited with 1442 matches by Slavia Praha's official website, but this claim isn't in agreement with the majority of the other sources, which give a total of 1,235 matches, or 1,253 matches, which could well be a typo, but in details the total appears to be 1,253, of which 1,253 matches only 1,187 are listed here, as the other are matches for veterans and selects, which are also often seen as unofficial ones. František Plánička appeared overall (including friendlies) in more than 1,100 matches for Slavia Praha. František Plánička's tally with the national team is unclear, and it could well have been even 74 or 76, based on many other sources. Tommy Hutchison played for Bulova 22 times in league matches, and in at least four matches in cups, as he may have other matches unaccounted for in the Hong Kong FA Cup, in the Viceroy Cup or in the Hong Kong Senior Challenge Shield. Tommy Hutchinson played in at least eight matches for Swansea City in the Welsh Cup, as he may have other matches unaccounted for in the Welsh Cup, and the Welsh competitions in general, e.g. like the West Wales FA Senior Cup. Tommy Hutchison made 76 appearances for Merthyr Tydfil scoring on two occasions, with the source from Merthyr Tydfil's site (with the club now – 23 November 2021 – called Merthyr Town) having his last name misspelled, but it's crystal clear this is about him for three reasons: i) from their description of the player, ii) there is a long history of his surname being misspelled on many occasions in the past, and iii) it can be verified from other matches where he is credited as "Hutchinson", if the lineups of these matches (which were for Swansea City in the FA Challenge Cup) are aligned with the lineups of them in his profile in ENFA (English National Football Association), with 73 of these 76 matches being in the league and so 3 in cups, with the two of these three being able to be traced with the misspelled surname from the same site that had these two matches of Tommy Hutchison for Swansea City, where he is listed as "Tommy Hutchinson", and are 2 matches against Colchester United for the FA Trophy in 1992, and the one left was a match in South Wales Senior Cup on 8 February 1994 against Taffs Well. Yasuhito Endō's previous references from official websites of some of the clubs he played and from football statistics databases are missing 3 official matches he played in the 2006 A3 Champions Cup for Gamba Osaka, where he scored once.

Xavi's previous references from official websites of some of the clubs he played and from football statistics databases are missing 2 official matches he played for Al Sadd in cups in Qatar, one in 2016 for the Emir Cup and one for the Qatar Cup in 2018. Xavi additionally played 12 matches for the unofficial "national" team of Catalonia, and also scored goals on two occasions.

Ray Clemence additionally played 3 matches for the Football League XI in the "Inter League" competition, which are considered as official by RSSSF and often regarded as official, but matches against or with League selections are also often seen as unofficial friendlies, even if they are played on slots during the FIFA calendar. Javier Zanetti played 13 times for Argentina U23; 1 match at the 1995 Copa Mercosur, 6 matches at the 1995 Panamerican Games, and 6 matches at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Javier Zanetti additionally played one match for Argentina against a World XI selection in 2001, in a testimonial (farewell to playing football) match about Diego Maradona. Javier Zanetti, based on oGol, has played in 861 matches for Inter Milan, instead of 858, but that source wrongly includes 3 matches more, in which Cristiano Zanetti played instead of Javier Zanetti (this has been checked and confirmed by other several football statistics databases available on the web, videos, newspapers, specifically from the reports of these matches in la Repubblica and in Inter-related websites). Lionel Messi made five appearances for Argentina U23 and scored two goals in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Lionel Messi made 18 appearances for Argentina U20 and scored 14 times in them: two appearances and three goals in official friendlies in 2004, nine appearances and five goals in the 2005 South American U-20 Championship, seven appearances and six goals in the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship.

Robbie James' appearances for Merthyr Tydfil and Llanelli are league matches only. Robbie James' appearances for Wales at junior level are unaccounted for. Robbie James made 68 appearances for Cardiff City and scored three times in them, based on bibliography placed within the section of the references. Though based in Monaco, AS Monaco FC plays in the French football league system and in European, intercontinental and world tournaments appears with the flag of France. João Moutinho has been also credited with 221 matches for Monaco, but this is a mistake as SoccerWay also includes two matches he played in the 2014 Emirates Cup, which was a friendly tournament. João Moutinho, based on BeSoccer, may have possibly played in six more matches for Portugal U21, but, in lack of other sources to support more matches for Portugal U21, these possibly extra matches are not included in the list, even though he may have played in more friendly matches for Portugal U21.

Andrés Iniesta additionally played for the unofficial "national" team of Catalonia.
