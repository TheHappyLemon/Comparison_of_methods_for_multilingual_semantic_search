He won his first league title the following season – "At 16, people were calling me 'the new Lewandowski', and that was tough to handle, but I changed my attitude, grew up and am now much better at not taking to heart what people say. Of course, I still have big dreams". On 11 July 2017, Kownacki signed a five-year contract with Italian side Sampdoria.
