Aldo Sebastián Corzo Chávez (born 20 May 1989) is a Peruvian professional footballer who plays as right-back for Peruvian Liga 1 club Universitario de Deportes and the Peru national team. Corzo arrived to Alianza Lima after playing in the youth ranks of Club de Regatas Lima when Jaime Duarte, a former Alianza player, saw him. He was promoted to the first team in 2008 by Richard Páez. In August 2008, he made his official debut in a 2–0 victory against Sport Boys in Matute, playing the entire game and doing an outstanding performance. After that match, Corzo became a regular in the starting XI, later a key player, and contributed to save Alianza from relegation to the second division. The following year, he played the 2009 Torneo Descentralizado finals, ultimately losing against Universitario de Deportes. On 7 January 2010, Corzo signed a two years contract for Universidad San Martín de Porres, with which he won the 2010 Torneo Descentralizado, as well as playing the 2010 Copa Sudamericana, the 2011 Copa Libertadores and the 2012 Copa Sudamericana. He played a total of 153 matches for the club and scored 5 goals. He was part of the Peru U-20 team in the 2009 South American Youth Championship, being eliminated quickly by losing four games. On 2 February 2009, he was called to the senior team by the then current coach Jose 'Chemo' del Solar to play a friendly against El Salvador losing 1–0. In June 2011, the new Peruvian national team coach Sergio Markarian decided to give Corzo a chance to play in a friendly against Senegal. The friendly took place on 28 June 2011 in Lima, and it was the last friendly before the start of the Copa América. Corzo played the entire match against Senegal which finished in a 1–0 victory in favor of Peru. His consistent performances convinced Markarian to include him in Peru's squad for the 2011 Copa América. He made his Copa America debut by starting against Chile in the group stage. Despite the loss, Corzo put in a strong performance at left back by not allowing Chile, with Alexis, to score. His second game in the Copa America was against Venezuela in the third-place match. Corzo again played from the start of the match and gave another solid performance this time at right back. In the end, he helped Peru claim the Bronze medal by winning the match 4–1. This is (coupled with the 2015 Copa América) Peru's best result in the Copa America since they last won Gold in 1975. In May 2018, he was named in Peru’s provisional 24 man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Corzo mainly plays at right back and is naturally right-footed, but he can also play at left back. He is known for his great stamina, his strong willingness to help in the attack, and his aggressive style of defending. He also has good speed and control of the ball.
