He has previously played for the St. John's IceCaps and the Laval Rocket of the American Hockey League. During his youth, Eisenschmid played for the youth team of the ESV Kaufbeuren. For the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, he played in the Deutsche Nachwuchsliga (DNL). At the same time, he was named to the junior team of the national team. In the 2012–13 season, Eisenschmid completed his first game for the first team in the former 2nd Bundesliga. In April 2013, Eisenschmid was signed by the Hamburg Freezers, but he never played for them. Before the 2013–14 season, North America scouts became aware of Eisenschmid. He was selected by the Medicine Hat Tigers of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in the CHL Import Draft in the first round in 28th overall. Due to a clause in his contract, he was able to switch to the Tigers, whom he played with for two seasons. After two successful seasons in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL), he was invited by the Montreal Canadiens summer training camp due to his good performance. He was then offered an AHL contract with the St. John's IceCaps, for whom he was active from October 2015. In January 2017, the Canadiens signed him to a two-year contract, after which he played the 2017–18 season for their new farm team, the Laval Rocket. In June 2018, he signed a contract with the Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), returning to his homeland. Following five seasons with Adler Mannheim, Eisenschmid continued his career in the DEL, signing a one-year contract with EHC München on 4 May 2023. Eisenschmid has represented Germany since his first nomination to the U16 national team of the DEB-Pokal. He also took part in the World Junior Championships for Germany. Eisenschmid debuted for the German senior national team at the end of April 2018 for the 2018 Euro Hockey Challenge and then took part in the 2018 World Championship in Denmark. Eisenschmid has two sisters who also play hockey. His older sister, Tanja, and his younger sister, Nicola played for the German women's national team. His older brother Michael plays ball hockey.
