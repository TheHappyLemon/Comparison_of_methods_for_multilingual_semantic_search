Zabbix is an open-source software tool to monitor IT infrastructure such as networks, servers, virtual machines, and cloud services. Zabbix collects and displays basic metrics. Zabbix is designed primarily as an IT infrastructure monitoring tool. New features are generally released every six months to major versions and every 1.5 years to LTS versions. Released under the terms of GNU General Public License version 2, Zabbix is free software that does not require an additional license to use any of its features. Even though Zabbix is open-source software, it is a closed development software product, developed by Zabbix LLC based in Riga, Latvia. Early in its history, Zabbix was described as simple to set up compared to other monitoring solutions. However, later it was considered by some to need a significant amount of manual configuration. As an open-source product however Zabbix focuses on the usage of existing tools and functionality as well as proprietary solutions to achieve a scalable monitoring solution. The first stable version, 1.0, was released in 2004. Since the first stable version was released as 1.0, Zabbix versioning has used minor version numbers to denote major releases. Each minor release implements many new features, while change level releases mostly introduce bugfixes. Zabbix version numbering scheme has changed over time. While the first two stable branches were 1.0 and 1.1, after 1.1 it was decided to use odd numbers for development versions and even numbers for stable versions. As a result, 1.3 followed 1.1 as a development update to be released as 1.4.[citation needed] Free and open-source software portal Comparison of network monitoring systems List of systems management systems "Release Notes for Zabbix 6.4.12".

Although Zabbix is a feature rich and flexible monitoring solution, we like the fact that it is fairly simple and straightforward to set up, compared to other monitoring solutions such as Nagios due to its template design for items, triggers and graphs. McKendrick, Russ (2015-12-15). Monitoring Docker. Packt Publishing Ltd. ISBN 978-1-78588-550-1. Out of the these three options, Zabbix seemed to be the most straightforward one at the time. It was doing enough work to manage the several hundred servers I was going to monitor without having to have the extra work of learning the complexities of setting up Nagios or Zenoss; after all, given the task the software had, I needed to be able to trust that I had set it up correctly. In this chapter, while I am going to go into some detail about the setup and the basics of using Zabbix, we will only be touching on some of the functionalities, which can do a lot more than just monitor your containers.
