On August 3, 2015, he signed with the Heat after averaging 11.8 points and 2.8 rebounds in 10 summer league games. He failed to appear in the Heat's first four games of the season before making his NBA debut on November 5 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, playing in just under seven minutes of action. On November 12, in just his third NBA game, Richardson started at shooting guard in place of the absent Dwyane Wade. He subsequently recorded eight points and three rebounds in 20 minutes of action, as the Heat defeated the Utah Jazz 92–91.

On March 11, he scored a career-high 22 points in a 118–96 win over the Chicago Bulls. On April 5, he was named Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for March, becoming just the third player in Heat franchise history to win the monthly rookie award; the other two being Caron Butler (four-time recipient in 2002–03) and Michael Beasley (April 2009). In July 2016, Richardson re-joined the Heat for the 2016 NBA Summer League.
