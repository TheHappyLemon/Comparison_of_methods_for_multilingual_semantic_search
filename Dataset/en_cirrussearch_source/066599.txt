The coat of arms of Cyprus may refer to the national symbol used in the Republic of Cyprus. The coat of arms of the Republic of Cyprus depicts a dove carrying an olive branch, symbolizing peace, over "1960", the year of Cypriot independence from British rule. The background is a copper-yellow colour; this symbolises the large deposits of copper ore on Cyprus (chiefly in the form of chalcopyrite, which is yellow in colour). The two-part wreath represents the two ethnic groups of Cyprus, Greeks and Turks. The Cypriot coat of arms was selected as the main motif of a high value collectors' coin in 2008, the Cyprus introduction to the Eurozone commemorative coin, minted in 2008. The obverse depicts the coat of arms of Cyprus while the reverse depicts Cyprus connected with a ring to Europe, on a transfigured map.

In March 2007, a slight change to the layout of the arms was made. The dove is in a different attitude.
