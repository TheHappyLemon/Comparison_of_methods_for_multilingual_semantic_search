FC Mordovia Saransk (Russian: ФК Мордовия Саранск) was a Russian association football club from Saransk, Republic of Mordovia. In its current state it was formed in 2005, through the merge of Biokhimik-Mordovia and Lisma-Mordovia. The club was founded in 1961. In 2010, the club won promotion to the Russian First Division. On 8 May 2012, Mordovia beat Shinnik Yaroslavl 2–0 at home. This result meant that with a round to spare the team won promotion to the Russian Premier League for the 2012–13 season for the first time in its history. It was relegated back to the second tier after one season, and then returned to the Premier League for the 2014–15 season, taking 8th spot. After the next 2015–16 season, it was once again relegated. At the end of the 2016–17 season they were relegated for the second year in a row, to the third-tier Russian Professional Football League. They returned to the second tier after one season down for 2018–19 season. On 18 June 2020, club director Nikolay Levin confirmed that the club had failed FNL licensing for the 2020–21 season, and it had not been determined which league the club would play in. The club was not admitted to the 2020–21 Russian Professional Football League either, thus losing professional status. 1961: Stroitel Saransk 1962–71: Spartak Saransk 1972–79: Elektrosvet Saransk 1980–02: Svetotekhnika Saransk 2003–04: Lisma-Mordovia Saransk 2005–: Mordovia Saransk (merged with Biokhimik-Mordovia).
