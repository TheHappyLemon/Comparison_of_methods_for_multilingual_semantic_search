The Russian Basketball Super League 1, or Super Liga 1, (Russian: Баскетбольная Cуперлига 1), formerly known as the Russian Basketball Super League A or the Russian Basketball Super Liga A, is a men's professional basketball league that was the pre-eminent league of Russian professional basketball until 2010. Currently, it is the second-tier division of the Russian professional basketball pyramid. The league is run by the Russian Basketball Federation (RBF). After being the first-tier division of Russian basketball, from its first season in 1991–92, the Super League A was relegated to being the second-tier division of Russian basketball after the 2009–10 season, and was replaced with a different first-tier league, starting with the 2010–11 season of the Russian Professional Basketball League (PBL). The successor league to the Super League 1 was not controlled by the Russian Basketball Federation (RBF), like the Super League 1 is, but by a separate body named the Professional Basketball League (PBL). From the 2010–11 season onward, the Super League A and Super League B (the previous second division of the Russian basketball pyramid) divisions were united into a single league that serves as the second tier of Russian basketball, named the Super League 1. The 2010–11 season featured 11 clubs.[citation needed] BC Samara Runa Basket Moscow Temp-SUMZ Revda Irkut Irkutsk Uralmash Yekaterinburg Universitet Yugra Surgut Novosibirsk Barnaul Ufimets Ufa Khimki CSKA Moscow-2 Dome Springs Izhevsk MBA Moscow Lokomotiv Kuban 2 Dynamo Vladivostok 2011 Spartak Primorye 2012 Ural Yekaterinburg 2013 Ural Yekaterinburg 2014 Avtodor Saratov 2015 Novosibirsk 2016 PSK Sakhalin 2017 Universitet Yugra Surgut 2018 BC Spartak Primorye 2019 BC Samara 2020 not awarded 2021 BC Samara 2022 Uralmash Yekaterinburg 2023 Uralmash Yekaterinburg 1995 CSKA Moscow 1996 CSKA Moscow 1997 Avtodor Saratov 1998 Avtodor Saratov 1999 CSKA Moscow 2000 CSKA Moscow 2001 Ural Great Perm 2002 Ural Great Perm 2003 CSKA Moscow 2004 CSKA Moscow 2005 CSKA Moscow 2006 CSKA Moscow 2007 CSKA Moscow 2008 CSKA Moscow 2009 CSKA Moscow 2010 CSKA Moscow 2011 Universitet Yugra Surgut 2012 Ural Yekaterinburg 2013 Universitet Yugra Surgut 2014 Avtodor Saratov 2015 Samara SGEU 2016 PSK Sakhalin 2017 Novosibirsk 2018 BC Samara 2019 Vostok-65 2020 Spartak Primorye Russian Cup Russian Professional Championship USSR Cup USSR Premier League VTB United League PBL 2010-13 Клубы приняли решение о ликвидации баскетбольной Суперлиги (in Russian).
