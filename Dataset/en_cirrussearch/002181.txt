Musiqq represented Latvia in 2011 Eurovision Song Contest Düsseldorf with the song "Angel in Disguise". They are also known as Latvian rap duo called "Bermudu Divstūris", which formed in 2011.

As "Bermudu Divstūris" the band has released three studio albums and in 2014 it received The Golden Microphone award as "Best hip-hop or dance album". Musiqq formed in 2009, when founding member Marats Ogļezņevs left his previous group "Device" and invited Emīls Balceris to a meeting. The singers had previously met by participating in the TV show "Koru kari" ("Choir Wars") in 2008, where Emīls Balceris and Marats Ogļezņevs sang together in Liepājas red choir, led by singer Chilli. In the same year, Marats Ogļezņevs saw Emīls Balceris perform in the youth broadcast "SeMS" and decided to write him a letter with an invitation to meet and work together. At group's first meeting, they wrote four demo versions of songs. Musiqq released their debut album, "Šī ir tikai mūzika"("This is just a music"), on 24 March 2010, which was recorded at MicRec recording company in cooperation with the producer Jānis Kalve. Four singles were released from "Šī ir tikai mūzika"("This is just a music"), including their first single "Klimata kontrole"("Climate control") and "Abrakadabra", which won the main prize of the pop music survey "Musical Bank". Other singles from the album were "Pirmā manā Ziemassvētku sarakstā"("The first on my Christmas list"), which was Christmas themed, and the hit "Dzimšanas diena"("Birthday"), which reached number 3 in "SEB Musical Bank 2010". After the success of "Šī ir tikai mūzika"("This is just a music"), Musiqq returned to the studio to begin work on their second album, "Vēl viena mūzika"("Another music"), continuing to collaborate with the producer Jānis Kalve.
