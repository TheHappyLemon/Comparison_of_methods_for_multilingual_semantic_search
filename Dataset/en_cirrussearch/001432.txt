Andrea Burke, née Henkel (born 10 December 1977) is a retired German professional biathlete and the younger sister of Manuela Henkel, a successful cross-country skier. She trained at SV Großbreitenbach. Andrea Henkel started out as a cross-country skier but later specialised in biathlon when women's biathlon became an Olympic sport. Since the 1998/99 season, she was a regular member of the German team in the Biathlon World Cup. After several top-ten results, she could win her first World Cup event in 1999, her second year. She was most successful in the 2006/07 season, which she finished first in the overall standings. Henkel has won four Olympic medals: one gold medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics in the 15 km individual, and a gold (2002), silver (2006) and bronze (2010) medal in relay competitions. She is also the first biathlete to become world champion in each individual event: 2005 in the 15 km individual, 2007 in the 12.5 km mass start, and 2008 in the 7.5 km sprint and subsequent 10 km pursuit. She has won a total of eight gold, six silver and two bronze medals at world championships. She retired from the sport at the end of the 2013/14 season.
