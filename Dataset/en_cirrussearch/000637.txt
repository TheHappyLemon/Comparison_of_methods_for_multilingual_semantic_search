Under the current Constitution of Cameroon, the Prime Minister of Cameroon is a relatively powerless position. While the Prime Minister is officially appointed to be the head of government, the President retains most of the executive power and can fire the Prime Minister at will. The current prime minister, Joseph Ngute, was appointed by president Paul Biya. He took the office on 4 January 2019. The position has existed in the eastern part of Cameroon since it gained its independence from France in 1960. When the western part gained independence from the British in 1961, the two halves of the Cameroon federation maintained their autonomy and each had a separate Prime Minister. In 1972, Cameroon became a unitary state and the position of Prime Minister was temporarily unfilled. In 1975, Paul Biya was appointed as Prime Minister for all of Cameroon. After Biya's succession to the Presidency, the post of Prime Minister did not exist from 1984 to 1991.
