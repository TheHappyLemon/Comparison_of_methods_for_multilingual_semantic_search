.hm is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) of the Heard and McDonald Islands, uninhabited islands in the southern Indian Ocean under the sovereign control of Australia. Although .hm gets a small amount of use, Australia uses the .aq domain (for Antarctica) for its sites related to the islands themselves. As a result, no .hm website is related to the location. The .hm registry was added in July 1997. Registration services are provided by the HM Domain Registry via registry.hm. Domain registration is directly at the second level, and is managed by the HM Domain Registry. Any entity can register an .hm domain.
