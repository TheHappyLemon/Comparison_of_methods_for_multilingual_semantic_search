.id is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Indonesia. Since 2007, it is managed by the Indonesian Internet Domain Name Administrator (Pengelola Nama Domain Internet Indonesia or PANDI), based on regulation set by Decree of Minister of Communication and Information Technology. On 11 March 2013, PANDI approved the adoption of a new desa second level domain for Indonesia's 72,944 villages with autonomy for local affairs. As of 17 August 2014, second-level domain registrations have entered general availability, allowing registrations to be made directly under .id, without a prefix. This brings the total of available extensions to 13: .id—General use ac.id—Academic institutions biz.id—Small and medium commercial entities co.id—Commercial entities desa.id—Villages go.id—Government and governmental system(s) mil.id—Military my.id—Personal/Blogs net.id—Communication/ISP companies or.id—Formal organizations/Community sch.id—Schools web.id—Informal organizations/Personal ponpes.id—Islamic Boarding Schools "Laporan Statistik".
