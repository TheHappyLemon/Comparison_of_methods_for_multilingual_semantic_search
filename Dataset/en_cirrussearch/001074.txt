The Big Christopher (Latvian: Lielais Kristaps) is the highest award given in Latvian cinema. Established in 1977, it is given out at the Latvian National Film Festival. Due to different reasons, the festival has not been held in 1992, 1994 to 1995, 1997 and 1999, and was held biannually from 2001 to 2009, with no festival being held in 2010, 2011 and 2013. Since 2014, it was held again every year. "Lielais Kristaps" (in Latvian). Latvijas Kinematogrāfistu Savienība. 2016. Retrieved 29 November 2016. Prombergs, Māris (6 November 2015).
