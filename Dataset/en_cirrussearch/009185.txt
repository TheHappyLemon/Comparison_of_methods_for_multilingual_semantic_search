The Cyprus Football Association (CFA) (Greek: Κυπριακή Ομοσπονδία Ποδοσφαίρου (ΚΟΠ), romanized: Kypriakí Omospondía Podosfaírou (KOP)) is the governing body of football in Cyprus and is based in Nicosia. It organises Cyprus's football championships, whose top league is the Cypriot First Division. It also organises the Cypriot Cup, the Cypriot Super Cup and the Cypriot national football team. Cyprus Football Association is also responsible for organising futsal competitions, including the Cypriot Futsal league, the Cypriot Futsal Cup and the Cypriot Futsal Super Cup. Organised football was introduced to Cyprus early in the 20th century by the British. Initially played in the island's schools, it proved hugely popular and a number of clubs were duly formed. As football became established, the clubs were united in agreeing that an official body was needed to regulate the sport. On 23 September 1934, the Cyprus Football Association was founded by the following eight clubs: AEL Limassol, Anorthosis Famagusta, APOEL, Aris Limassol, EPA Larnaca, Olympiakos Nicosia, Lefkoşa Türk Spor Kulübü and Trust. After Cyprus Football Association's establishment, football began to be played on an official basis with the CFA organising various championships for its member clubs. Cyprus Football Association became a member of FIFA in 1948 and of UEFA in 1962. In 2007, Cyprus Football Association moved to its new headquarters in Nicosia. The opening ceremony was attended by UEFA president Michel Platini, and the president of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos. Chris Georgiades "Member Associations".
