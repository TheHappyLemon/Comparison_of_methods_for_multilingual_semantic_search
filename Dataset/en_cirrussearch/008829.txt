109 Piscium b (aka HD 10697 b) is a long-period extrasolar planet discovered in orbit around 109 Piscium. It is about 5.74 times the mass of Jupiter and is likely to be a gas giant. As is common for long-period planets discovered around other stars, it has an orbital eccentricity greater than that of Jupiter. The discoverers estimate its effective temperature as 264 K from solar heating, but it could be at least 10 to 20 K warmer because of internal heating. It orbits within the habitable zone. Preliminary astrometric measurements suggested that the orbital inclination is 170.3°, yielding an object mass of 38 times that of Jupiter, which would make it a brown dwarf. However, subsequent analysis indicates that the precision of the measurements used to derive the astrometric orbit is insufficient to constrain the parameters. A more plausible suggestion is that this planet shares its star's inclination, of 69+21 −26°. In 2022, the inclination and true mass of 109 Piscium b were measured via astrometry. The inclination estimate is consistent with that of the stellar rotation. 54 Piscium b – another nearby planet in the constellation of Pisces List of exoplanets discovered before 2000 "Astronomers discover six new planets orbiting nearby stars" (Press release).
