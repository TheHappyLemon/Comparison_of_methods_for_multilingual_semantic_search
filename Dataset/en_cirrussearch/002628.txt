"Perfect" is the fourth and final single released from Canadian rock band Simple Plan's debut album, No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls (2002). It became a top-40 hit in the band's native Canada as well as in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. The single's B-side, "Happy Together", is a cover of the 1967 Turtles song. "Perfect" was written by the band with music composer Arnold Lanni. Regarding the lyric "Hey dad, look at me" and "I'm sorry I can't be perfect". Drummer Chuck Comeau stated that this song "is his idea", to tell his parents that he is not perfect, he cannot be perfect because Comeau's parents were not supportive of his career choice, so in the song Comeau tells that he made it and he is not perfect and he cannot be perfect. Bassist and backing vocalist David Desrosiers also stated that this song was "about him" before he starts an acoustic version of the song. In another song of Simple Plan titled "Problem Child" (also sequel-alike for Perfect) from their fifth studio album Taking One for the Team (2016), Comeau stated that "Problem Child" is "a part 2 of Perfect". Comeau also stated that this song is about his brother who supports him in his music career. "Perfect" became Simple Plan's biggest hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 24. It was also a top-10 hit in Australia, peaking at number six, and reached number 14 in New Zealand. In 2005, the song become band's first top-10 single on the Canadian Singles Chart, peaking at number five. In the music video of the single, directed by Liz Friedlander, the band are playing on the roof of a house.
