"She" is a song by the American rock band Green Day. It is the eighth track on their third album, Dookie and was released as Green Day's first promotional single in their discography. The song was written by frontman Billie Joe Armstrong about a former girlfriend who showed him a feminist poem with an identical title. In return, Armstrong wrote the lyrics of "She" and showed them to her. She later dumped him and moved to Ecuador, prompting Armstrong to put "She" on the album. The same ex-girlfriend is the topic of the songs "Sassafras Roots" and "Chump". It is one of the few Green Day singles that did not have a music video. The song has been frequently listed as one of Green Day's best songs. Kerrang! listed it as their second best song, while Rolling Stone listed it as their seventh. PopMatters listed "She" as the eighth best Green Day song, citing ""She" is sensitive without being soft; in between Armstrong's empathetic declarations of "Scream at me / Until my ears bleed / I'm taking heed / Just for you", the band is hammering away at its instruments with amped-up intensity." In 2016, British-American band As It Is covered the song for the Green Day cover album "American Superhits!". In 2018, Californian punk-ska band Mad Caddies covered the song with a reggae beat for their cover album Punk Rocksteady. "Green Day - Fantasy Studios" (PDF). Fantasy Studios.

Issued in February 1994, Dookie would spawn five hit singles — 'Longview', 'Welcome To Paradise' (a re‐recording of a track on Kerplunk), 'Basket Case', 'When I Come Around' and 'She' — and, with worldwide sales of over 16 million units, would prove to be the group's most popular work, while establishing them at the forefront of the neo-punk scene.
