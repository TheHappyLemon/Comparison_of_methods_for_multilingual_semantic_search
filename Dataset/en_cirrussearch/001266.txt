The first orbital flight of an artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched in October 1957, by the Soviet Union. In November, the second orbital flight took place. The Soviet Union launched the first animal to orbit the Earth, a dog, Laika, who died in orbit a few hours after launch. Thor, Atlas, and R-7 rocket families all have maiden flights this year, all three of which will have long legacies for the next 50+ years Australia and the UK go to space with sounding rockets; first space launches from Australia The R-12 makes its maiden flight The US makes its first orbital attempt and fails (Vanguard TV-3) 14 28 42 56 70 Viking/ Vanguard Aerobee Rockoon Nike/ Deacon Sergeant Honest John Jupiter Thor Atlas R-1 R-2 R-5 R-7 R-12 Others   Viking (second model)   Vanguard   Aerobee RTV-N-10   Aerobee RTV-N-10c   Aerobee Hi (NRL)   Aerobee RTV-A-1a   Aerobee Hi (USAF)   Aerobee AJ10-34   Aerobee (Unknown)   Loki rockoon   Farside   Nike-Deacon   Nike-Cajun   Terrapin   Nike-Asp   X-17   Polaris FTV-5   Polaris FTV-3   HJ-Nike   HJ-Nike-Nike   Jupiter-C   SM-78 Jupiter   XSM-75 Thor   XSM-65A Atlas   R-1   A-1   R-2   R-2A   R-5M   R-7   Sputnik-PS (8K71PS)   R-12   Skylark (Raven 1)   Long Tom Timeline of spaceflight Pre-1963 Designations Of U.S. Missiles And Drones Bergin, Chris.
