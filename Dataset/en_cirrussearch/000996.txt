"Pressure" is a song by American rock band Paramore, released on August 2, 2005 as their debut single from their debut studio album, All We Know Is Falling.

On March 24, 2016, the song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for sales exceeding 500,000. A music video directed by Shane Drake was released for the track in 2005. The video opens with Paramore playing in an abandoned warehouse. An intertwined storyline of the video is of young man who deals with the struggles of working at a fast food restaurant and trying to please his boss. A girl who is modeling is judged on what she wants to eat and what she wants to wear. All throughout the video, a pressure dial is shown and rises as the pressure builds for the two people. The man then quits his job after getting fed up with his boss and goes to the model. He signals to her to come with him but she's stuck preparing for a photoshoot. To get her out, the man sets off a fire alarm that causes the sprinklers in the building to go off. Simultaneously, sprinklers are set off on the band in the warehouse as the final chorus kicks in. The video closes with the couple escaping together and the band getting drenched in water. As of November 2023, the music video for "Pressure" has over 50 million views on YouTube. New Found Glory has covered "Pressure" live. A mash-up of this song features Ludacris's vocals from How Low and Lil Wayne's from Look At Me Now. The song was featured as a track on the console version of The Sims 2 if you interact with a radio or stereo. As per usual for the series, the song was re-recorded with the lyrics in Simlish.
