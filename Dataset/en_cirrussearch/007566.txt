40 (forty) is the natural number following 39 and preceding 41. Though the word is related to four (4), the spelling forty replaced fourty during the 17th century and is now the standard form. Forty is the fourth octagonal number. As the sum of the first four pentagonal numbers: 1+5+12+22=40{\displaystyle 1+5+12+22=40}, it is also the fourth pentagonal pyramidal number. Forty is a repdigit in ternary, and a Harshad number in decimal. 40 is an abundant number, because the sum of its proper divisors is greater than 40. 40 is the smallest number n{\displaystyle n} with exactly nine solutions to the equation Euler's totient function φ(x)=n{\displaystyle \varphi (x)=n} (for values 41, 55, 75, 82, 88, 100, 110, 132, and 150 of x{\displaystyle x}). Adding up some subsets of the divisors of 40 (e.g., 1, 4, 5, 10, and 20) gives 40; hence, 40 is the ninth semiperfect number. 40 is also the ninth refactorable number. 40 is the algebraic polynomial degree of six-cycle logistic map, r6.{\displaystyle r_{6}.} Forty is the number of n-queens problem solutions for n=7{\displaystyle n=7}. Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler noted forty prime numbers generated by the quadratic polynomial n2+n+41{\displaystyle n^{2}+n+41}, with values n=0,1,2,...,39 {\displaystyle n=0,1,2,...,39{\text{ }}}: 41, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, 83, 97, 113, 131, 151, 173, 197, 223, 251, 281, 313, 347, 383, 421, 461, 503, 547, 593, 641, 691, 743, 797, 853, 911, 971, 1033, 1097, 1163, 1231, 1301, 1373, 1447, 1523, and 1601. The differences between terms are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 78 (equivalently, up through a difference of twice 39, the twelfth triangular number). The first such prime (41) is the thirteenth prime number, where 13 divides the largest n{\displaystyle n} thrice over. The last such prime (1601) is the two hundred and fifty-second prime number (where 252 is the sum between two through twenty-two, inclusive) as well as one more than the square of forty, 402 = 1600. Importantly, 41 is also the largest of six lucky numbers of Euler of the form, m2−m+n; m={0,⋯,n−1}.{\displaystyle m^{2}-m+n;{\text{ }}m=\{0,\cdots ,n-1\}.} These forty prime numbers are the same prime numbers that are generated using the polynomial n2−n+41{\displaystyle n^{2}-n+41} with values of n{\displaystyle n} from 1 through 40, and are also known in this context as Euler's "lucky" numbers. Given 40, the Mertens function M(n){\displaystyle M(n)} returns 0{\displaystyle 0}, as with 39; the only other smaller number to return a value of zero is 2. Adding 39 and 40 yields the twenty-second indexed prime, 79, equal to the sum of all six lucky numbers of Euler {2,3,5,11,17,41}{\displaystyle \{2,3,5,11,17,41\}}. 40 also lies between the 8th pair of sexy primes (37, 43) — the former the difference of 2 and 39, that also multiply to 78 — which represent the only two points in the set of natural numbers N{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } where the ratio of prime numbers to composite numbers (in adjacency, up to) is 12{\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}}. The atomic number of zirconium. Negative forty is the unique temperature at which the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales correspond; that is, −40 °F = −40 °C. It is referred to as either "minus forty" or "forty below". Messier object M40, a magnitude 9.0 double star in the constellation Ursa Major The New General Catalogue object NGC 40, a magnitude 12.4 planetary nebula in the constellation Cepheus The number 40 is found in many traditions without any universal explanation for its use. In Jewish, Christian, Islamic, and other Middle Eastern traditions it is taken to represent a large, approximate number, similar to "umpteen". Enki ( /ˈɛŋki/) or Enkil (Sumerian: dEN.KI(G)𒂗𒆠) is a god in Sumerian mythology, later known as Ea in Akkadian and Babylonian mythology. He was originally patron god of the city of Eridu, but later the influence of his cult spread throughout Mesopotamia and to the Canaanites, Hittites and Hurrians. He was the deity of crafts (gašam); mischief; water, seawater, lake water (a, aba, ab), intelligence (gestú, literally "ear") and creation (Nudimmud: nu, likeness, dim mud, make bear). He was associated with the southern band of constellations called stars of Ea, but also with the constellation AŠ-IKU, the Field (Square of Pegasus). Beginning around the second millennium BCE, he was sometimes referred to in writing by the numeric ideogram for "40", occasionally referred to as his "sacred number". A large number of myths about Enki have been collected from many sites, stretching from Southern Iraq to the Levantine coast. He figures in the earliest extant cuneiform inscriptions throughout the region and was prominent from the third millennium down to Hellenistic times. The exact meaning of his name is uncertain: the common translation is "Lord of the Earth": the Sumerian en is translated as a title equivalent to "lord"; it was originally a title given to the High Priest; ki means "earth"; but there are theories that the ki in this name has another origin, possibly kig of unknown meaning, or kur meaning "mound". The name Ea is allegedly Hurrian in origin while others claim that it is possibly of Semitic origin and may be a derivation from the West-Semitic root *hyy meaning "life" in this case used for "spring", "running water". In Sumerian E-A means "the house of water", and it has been suggested that this was originally the name for the shrine to the God at Eridu. In the Hebrew Bible, forty is often used for time periods, forty days or forty years, which separate "two distinct epochs". Rain fell for "forty days and forty nights" during the Flood (Genesis 7:4).

Examples include Eli (1 Samuel 4:18), Saul (Acts 13:21), David (2 Samuel 5:4), and Solomon (1 Kings 11:42). Goliath challenged the Israelites twice a day for forty days before David defeated him (1 Samuel 17:16). Moses spent three consecutive periods of "forty days and forty nights" on Mount Sinai: He went up on the seventh day of Sivan, after God gave the Torah to the Jewish people, in order to learn the Torah from God, and came down on the seventeenth day of Tammuz, when he saw the Jews worshiping the Golden Calf and broke the tablets (Deuteronomy 9:11). He went up on the eighteenth day of Tammuz to beg forgiveness for the people's sin and came down without God's atonement on the twenty-ninth day of Av (Deuteronomy 9:25). He went up on the first day of Elul and came down on the tenth day of Tishrei, the first Yom Kippur, with God's atonement (Deuteronomy 10:10).

(Numbers 14:33–34) alludes to the same[clarification needed] with ties to the prophecy in The Book of Daniel. "For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have Me against you."

In modern Christian practice, Lent consists of the 40 days preceding Easter. In much of Western Christianity, Sundays are excluded from the count, there are 46 days in total of Lent; in Eastern Christianity Saturdays and Sundays are excluded, which brings the total to 48 days (7 weeks minus Easter Sunday). Eastern Christianity also keeps a 40-day fast before Christmas (Advent Lent). The Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. Kirk Kilisse, "Forty Churches" (Σαράντα Εκκλησιές) in Eastern Thrace.

Some Russians, Bulgarians, and Serbs believe that ghosts of the dead linger at the site of their death for forty days. After the forty days, additional prayers are performed at the grave (parastos (парастос) or panihida (панихида)), to escort the soul on its way to God's court. Many Christian Filipinos mark the end of the initial mourning period on the fortieth day after death, and have a Mass said.
