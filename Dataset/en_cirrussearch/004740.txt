The Szczecin tram system is a 12-line, standard gauge tramway system in Szczecin, Poland, that has been in operation since 1879 (when the town was Stettin, Prussia). The tramway operates on 65 kilometers (40 mi) of route. There are two depots and twelve balloon loops (including five street ones). Daytime lines (night lines were abolished in 1996) are operated by the company Tramwaje Szczecińskie (Szczecin Tramways), on behalf of the ZDiTM (Zarząd Dróg i Transportu Miejskiego [pl]; Road and Public Transport Administration). There is also a tourist line operated by the Szczecin's Association of the Enthusiasts of Public Transport. On October 21, 1872, just before the demolition of fortress walls, German engineer Johannes Bussing received from the Royal Police Directorate in Berlin concession for the construction of a horse tram network. Less than six years later, an important agreement with the city have been signed . On March 25, 1879, the company Stettiner Straßen-Eisenbahn Gesellschaft was established in the same year the first horse tram lines were launched. On August 23, the first line, which began nearby of pl. Gałczyńskiego, lead through pl. Zwycięstwa and ended at Staszica Street. On October 16, the second line from Wiszesława Street to Potulicka Street was opened. The length of both routes rose to 11.5 km. Initially, in Szczecin there was 16 trams and 80 horses, and in 1898 there were 39 trams and 198 horses. In 1886, two new lines were opened : from the Szczecin Główny railway station to Chmielewskiego Street and from Wyszyńskiego Street to Nabrzeże Wieleckie. The first depot was located at the intersection of Wojska Polskiego avenue and Piotra Skargi Street. Later another 3 were established : at Dębogórska Street, Dubois Street and Kolumba Street. From 1896 to 1900, most of lines had become electric. Electrification have been performed by Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft.
