The China women's national basketball team (Chinese: 中国国家女子篮球队) represents the People's Republic of China in international women's basketball tournaments. The national team is governed by the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). Basketball was first introduced in China by YMCA missionaries by the second half of the 1890s, remaining popular in urban areas during the Republican period. With the creation of the People's Republic fo China, the sport retained its popularity, being introduced in PE in schools. The first color movie in China about sports was Xie Jin's Woman Basketball Player No. 5, from 1957. By the 1970s, basketball was, alongside volleyball, one of the most popular women's sport in the country. China stayed out of international competicions since 1958, when the International Olympic Committee chose Taiwan as the representative of the country. After the People's Republic of China became the representative of China in international competitions, the basketball team won several accolades, including several golds in the Asian Games and the Asia Cup, a third place in the 1984 Summer Olympics, and a third place in the 1983 Women's World Cup. For the first time since 1994, China got a medal in the 2022 Women's World Cup after being defeated by Team USA in the finals. 1984 – 3rd place 1988 – 6th place 1992 – 2nd place 1996 – 9th place 2004 – 9th place 2008 – 4th place 2012 – 6th place 2016 – 10th place 2020 – 5th place 2024 – Qualified 1983 – 3rd place 1986 – 5th place 1990 – 9th place 1994 – 2nd place 1998 – 12th place 2002 – 6th place 2006 – 12th place 2010 – 13th place 2014 – 6th place 2018 – 6th place 2022 – 2nd place Gold: 1976, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2009, 2011, 2023 Silver: 1978, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 2007, 2015, 2019, 2021 Bronze: 1997, 2013, 2017 Gold; 1982, 1986, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2018, 2022 Silver; 1978, 1990, 1998, 2014 Bronze; 1974, 1994 Roster for the 2023 FIBA Women's Asia Cup.
