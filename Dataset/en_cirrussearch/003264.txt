Marcus Terrell Thornton (born June 5, 1987) is an American professional basketball player for the Eberlein Drive of The Basketball Tournament.

He has played in the NBA for the New Orleans Hornets, Sacramento Kings, Brooklyn Nets, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, Houston Rockets and Washington Wizards. Thornton played two years at Kilgore College, a junior college in Kilgore, Texas. As a freshman in 2005–06, he averaged 14.5 points while shooting at 65 percent from the field. He averaged 26.9 points in his second season at Kilgore in 2006–07, earning first-team Junior College All-American honors and MVP honors for Region XIV. Following his sophomore season, Thornton transferred to Louisiana State University. As a junior in 2007–08 playing for the Tigers, he averaged 19.6 points (second in the SEC) and shot 81.7 percent from the free-throw line, the second-best percentage in the conference. As a senior in 2008–09, he averaged 21.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game, subsequently earning the 2009 Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year. In two seasons at LSU, he finished with 1,347 points, 21st all-time and with a 20.4 scoring average, he ranked sixth all-time. He also finished eighth in school history with 168 three-pointers. Thornton was selected with the 43rd overall pick by the Miami Heat in the 2009 NBA draft, but his rights were traded to the New Orleans Hornets. On February 23, 2010, in a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, he tied a Hornets' franchise record for points scored by a rookie (37), and set a franchise record for points in a quarter (23) and points off the bench (previous, 33, Dell Curry). His 37 points also tied for the third most points by an NBA rookie off the bench since the 1976–77 season. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in 2009–10 after averaging 14.5 points, 2.9 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 25.6 minutes per game in 73 games (started 17) with New Orleans. He also set a franchise rookie record with 117 three-pointers in a season. On February 23, 2011, Thornton was traded to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Carl Landry.

He completed the 2014–15 season with the Suns playing in just nine games. He did not manage game time in 18 of a possible 27 games with the Suns, largely thanks to an Achilles' tendon injury and being a non-rotation player on a non-playoff team.

On February 18, 2016, Thornton and Donatas Motiejūnas were traded to the Detroit Pistons in a three-team trade involving the Rockets and the Philadelphia 76ers.

Two days later, he made his debut with the Wizards in a 114–93 loss to the Utah Jazz, recording two points, one assist and one steal in 20 minutes off the bench.
