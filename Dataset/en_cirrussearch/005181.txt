A game, Rock the Beat, on Hannah Montana's official website was made to promote the album, currently featuring eight songs in the soundtrack. Walt Disney Records also advertised the album outside of Disney, by sending commercials to teen-oriented channels. Hannah Montana 3 received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Heather Phares of AllMusic, spoke of the album negatively, even more than Hannah Montana 2 and Hannah Montana: The Movie. On the review, Phares complains that the albums have not grown since the commence of the franchise by stating: "Miley Cyrus was 13 years old when she started performing as Hannah Montana, but by the time Hannah Montana 3 was released, she was nearly 17. That's a pretty big span of time in a teenager's life, but you'd never know it from listening to these songs." Another point which was brought by the reviewer was that the alteration from "fizzy pop" to "searching ballads" was too sudden. She described "Ice Cream Freeze (Let's Chill)" as "extremely similar" to Cyrus's own "Hoedown Throwdown" which wasn't received well by critics and others were too "equally cookie-cutter". To AllMusic the nadir of the album is "Just a Girl". She mentioned "the only thing worse than a big star singing about how fame has damaged her is a big child star singing about how fame has damaged her." Overall she said: "Hannah Montana 3 seems to give fans exactly what they want, but the calculation behind this music overwhelms the fun that used to be in it." Warren Truit of About.com, looked at the album also from "a preteen's point of view" and taking into account that the songs are not supposed to represent her real life. Truit compared "It's All Right Here" and "He Could Be the One" to Shania Twain. He said the songs were a mix of Gwen Stefani, Joan Jett and Avril Lavigne with "fizzy Radio Disney pop rock". They also felt "Ice Cream Freeze" was just as "goofy" as "Hoedown Throwdown". As a summary he commented: "When it comes down to it, the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack is harmless, poppy fun for preteen music fans. The tunes on the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack may be a little cookie-cutter, but at least the songwriters realize who their audience is and they deliver the goods, unlike the Jonas Brothers' recent genre-jumping mishmash disaster Lines, Vines and Trying Times. Hannah Montana devotees will absolutely love the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack, and parents can actually tolerate most of the songs on the album." Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly, was also on a lighter and more positive perspective on the album. He said: "Teen-pop partisans worried by Miley Cyrus' Nashville vibe in Hannah Montana The Movie can breathe easy: These tunes from Cyrus' TV show trade the fiddles for bubble-grunge guitars. I Wanna Know You, a duet with David Archuleta, is a mite too earnest, but Supergirl rocks like primo Kelly Clarkson." Hannah Montana 3 debuted and peaked at number two in the United States's chart, Billboard 200, selling 137,000 copies with a good amount being purchased online due to it charting at number 5 in the Top Digital Albums and number 18 in Top Internet Albums. On other charts in the US, such as Top Kid Audio and Top Soundtracks, the album debuted in the top spot. In Top Soundtracks, the franchise replaced herself at number 1, Hannah Montana: The Movie was previously in the top slot and descended to number 2. Cyrus was at the first two positions for several weeks. In its second week, Hannah Montana 3 slid down one spot, to number 3 with 73,000 copies sold (down 47%) in Billboard 200, meanwhile it stayed at number 1 for Top Kid Albums and Top Soundtracks; in the third week of it charting, Hannah Montana 3 fell to number 5. In its fourth week on the charts it slid down to number seven with 41,000 copies sold. In Canada, the album also debuted at number two, losing the top spot to the third run of Black Eyed Peas' album, The E.N.D. In its second week, the album fell to the fourth spot on the chart and later the sixth. Hannah Montana 3 debuted and peaked at number 40 in Norway. In Mexico, the series' third soundtrack debuted at number 27, the week after, it ascended to number 26. Credits adapted from AllMusic.
