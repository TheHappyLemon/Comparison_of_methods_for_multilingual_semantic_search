In the first game, the United States jumped out to a 10–2 lead and never looked back in a 22-point victory over Slovenia.

Croatia rebounded from a Day One loss to the United States by beating winless Iran 75–54.

Brazil remained undefeated by beating Tunisia 80–65 in the day's final game. Leandro Barbosa scored 21 points – 16 in the first quarter alone – and grabbed 6 rebounds while Tiago Splitter added 16 points. Day 3 of Group B action finally brought three competitive games. The two former Yugoslav republics faced off in the day's first game in a rematch of the Eurobasket 2009 quarterfinal. Like the Eurobasket quarterfinal, Slovenia again prevailed, this time with a 91–84 victory over the Croatians. Slovenia quickly erased a five-point halftime deficit, taking the lead for good on Miha Zupan's three-pointer with 6:33 remaining in the game. Poor free-throw shooting proved to be Croatia's undoing, as they shot only 15 of 26 from the foul line. Uroš Slokar and Jaka Lakovič each scored 15 points for the Slovenians, while Roko Ukić scored a game-high 20 points for Croatia in the losing effort. Tournament debutants Iran and Tunisia faced off in the second game of the day, each looking for their first ever World Championship victory. The Iranians came away with the victory after Hamed Haddadi turned in another strong performance (23 points, 13 rebounds). Iran opened up a 24-point second half lead as Tunisia struggled to shoot the ball, scoring only 36 points in the first three quarters. The Tunisians used a furious 21–2 run to pull to within three with five minutes left before Iran pulled away for the victory. Unbeaten Brazil and United States met in the day's final game in a match that would determine the group winner, in all likelihood. Brazil was again without the services of Anderson Varejão, who rested with a sprained right ankle after expecting to be ready for the game. Brazil led for much of the first three quarters in a tight game before Derrick Rose made a shot that gave the USA a 52–50 lead that they would not relinquish until the fourth quarter. After Brazil tied the game in the fourth, Lamar Odom's dunk with 7:13 left that gave the Americans a 64–62 lead that they would not relinquish. Brazil had two chances to send the game to overtime in the final seconds, but Marcelo Huertas missed two free throws and Leandro Barbosa's shot clanged off the rim as time expired. Kevin Durant led the Americans with 27 points and 10 rebounds as most of the Americans struggled in their first real challenge of the tournament. Rest day. Group B was back in action on September 1 following a rest day. In the first game of the day, Tunisia continued to struggle as Croatia jumped out to a 20-point halftime lead en route to an 84–64 victory. Bojan Bogdanović led the Croatians with 19 points while Makrem Ben Romdhane was the only Tunisian in double figures, with a game-high 23 points. The victory, coupled with Iran's loss, clinched a spot in the knockout round for Croatia. Tunisia, meanwhile, was eliminated with the loss. The Americans clinched first place in the group with an 88–51 victory over Iran in the day's second game. Iran provided some resistance for the lethargic Americans, trailing by single digits for much of the first half before being outscored by 23 in the second half.Kevin Love led the Americans with 13 points in only 11 minutes of action, while Hamed Haddadi again led the Iranians with 19 points. In the battle for second place in the group, Slovenia beat Brazil 80–77 despite Anderson Varejão making his tournament debut for the Brazilians. Primož Brezec hit his first seven shots to help Slovenia take a 14-point halftime lead. Brazil cut the lead to two with 4 minutes remaining but could come no closer as Slovenia clinched second place in the group. Slovenia's loss also eliminated Iran from contention, sending Croatia and Brazil to the knockout round. There was little to play for on Day 5 of Group B play, as only Brazil and Croatia had positions to play for. The United States sleepwalked to a six-point halftime lead before taking over in the second half in a 92–57 victory over Tunisia. Eric Gordon scored 21 points as the United States finished group play undefeated for the second consecutive World Championship. Tunisia ended their first World Championship appearance without a win. In the day's second game, Slovenia held off a late charge by Iran in a 65–60 victory. Hamed Haddadi scored 15 points to conclude a strong tournament for the Iranian team. The only game of the day with implication in the standings had little drama as Brazil rebounded from two straight losses dominated Croatia in a 92–74 victory. With the victory, Brazil clinched third place in the group to set up a quarterfinal match with rivals and Group A runner-up Argentina.
