Dobra [ˈdɔbra] (German: Daber), also known as Dobra Nowogardzka, is a town in Łobez County, West Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northwestern Poland, with 2,215 inhabitants as of December 2021. In the Middle Ages a Slavic gród existed in present-day Dobra. In the 10th century the area became part of the emerging Polish state under Mieszko I of Poland. It was granted town rights before 1331. In the 13th and 14th centuries a castle was built, rebuilt later in the 16th century, and heavily damaged in the 17th to 19th centuries. In 1647, due to the plague epidemic, the population of Dobra fell from over 600 to 48 people. From the 18th century, it was part of Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was also part of Germany. In 1895, a narrow-gauge railway was built, connecting the town with Stargard. Following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II it became again part of Poland.
