West Africa Time, or WAT, is a time zone used in west-central Africa. West Africa Time is one hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC+01:00), which aligns it with Central European Time (CET) during winter, and Western European Summer Time (WEST) / British Summer Time (BST) during summer. As most of this time zone is in the tropical region, there is little change in day length throughout the year and therefore daylight saving time is not observed. West Africa Time is the time zone for the following countries:  Algeria (as Central European Time)  Angola  Benin  Cameroon  Central African Republic  Chad  Democratic Republic of the Congo (western provinces)  Equatorial Guinea  Gabon  Morocco (as Central European Time)  Niger  Nigeria  Republic of the Congo  Tunisia (as Central European Time)  Western Sahara Countries west of Benin (except Morocco and Western Sahara) are in the UTC±0 time zone. Civil time in most of those countries is defined with reference to Greenwich Mean Time[citation needed] (now an alias for UTC±0, rather than an independent reference).
