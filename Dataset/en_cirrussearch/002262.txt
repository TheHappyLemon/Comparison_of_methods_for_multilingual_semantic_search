Biruta Baumane (6 June 1922 – 21 January 2017) was a Latvian figurative painter, one of the most notable of her generation of 20th century artists who developed the "harsh style" as a variety of Socialist realism that dominated in the late 1950s and 1960s in Latvian art. She is best known for her figural scenes, still lifes, portraits and women nudes. She was an honorary member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences and Artists’ Union of Latvia. The daughter of teachers Fricis and Lūcija, she was born Biruta Frīdberga on 6 June 1922 in Kalnamuiža, Tērvete parish, Latvia.

In 1942, parallel to her studies at the Academy, she entered the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Latvia, but the department was closed down and she moved to the Faculty of Philology in 1944. However, she didn’t succeed in the university final exams.
