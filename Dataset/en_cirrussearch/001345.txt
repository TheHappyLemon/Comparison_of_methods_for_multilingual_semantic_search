Schlierenzauer has been deaf in his left ear since birth. He is also the cousin of luger Hannah Prock. At age eight, Schlierenzauer began training in ski jumping at SV Innsbruck–Bergisel club. He attended an ordinary Austrian grammar school, however, due to tight schedules in both sport and school, he had problems keeping up with his class work. Schlierenzauer then enrolled at Skigymnasium Stams in Austria, the world's oldest ski-sport training center and boarding secondary school. He currently resides in Fulpmes, Tyrol. Schlierenzauer began competing professionally in the 2005/06 season in the Continental Cup, then only fifteen years old.

On 3 December 2006, Schlierenzauer took his first World Cup victory in Lillehammer, Norway, and became one of the youngest jumpers to ever win a world cup competition. He also won in Oberstdorf, Germany, at the Four Hills Tournament 2006/07. During the Four Hills Tournament, Finnish newspapers claimed that Schlierenzauer was extremely underweight, however, no evidence has ever been found to substantiate this accusation. He won the fourth competition, in Bischofshofen, Austria, on his 17th birthday, but finished the tournament in second place, behind Anders Jacobsen (Norway), and in front of Simon Ammann (Switzerland). Schlierenzauer took fourth place in World Cup 2006/07. He was second, but Adam Małysz from Poland ended up taking the first-place position from Anders Jacobsen, so Schlierenzauer finished third. His coach deemed the event in Planica too demanding for 17-year-old Schlierenzauer, so he did not compete there and ended finishing fourth, behind Adam Małysz, Anders Jacobsen and Simon Ammann. At the beginning of the World Cup 2007/08, Schlierenzauer took 2nd place on the World Cup list, behind his teammate Thomas Morgenstern.

At the end of the Four Hills Tournament, he ended up in 12th place. He skipped the competitions in Predazzo, where Tom Hilde from Norway took his first World Cup victory, and in Harrachov. On 25 January 2008, Schlierenzauer took his second World Cup victory in Zakopane, Poland. He also skipped the competition in Sapporo, ruining his chance to take the first-place position from his Austrian teammate Thomas Morgenstern. After two-second-place finishes in Liberec and an eighth-place finish in Willingen, he took part in the FIS Ski Flying World Championships in Oberstdorf in 2008. After four series of competing, he won the gold medal, on 23 February 2008.

Schlierenzauer celebrated his first victory of the 2011/12 season in Harrachov on 9 December 2011. On 6 January 2012, Schlierenzauer won the Four Hills Tournament for the first time. On 15 January 2012, at the second ski flying competition on the Kulm, Schlierenzauer's jump suit tore just before his jump and could not be repaired, but Schlierenzauer still jumped to victory with a superior jump, but was disqualified due to the suit. This disqualification ultimately cost him the overall World Cup. As of 5 February 2012, Schlierenzauer has 40 World Cup victories, overtaking Adam Malysz. At the end of the season he finished second in the overall World Cup, behind Norwegian Anders Bardal.

He finished 8th at the Four Hills Tournament and also took two podium finishes at the Kulm ski-flying events. However, he could not build on his past dominance in the World Cup and so the Olympic Winter Games in Sochi were disappointing for him. He finished 11th on the normal hill and 7th on the large hill. With the team it was enough for a silver medal. At the end of the season he finished 6th overall. The 2014/15 season was also difficult for Schlierenzauer. After poor performances at the beginning of the season, he managed to win the first competition in Lillehammer, it was his 53 and last World Cup victory.
