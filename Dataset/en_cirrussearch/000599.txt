Yatabaré was born in the French town of Beauvais, and began his career at his hometown club AS Beauvais. He stayed at the club until 2005, before signing for Amiens SC, to be part of the youth system. In 2006, he joined Championnat National side Villemomble Sports, scoring eight goals in 25 appearances, before earning a move to Ligue 2 side Clermont Foot in 2008. Yatabaré moved to Ligue 1 side US Boulogne in January 2010. They were relegated at the end of the season. During the summer of 2011, Yatabaré moved to the Ligue 2 side En Avant de Guingamp. He did not score in his first season. At the beginning of the 2012–13 season, he scored eight goals within the ten first games, including successive goals from the sixth to the tenth game. He finished that season as the Ligue 2 top scorer, with 23 goals, and contributed six assists. His goal-scoring exploits helped earn the Briton club promotion back into Ligue 1 after two years in the second division. Yatabaré scored his first goal of the 2013–14 Ligue 1 season on the opening day of the campaign, but it came in a losing effort as Guingamp fell 3–1 to Marseille. He scored his sixth league goal on 25 January 2014 in Guingamp's 1–1 draw with reigning champions PSG.

He headed in a cross from Steeven Langil for his eighth goal of the Coupe de France campaign, securing Guingamp's second Coupe de France championship. On 2 August 2014, in the Trophée des Champions against Paris Saint-Germain at the Workers Stadium in Beijing, Yatabaré took a penalty in the 32nd minute after Claudio Beauvue had been fouled by Marquinhos. It was saved by Salvatore Sirigu and Guingamp lost 2–0. On 1 September 2014, Yatabaré signed for Süper Lig side Trabzonspor on a three-year deal. The transfer fee paid to Guingamp was reported as €2.5 million. After one season in Turkey, Yatabaré signed for Ligue 1 side Montpellier on a season-long loan deal, while Montpellier was given an option to sign him permanently. On 24 July 2019, Yatabaré left Konyaspor and signed a two-year contract with fellow Süper Lig club Sivasspor.

He finished the season as the club's top scorer with 12 goals. He left the club on 1 July 2023 when his contract expired. On 14 July 2023, Yatabaré joined Gençlerbirliği on an initial one-year deal with the club having an option to extend his contract for a further two seasons. In November 2008, Yatabaré earned himself a call-up to the Mali national football team, following his impressive club displays.
