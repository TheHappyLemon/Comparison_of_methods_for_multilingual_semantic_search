Lillie Glacier (70°45′S 163°55′E﻿ / ﻿70.750°S 163.917°E﻿ / -70.750; 163.917) is a large glacier in Antarctica, about 100 nautical miles (190 km; 120 mi) long and 10 nautical miles (19 km; 12 mi) wide. It lies between the Bowers Mountains on the west and the Concord Mountains and Anare Mountains on the east, flowing to Ob' Bay on the coast and forming the Lillie Glacier Tongue. The glacier tongue was discovered by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13, and was named by the expedition for Dennis G. Lillie, a biologist on the Terra Nova. The name Lillie has since been extended to the entire glacier. The lower half of the glacier was plotted by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE) (Thala Dan) in 1962, which explored the area and utilized air photos taken by United States Navy Operation Highjump, 1946–47. The whole feature was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960–62. On 22 October 1964 a United States Navy ski-equipped LC-47 airplane flew from Hallett Station to establish a cache of fuel drums on Lillie Glacier for army helicopters to use when supporting a scientific party later in the season. After unloading the drums and taking off, the plane developed engine trouble and was forced to land on the glacier again. There were no serious injuries. The Lillie Glacier forms below the Evans Névé, fed by the Lloyd Icefall to the east of the East Quartzite Range and southwest of the Victory Mountains. It flows north through the Concord Mountains between the King Range to the west and the Mirabito Range to the east. To the north of Toilers Mountain in the King Range it is joined by Black Glacier from the west, and then by McCann Glacier north of Markinsenis Peak. The Black Glacier forms between the Salamander Range and the Neall Massif and flows north. Houliston Glacier joins Black Glacier from the east to the south of the Leitch Massif. Rawle Glacier joins it from the east to the north of the Leitch Massif. The Black Glacier is joined from the west by Leap Year Glacier before joining Lille Glacier. North of Mount Radspinner the Lillie Glacier is joined by Champness Glacier from the west, and then at the north end of the Mirabito Range by the Greenwell Glacier from the east. The Greenwell Glacier forms and flows northeast between the Mirabito Range to the west and the Homerun Range to the east. At its head it is joined to the Jutland Glacier and Plata Glacier. Just before entering the Lillie Glacier it is joined from the east by the Horne Glacier. The Lillie Glacier flow north between the Posey Range to the west and the Everett Range to the east. Past Everett Spur it is joined from the east by the Ebbe Glacier. The Ebbe Glacier forms to the east of the Homerun Range and flows northwest and then west between the Everett Range to the southwest and the Anare Mountains to the northeast. It is fed from the Anare Mountains by Robertson Glacier, which enters from the north. The Lillie Glacier is then joined from the east by the McLean Glacier, the Beaman Glacier and the George Glacier flowing from the Anare Mountains. The George Glacier flows into the Lillie Glacier Tongue. Before reaching its mouth on the west the Lillie Glacier flows north west past the Flensing Icefall. This is fed by the Graveson Glacier from the north. The Graveson Glacier forms west of Mount Verhage and flows north between the Explorers Range and the Posey Range. It is joined by the Smithson Glacier from the east and the McLin Glacier, Irwin Glacier, Montigny Glacier and Van Loon Glacier from the west. The McLin and Irwin glaciers are both fed by the Edlin Névé. The Lillie Glacier is also fed by the Rastorguey Glacier and the Crawford Glacier from the west. Tributaries from the right (east) are, from south to north, 72°04′S 165°27′E﻿ / ﻿72.067°S 165.450°E﻿ / -72.067; 165.450.
