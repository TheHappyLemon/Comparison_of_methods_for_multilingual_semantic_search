David Range The David Range (67°54′S 62°30′E﻿ / ﻿67.900°S 62.500°E﻿ / -67.900; 62.500 is a mountain range that extends for 26 kilometres (16 mi) in the Framnes Mountains of Mac.Robertson Land in Antarctica. The range is surrounded by, and largely covered by, an ice sheet. Only the peaks are visible.

The peaks of the Masson Range and Casey Range were also visible in the mirage. On 14 February 1931 the range was mapped from the Discovery. Sir Douglas Mawson, named the range for Professor Edgeworth David of the BANZARE committee.

Robertson Land The 'David Range (67°54′S 62°30′E﻿ / ﻿67.900°S 62.500°E﻿ / -67.900; 62.500) is 5 miles (8 km) west of the Masson Range, which it parallels, in the Framnes Mountains of Antarctica. It extends 16 miles (26 km) in a north-northeast–south-southwest direction. The range is about 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) south of Holme Bay. The range lies to the southwest of Mawson Station. The northern tip of the range is nearly 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) due west of the northern tip of the Masson Range. The Brown Range (or Sortindane Peaks) is to the south and the Casey Range to the east. The highest point is the peak of Mount Elliot, at about 1,300 metres (4,300 ft). According to the 1960 Sailing Directions for Antarctica The David Range lies parallel to the Masson Range and about 5 miles to the westward. It is a striking rugged mass stretching southward about 15 miles. It is about 3,500 feet high with the highest elevation in Mount Coates, about 4,600 feet high, near the southern end of the ridge. Mount Hordern, about 4,954 feet high, is a conspicuous mountain lying about 5 miles southward of the Coates massif. The Framnes Mountains have elevations up to 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) above sea level, and rise up to 400 metres (1,300 ft) above the ice surface. They have dark, weathered charnockite bedrock that is littered with light-colored quartz-rich, granitic gneiss glacial erratics. The erratics cover the lower slopes of the David Range and Mount Hordern, but are not found more than about 250 metres (820 ft) above the present-day ice surface. Above this level the darker charnockite bedrock is exposed. Probably the boulders were transported from the south and deposited by ice during the last glacial maximum, while the exposed bedrock would have remained above the ice. The East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) formed about 34 million years ago, and seems to have persisted since then with periodic fluctuations in thickness between glacial and inter-glacial cycles. During the last glacial cycle the ice sheet thickened more near the coast, less further incland. This is shown by the upper limit of glacial erratic boulders, ranging from 820 metres (2,690 ft) on Fang Peak near the sea in the north of David Range, to 860 metres (2,820 ft) on Mount Elliot, 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) on Mount Coates and 1,300 metres (4,300 ft) on Mount Hordern, which is about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the sea. The ice surface appears have lowered by several hundred meters during the present interglacial. Today the range has a number of small mountain glaciers. The David and Masson ranges divide the ice flow in the Framnes Mountains into three outlet glacial streams. Ice surface velocities of 21 metres (69 ft) per year have been measured in the ice stream to the east of the David Range, and 31 metres (102 ft) per year in the ice stream to the west. In the period between January and September 1956 ice in the plateau near the range moved up to 36 feet (11 m). The features are listed from north to south. Descriptions are mostly taken from Geographic Names of the Antarctic (1995). 67°47′S 62°35′E﻿ / ﻿67.783°S 62.583°E﻿ / -67.783; 62.583. A prominent pointed peak, 1,120 metres (3,670 ft), standing in the David Range 1 mile (1.6 km) south-southwest of its north extremity. Mapped by Norwegian cartographers from aerial photos taken by the Lan Christensen Expedition in 1936−37. The peak was visited in January 1956 by an ANARE party led by John Bechervaise. Named by ANCA for Neville Parsons. cosmic ray physicist at Mawson Station, 1955. 67°46′32″S 62°34′31″E﻿ / ﻿67.77556°S 62.57528°E﻿ / -67.77556; 62.57528. Fang Peak is about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) south of Mount Parsons and is 1,032 metres (3,386 ft) high. It is a prominent conical peak, named because its shape resembles a tooth. The peak emerges from an unusually clear frozen lake. The slopes of the mountain below the ice surface are visible, as are other mountains that are completely covered by the ice. In 1959 J C Armstrong, surveyor at Mawson Station, used the peak as an unoccupied trigonometrical station. In January 2023 a team from the Mawson Mountaineering Club climbed the peak. 67°49′18″S 62°33′27″E﻿ / ﻿67.82169°S 62.55750°E﻿ / -67.82169; 62.55750. At 1,236 metres (4,055 ft) the mountain is the highest point of the northern ridge of the David Range. Sir Douglas Mawson first saw it from the sea in 1930. It was first climbed in January 1956 by an ANARE party led by J.M. Béchervaise. The peak is named after F.W., Elliott, weather observer at Mawson Station in 1955.

A gap, 3 miles (4.8 km) wide, between Mount Coates and Mount Hordern in the David Range of the Framnes Mountains. Mapped by Norwegian cartographers from aerial photographs taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition, 1936-37. This gap was used by ANARE parties in 1957 and 1958 as a route through the range. Named by ANARE for its proximity to Mount Hordern. The gap was used by an exploration of the route to the Amery Ice Shelf in October 1962 – January 1963, which followed the 1957 route through Hordern Gap and west of Mount Twintop. Near Hordern Gap the tractor train encountered very rough sastrugi. 67°54′S 62°29′E﻿ / ﻿67.900°S 62.483°E﻿ / -67.900; 62.483.
