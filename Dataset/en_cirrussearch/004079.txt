"Don't Cha" is a song written by Busta Rhymes and CeeLo Green, and produced by the latter. The chorus is a slightly modified interpolation of the chorus line sung by Sir Mix-a-Lot in a song he wrote called "Swass" (1988). The song was originally recorded and published in 2004 by Tori Alamaze, former backing vocalist for the hip hop duo OutKast, and was released as her debut single. After minor success, and dissatisfaction with Universal Records, Alamaze gave up her rights to the song. The Pussycat Dolls, an American burlesque dance troupe who were poised to reinvent themselves as a pop music girl group, were offered the song from Universal. The group recorded a new version of "Don't Cha" with raps from Busta Rhymes and released it in 2005 as the lead single from their debut studio album PCD. The Pussycat Dolls' version received positive reviews from music critics, many of whom highlighted it as a standout track from the album; however, some of them criticized Busta Rhymes' appearance. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and atop the Dance Club Songs and Pop 100 charts. Outside the United States, "Don't Cha" topped the charts in 15 countries. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Paul Hunter and featured the group doing various activities, including jumping on a trampoline and drag racing in Jeeps. In January 2004, American recording artist and producer CeeLo Green finished writing and producing "Don't Cha", the chorus of which reprises the hook from "Swass" by Sir Mix-a-Lot, taken from his album of the same name (1988). The song was recorded in a basement studio in Atlanta, Georgia by Tori Alamaze, a former backing vocalist for the hip hop duo OutKast. In November 2004, Alamaze signed a record deal with Green's Radiculture Records and Universal Records, a part of Universal Music Group, and released "Don't Cha" as the lead single from her debut studio album. As the song was gaining momentum, Alamaze grew dissatisfied with Universal Records and, in January 2005, agreed to release her rights to the song in order to get out of her contract as she felt that she "got caught up in the middle of egos and favors." Her debut album, which had already been completed, was shelved. This decision did not help Green oversee Alamaze's career on a major label, but record executives were still interested in "Don't Cha". Alamaze's version of "Don't Cha" received positive reviews from critics. Saptosa Foster of Vibe described it as "sultry", while Salon's Thomas Bartlett commented that the song is "strange, sad and astonishingly good." Stylus Magazine included it on their ranking of the best singles from 2005 at number 30, adding that "at the core, Alamaze remains defiantly sexy over a tight bump-n-grind rhythm." In 2004, choreographer Robin Antin had struck a joint venture with Interscope Records to develop the Pussycat Dolls, a burlesque, cabaret act that was performing in various venues in Hollywood, into a brand. In cooperation with then-chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M Records, Jimmy Iovine and record producer Ron Fair, Antin formed a separate group consisting of six members—Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Nicole Scherzinger, Jessica Sutta, Melody Thornton, and Kimberly Wyatt—based on the burlesque dance revue created by Antin. In order to successfully transition into a major-label, recording act, Fair felt it would be best to deviate from "straight-ahead burlesque" and transition into a more traditional, pop group with contemporary R&B influences. At the suggestion of Doug Morris,—then chairman of Universal Music Group—"Don't Cha" was given to the Pussycat Dolls as the label was trying to reinvent the girl group. They asked Green to rerecord the song with the Pussycat Dolls, who was initially skeptical. "I didn't know too much about them, but when I found out that [Universal-owned] Interscope Records was involved, that was an alliance I didn't hesitate to make." "Don't Cha" was initially offered to both Sugababes and Paris Hilton, but both declined. In 2006, Hilton claimed that she was presented with the track, but was not impressed with it. "I think I did hear the song, but not in the format that we all came to know and love. If I'd heard that, of course I'd have jumped at the chance". "Don't Cha" A sample of the Pussycat Dolls' version of "Don't Cha" from PCD featuring the hook "Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?" "Don't Cha" is an R&B song that lasts four minutes and thirty-two seconds. The song was written by Thomas Callaway, Anthony Ray, and Trevor Smith and produced by Callaway. According to the sheet music published by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, "Don't Cha" was composed using common time in the key of B♭ minor, and set in a moderate hip hop tempo of 120 beats per minute. Naomi West described Busta Rhymes' rap as "garrulous". Speaking of their collaboration, Scherzinger said, "He is so much fun. He's so humble and he just makes you feel good. We are so grateful that [Busta] did it and was a part of it with us. We feel blessed." The song's lyrics are about "taunting a hapless man with the lyrics, "Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me / Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me". The chorus of the song is based on Sir Mix-a-Lot's song "Swass" (1988). Maeve McDermott distinguished "Don't Cha" from other girl group songs like "Wannabe", "Independent Women" and "No Scrubs" which promote female camaraderie. Marisa Meltzer of The Daily Beast felt that the song's lyrics "put forward the belief that a woman's worth lies solely in her appearance and sexual permissiveness and just furthers the notion that women are in competition with one another over men." "Don't Cha" received mainly positive reviews. Sal Cinquemani of described the song as "brassy and sassy" adding that, "the Pussycat Dolls have certainly carved a niche for themselves in 21st century pop history. Stephen Thomas Erlewine also favored the song saying "there has never been a sex song quite as knowingly ironic yet undeniably sexy as this." Writing for musicOMH John Murphy described "Don't Cha" as "a silky, sexy little number that will become ubiquitous by the end of the month." However, he added that Busta Rhymes is annoying. "It's a shame that Busta Rhymes is as typically annoying as ever, but he doesn't spoil the song too much." Spence D. from IGN wrote that the track's "sultry swagger-n-shuffle is the type of stuff that nasty boys and girls might enjoy grinding to." A reviewer from Contactmusic.com gave the song 4 out 5 stars favoring the "serious dose of high energy and raunchy message," while criticized the song for not having "any vocal talent." Lisa Haines from BBC described the track as "memorable". She continued saying "[it's] a groovy R&B duet with Busta Rhymes, is easily the best." Isaac McCalla from About.com praised the song. "This single is a serious dose of high energy, wickedly fun and slammin' house music." Azeem Ahmad also from musicOMH in a separate review commented, "strangely enough 'Don't Cha' isn't purely eye candy." However, he was critical stating: "not even Busta Rhymes' cameo appearance can prevent Don't Cha from seeming like nothing more than a promo for some generic product aimed at young males." Chuck Arnold and Ralph Novak of People magazine wrote that the group is "responsible for [2005's] guiltiest pleasure." The song was nominated for Top Selling Single of the Year at the 2005 Billboard Music Awards. At the 2006 Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Awards the song won the award in the category for Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Sales. At the 21st International Dance Music Awards, the song was nominated in the Best R&B/Urban Dance Track and Best Pop Dance Track categories, winning the former.

"The lyrics are: 'Don't Cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me,' But if you see the video, it's all about being who you are, having fun and being confident — and feeling hot. It's not so much about looking hot ... although looking hot is important." Scherzinger further praised Busta Rhymes for their collaboration on the set of music video, saying ""Busta Rhymes is pretty phat, man. He is so much fun. He's so humble and he just makes you feel good. When you're around him, you feel magical. [...] We are so grateful that [Busta] did it and was a part of it with us."

Billy Johnson Jr. of Yahoo!

They raised the bar." Richard Harrington of The Washington Post described the video as "hot-hot-hot." The Wall Street Journal's Ethan Smith commented that the video "is somewhat less racy than the average hip-hop video." Naomi West of The Telegraph wrote that the video "is no more titillating than any of Jennifer Lopez's or Beyoncé's, and a good deal less than Christina Aguilera's sweat-drenched 'Dirrty' promo." Billboard regarded it as the best music video of the Pussycat Dolls career. In 2005, it won Best Video at the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party. The following year, it earned nominations for Best R&B Video at the 2006 MTV Australia Video Music Awards, Best International Video - Group and People's Choice: Favourite International Group at the 2006 MuchMusic Video Awards, and Best Dance Video at the 21st Annual International Dance Music Awards.

As part of the performance, a TV test card flashed up on screen from ITV reading "we're sorry for the disruption... we're working hard to fix the issue and will return to normal family-friendly, not at all sexy, uncontroversial programming soon." The test card was revealed to be a backdrop which the group jumped through. American singer Colbie Caillat performed "Don't Cha" throughout her US tour in support of her second studio album, Breakthrough (2009). In 2019, Ezra Miller's band, Sons of an Illustrious Father, recorded their own version of "Don't Cha" with the intent to "ridicule and invert" the heterosexual nature of the tune.
