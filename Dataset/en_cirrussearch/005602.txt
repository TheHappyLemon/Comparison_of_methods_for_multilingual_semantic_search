The KHL's Kharlamov Division was formed in 2008 as part of the league's inauguration. It is one of four divisions and part of the Eastern Conference since the second season of the KHL when the conferences were established. It is named in honor of 3x Olympic medalist and Hockey Hall of Fame inductee Valeri Kharlamov. The Kharlamov Division is made up of the following teams: Ak Bars Kazan Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg HC Lada Togliatti Metallurg Magnitogorsk Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod Traktor Chelyabinsk In the first KHL season, the division alignment was determined by team strength and the Kharlamov Division consisted of: Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, Amur Khabarovsk, Avangard Omsk, Dinamo Riga, Lada Togliatti and Sibir Novosibirsk. With the geographical alignment of the divisions for the 2009–10 season, the composition of the Kharlamov Division was completely changed. Only Lada Togliatti remained and was joined by Ak Bars Kazan, Metallurg Magnitogorsk, Traktor Chelyabinsk, Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk and Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg. After Lada Togliatti had to withdraw from the KHL in 2010, they were replaced by Yugra Khanty-Mansiysk from Khanty-Mansiysk. With the addition of two teams in 2013, Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod moved from the Tarasov Division to this division in order to balance out the two conferences. Lada Togliatti returned to the league after a four-year absence and Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod has been moved back to the Tarasov Division. Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod returns to the division, though Yugra Khanty-Mansiysk and Lada Togliatti leave the division and league altogether due to poor performance; they join the VHL. Sibir Novosibirsk returns to the division after 11 years in the Chernyshev Division, and Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod returns to Tarasov Division and the Western Conference altogether. Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod returns to the division a third time from the Bobrov Division. Sibir Novosibirsk leaves the division and returns to the Chernyshev Division. 2021: Ak Bars Kazan (90 points) 2020: Ak Bars Kazan (93 points) 2019: Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg (95 points) 2018: Ak Bars Kazan (100 points) 2017: Metallurg Magnitogorsk (124 points) 2016: Metallurg Magnitogorsk (103 points) 2015: Ak Bars Kazan (120 points) 2014: Metallurg Magnitogorsk (108 points) 2013: Ak Bars Kazan (104 points) 2012: Traktor Chelyabinsk (114 points – Continental Cup winner) 2011: Ak Bars Kazan (105 points) 2010: Metallurg Magnitogorsk (115 points) 2009: Lokomotiv Yaroslavl (111 points) 2018: Ak Bars Kazan 2016: Metallurg Magnitogorsk 2014: Metallurg Magnitogorsk 2010: Ak Bars Kazan
