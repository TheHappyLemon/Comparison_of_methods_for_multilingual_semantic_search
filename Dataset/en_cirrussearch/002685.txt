Recz [rɛt͡ʂ] (German: Reetz) is a town in Choszczno County, West Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland, with a population of 2,963 as of 2010. The settlement dates back to the Early Middle Ages, and in the 10th century it became part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I. Recz was first mentioned in 1269. In the late 13th century a Cistercian nunnery was founded. In 1373 Recz became part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (or Czech Lands), ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with Poland in Kraków. Poland was to buy and re-incorporate Recz and its surroundings, but eventually the Luxembourgs sold the town to the Teutonic Order, whose rule lasted until 1454. During the Polish-Swedish War, in 1657 the town was captured by Poles. From the 18th century it was part of the Kingdom of Prussia and subsequently in 1871 it became part of Germany. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, it became again part of Poland. Recz is located on the intersection of the national road 10 and voivodeship road 151. There is also a railway station in the town.
