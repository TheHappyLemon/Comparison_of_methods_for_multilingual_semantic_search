Mosley Music Group (MMG) is a record label founded and formed by producer Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley in 2006. A successor to his previous label Beat Club, it has operated as an imprint of Def Jam Recordings since 2019. Previously, the label operated an imprint of Interscope Records (2006–2014) and Epic Records (2014–2019). The label was created after Timbaland's former label, Beat Club, folded. The first album release from MMG, Nelly Furtado's Loose, went on to be certified platinum. The label's second release was Timbaland's own second album Shock Value. MMG's third release was OneRepublic's debut album Dreaming Out Loud on November 20, 2007, from which the single "Apologize" hit #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. The week ending November 10, 2007, "Apologize" was the biggest radio airplay hit in the history of Top 40 radio in North America, racking up an astounding 10,331 spins beating the previous record held by Nelly Furtado's hit "Promiscuous". In February 2008 SoundScan data reported that "Apologize" was one of only two songs in history to sell 3 million digital downloads. After nearly ten years with Interscope Records, Timbaland moved distribution to Epic Records in November 2014. The move to the new label was due to his involvement in the success of Michael Jackson's second posthumous album Xscape. Most of the artists signed to Mosley Music Group will have their future recordings handled by Epic with the exception of OneRepublic, who will remain at Interscope.
