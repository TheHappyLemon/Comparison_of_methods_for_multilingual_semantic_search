Group H of the 2010 FIFA World Cup began on 16 June and ended on 25 June 2010. The group consisted of Switzerland, Honduras, Chile and reigning European champions Spain. Spain would eventually win the tournament. Chile and Spain were in the same group in 1950, in a group from which only the Spanish team qualified for the next round. Chile and Switzerland were also in the same group in 1962, when Chile was host and went on to finish in third place. Switzerland and Spain competed in the same group in 1966, but neither advanced to the next round. Finally, Honduras and Spain were in the same group in 1982. Four years later, in the next World Cup, Chile and Spain would meet again in Group B, against the Netherlands and Australia; Chile would upset Spain 2–0 in their second match, eliminating Spain from the tournament.
