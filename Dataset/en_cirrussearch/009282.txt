The newton (symbol: N) is the unit of force in the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as 1 kg⋅m/s2{\displaystyle 1\ {\text{kg}}\cdot {\text{m/s}}^{2}}, the force which gives a mass of 1 kilogram an acceleration of 1 metre per second squared. It is named after Isaac Newton in recognition of his work on classical mechanics, specifically his second law of motion. A newton is defined as 1 kg⋅m/s2{\displaystyle \mathrm {1\ kg{\cdot }m/s^{2}} } (it is a named derived unit defined in terms of the SI base units).: 137  One newton is, therefore, the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one metre per second squared in the direction of the applied force. The units "metre per second squared" can be understood as measuring a rate of change in velocity per unit of time, i.e. an increase in velocity by 1 metre per second every second. In 1946, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) Resolution 2 standardized the unit of force in the MKS system of units to be the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 metre per second squared. In 1948, the 9th CGPM Resolution 7 adopted the name newton for this force. The MKS system then became the blueprint for today's SI system of units. The newton thus became the standard unit of force in the Système international d'unités (SI), or International System of Units. The newton is named after Isaac Newton. As with every SI unit named for a person, its symbol starts with an upper case letter (N), but when written in full, it follows the rules for capitalisation of a common noun; i.e., newton becomes capitalised at the beginning of a sentence and in titles but is otherwise in lower case. The connection to Newton comes from Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force exerted on an object is directly proportional to the acceleration hence acquired by that object, thus: F=ma,{\displaystyle F=ma,} where m{\displaystyle m} represents the mass of the object undergoing an acceleration a{\displaystyle a}. When using the SI unit of mass, the kilogram (kg{\displaystyle {\text{kg}}}), and SI units for distance metre (m{\displaystyle {\text{m}}}), and time, second (s{\displaystyle {\text{s}}}) we arrive at the SI definition of the newton: 1 kg⋅m/s2.{\displaystyle \mathrm {1\ kg{\cdot }m/s^{2}} .} At average gravity on Earth (conventionally, g=9.80665 m/s2{\displaystyle g={9.80665}\ {\text{m/s}}^{2}}), a kilogram mass exerts a force of about 9.8 newtons. An average-sized apple at 200 g exerts about two newtons of force at Earth's surface, which we measure as the apple's weight on Earth. 0.200 kg×9.80665 m/s2=1.961 N.{\displaystyle 0.200{\text{ kg}}\times 9.80665{\text{ m/s}}^{2}=1.961{\text{ N}}.} An average adult exerts a force of about 608 N on Earth. 62 kg×9.80665 m/s2=608 N{\displaystyle 62{\text{ kg}}\times 9.80665{\text{ m/s}}^{2}=608{\text{ N}}} (where 62 kg is the world average adult mass). Large forces may be expressed in kilonewtons (kN), where 1 kN = 1000 N. For example, the tractive effort of a Class Y steam train locomotive and the thrust of an F100 jet engine are both around 130 kN. One kilonewton, 1 kN, is equivalent to 102.0 kgf, or about 100 kg of load under Earth gravity. 1 kN=102 kg×9.81 m/s2{\displaystyle 1{\text{ kN}}=102{\text{ kg}}\times 9.81{\text{ m/s}}^{2}}. So, for example, a platform that shows it is rated at 321 kilonewtons (72,000 lbf) will safely support a 32,100-kilogram (70,800 lb) load.[citation needed] Force gauge International System of Units (SI) Joule, SI unit of energy, 1 newton exerted over a distance of 1 metre Kilogram-force, force exerted by Earth's gravity at sea level on one kilogram of mass Kip (unit) Pascal, SI unit of pressure, 1 newton acting on an area of 1 square metre Orders of magnitude (force) Pound (force) Sthène Newton metre, SI unit of torque Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (2019).
