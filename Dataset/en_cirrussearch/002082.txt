Ob' Bay (70°35′S 163°22′E﻿ / ﻿70.583°S 163.367°E﻿ / -70.583; 163.367) is a bay lying between Lunik Point and Cape Williams in Antarctica. Lillie Glacier Tongue occupies the east part of the bay. The bay was charted by the Soviet Antarctic Expedition (1958) and named after the expedition ship Ob'. Ob' Bay is on the Pacific Ocean to the east of the Explorers Range of the Bowers Mountains. It is northwest of the Anare Mountains The bay stretches between Lunik Point below Mount Dergach in the west and Cape Williams in the east. Astapenko Glacier enters the bay to the south of Mount Dergach, and is joined at its point of entry by Chugunov Glacier and Astakhov Glacier to the east. Further east, past Platypus Ridge, Lillie Glacier enters the bay, with Lillie Glacier Tongue extending into the bay. The Sputnik Islands are in the entrance to the bay. Sailing Directions for Antarctica (1943) says "Lillie Glacier Tongue extends northward from snow-covered rounded hills between Cape Cheetham and Williams Head for a distance of about 20 miles, and is about 125 feet (38.1 m.) high. A sounding of 134 fathoms (245.1 m.) has been plotted about 4 miles northward of the Tongue. Many grounded icebergs and unbroken fast ice fringe the shore, and a strong northwestward current sets along the coast." Named features, from west to east, include: 70°26′S 162°45′E﻿ / ﻿70.433°S 162.750°E﻿ / -70.433; 162.750.
