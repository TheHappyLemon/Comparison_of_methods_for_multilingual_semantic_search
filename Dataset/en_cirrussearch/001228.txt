Rennick Glacier (70°30′S 160°45′E﻿ / ﻿70.500°S 160.750°E﻿ / -70.500; 160.750) is broad glacier, nearly 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) long, which is one of the largest in Antarctica. It rises on the polar plateau westward of Mesa Range and is 20 to 30 nautical miles (37 to 56 km; 23 to 35 mi) wide, narrowing to 10 nautical miles (19 km; 12 mi) near the coast. It takes its name from Rennick Bay where the glacier reaches the sea. The seaward part of the glacier was photographed by United States Navy Operation Highjump, 1946–47. The upper reaches of the Rennick Glacier were discovered and explored by the U.S. Victoria Land Traverse (VLT) in February 1960, and the first ascent made of Welcome Mountain by John Weihaupt, Alfred Stuart, Claude Lorius and Arnold Heine of the VLT party.[citation needed] On February 10, 1960, Lieutenant Commander Robert L. Dale, pilot of U.S. Navy (USN) Squadron VX-6, evacuated the VLT from 72°38′S 161°32′E﻿ / ﻿72.633°S 161.533°E﻿ / -72.633; 161.533, on this glacier, and then conducted an aerial photographic reconnaissance to Rennick Bay on the coast before returning the VLT team to McMurdo Station. The Rennick Glacier rises to the east of the Tobin Mesa in the Mesa Range, north of the Vantage Hills and Illusion Hills, and east of the Lichen Hills and Lemasters Bluff. It flows north past the Pain Mesa to its east and Sheehan Mesa to its west. The glacier continues north past the Monument Nunataks to its west and Freyberg Mountains to its east. The Outback Nunataks are to the west of its upper section. The Rennick Glacier flows north past the Alamein Range to its east, where it is joined by the Canham Glacier. It passes the Onlooker Nunatak and Morozumi Range to its west, and is joined by the Hunter Glacier from the Lanterman Range to the east, just after Linder Glacier has joined Hunter Glacier. North of that it receives Orr Glacier from the east just north of the Tenterhooks Crevasses. Further north the Rennick Glacier receives Sledgers Glacier, Carryer Glacier and Alt Glacier from the Explorers Range to the east. Sledgers Glacier tributaries include Tobogganers Icefall and MacKinnon Glacier, which enters at Sledgers Icefall. Carryer Glacier tributaries include Morley Glacier. To the north of Morozumi Range the Rennick Glacier is joined from the west by the wide Gressit Glacier. At its mouth the Rennick Glacier receives ice from the Lovejoy Glacier and Harlin Glacier, which flow east through the Charybdis Icefalls. It is joined from the west by the small Serrat Glacier just before entering Rennick Bay. Tributaries from the Explorers Range to the east include Sheehan Glacier, Alvarez Glacier and Arruiz Glacier. Many of the features and tributary glaciers were mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-64. Features, from south to north, include 73°10′S 160°20′E﻿ / ﻿73.167°S 160.333°E﻿ / -73.167; 160.333. The névé at the head of Rennick Glacier in Victoria Land.
