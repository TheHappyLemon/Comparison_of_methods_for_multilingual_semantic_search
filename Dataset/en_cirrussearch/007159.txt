.kp is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for North Korea (DPRK). It was created on 24 September 2007. The DPRK applied for the .kp Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) in 2004. ICANN, however, refused because the DPRK did not meet some of the requirements.[specify] Another attempt was later made via the Korea Computer Center (KCC) Europe in 2006. The main body of KCC and the DPRK Ambassador to the United Nations petitioned ICANN again. They were refused again for providing insufficient information. A new application was sent in January 2007, and an ICANN delegation visited the country in May. This time, ICANN finally agreed to assign .kp to the DPRK. One of the first organizations to adopt a .kp domain was the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in 2009. Previously, the .kp domain was managed by the Korea Computer Center (KCC) Europe. A large number of .kp websites were also hosted by KCC Europe in Germany. However, in 2011, management was transferred to the Pyongyang-based Star Joint Venture. Neither the DPRK government agencies nor the central registry have published the second-level domain registration rules. However, according to the using practices shown by the currently existing and accessible DPRK domains and websites, while regarding the worldwide country code second-level domain distribution rules, the second-level domain rules in the DPRK can be interpreted as below. ac.kp : Academy institutes aca.kp : Academic and research institutes co.kp  : Generally commercial organizations com.kp : Generally commercial organizations and sometimes government information agencies as well con.kp : Construction edu.kp : Institutions of higher education law.kp : Legal firms hia.kp : inf.kp : Information sites org.kp : Industrial associations, civil organizations, and public funds gov.kp : Government departments ref.kp : Reference works rep.kp : Information agencies of the Workers' Party of Korea roi.kp : net.kp : Internet service providers and email service providers sca.kp : Affiliated institutes under the Ministry of Culture (cf.
