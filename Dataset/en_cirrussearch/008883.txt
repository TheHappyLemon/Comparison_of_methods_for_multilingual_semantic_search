Obtest is an extreme metal band from Vilnius, Lithuania. They started out in 1992 as a brutal death metal act, but soon changed the style to black metal. Their lyrics are related to Lithuanian mythology and are sung in Lithuanian, though a few of the songs on their demos were in English. The band currently refers their music style as "heathen war heavy metal."[citation needed] Sadlave - guitar (also in Notanga, ex-Burying Place, Fanarai, ex-Anubi, Agyria, Trolis & The Giberlingers, ex-Ruination) Baalberith - vocals Karolis - bass Insmuth - drums Enrikas Slavinskis - guitars (ex-Fata Morgana (Ltu), ex-Stone's Lament, Soul Stealer, Loosers, Crossroad, Degradatonia) Demonas - bass (also in Burying Place, ex-Zalvarinis) Oldness Coming (Demo, 1995) - the title is misspelled "Comming" on the album cover.
