Maybe I'm Dreaming is the debut studio album by American electronica project Owl City, released on March 17, 2008. Despite having been self-released and not recorded by any major producer, it managed to reach the top 20 of the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart. Following the surprise success of Owl City's second album, Ocean Eyes, Maybe I'm Dreaming was pressed and re-released by Universal Republic on March 30, 2010. Maybe I'm Dreaming was recorded in February 2008, in the basement of Adam Young's childhood home. Guest musicians on the album include Breanne Düren and Austin Tofte. Düren is featured on multiple songs on the album, most notably on the track, "The Saltwater Room". A friend had suggested that she would be perfect to work with Young. Young revealed that he used his uncle's 1969 Alvarez guitar on the fourth track, "The Saltwater Room". The seventh track, "The Technicolor Phase", is featured on Alice in Wonderland's compilation album, Almost Alice. An official music video for the song "Early Birdie" was filmed in March 2008 by Adam Young's childhood friends/bandmates Andy and Anthony Johnson of Windsor Airlift, and then released on January 13, 2011, via YouTube. Maybe I'm Dreaming was met with positive reviews from music critics. Anthony Tognazzini of AllMusic praised the album for its "breezy melodies, personal lyrics, and carefully orchestrated folktronica." He also complimented Young's ability to build on "the skills he was developing on Of June" and turn it into a "strong effort" on the album. Kaj Roth of Melodic stated, "If you're in the mood for ambient music, then Maybe I'm Dreaming is surely the right medicine." Will R of Sputnikmusic stated that the album, "soothes the listener with airy, almost ethereal leads and simple acoustic guitar strums over a relaxing bed of synth pads." He also called "Rainbow Veins" the "standout track on the album," praising the synth lead and rhythmic guitar. He also complimented the songs, "The Technicolor Phase" for its melody, and "West Coast Friendship" for its, "chilled-out synths." All tracks are written by Adam Young "On the Wing" and "The Saltwater Room" were included as remastered tracks on the band's second studio album Ocean Eyes.
