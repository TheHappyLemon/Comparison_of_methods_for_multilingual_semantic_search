Mount Bird (77°17′S 166°43′E﻿ / ﻿77.283°S 166.717°E﻿ / -77.283; 166.717﻿ (Mount Bird)) is a 1,765 metres (5,791 ft) high shield volcano standing about 7 nautical miles (13 km; 8.1 mi) south of Cape Bird, the northern extremity of Ross Island. It was mapped by the British National Antarctic Expedition, 1901–04, under Robert Falcon Scott, and apparently named by them after Cape Bird. Mount Bird was originally a separate island, which through volcanic activity has become a rounded peninsula on the northwestern tip of Ross Island. At its southernmost point, where it is connected with the rest of the island by a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) wide isthmus, a 500-metre (1,600 ft) high pass, Bird Pass, separates the bulk of Mount Bird from the northern slopes of Mount Erebus. The peninsula is flanked to the west and east by two large and frequently ice-bound bays, Wohlschlag Bay in the west and Lewis Bay in the east. Mount Bird is a basaltic shield volcano that was active from 4.6 to 3.8 million years ago. On the flanks of the volcano there are poorly exposed basalt scoria cones, and phonolite domes and flows. The coastal cliffs display the shield's thick stack of basalt lava flows. Several glaciers or meltwater streams flow from the mountain to the sea. 77°16′S 166°21′E﻿ / ﻿77.267°S 166.350°E﻿ / -77.267; 166.350. A stream between Fitzgerald Hill and Inclusion Hill on the lower ice-free west slopes of Mount Bird, flowing to McMurdo Sound across McDonald Beach.
