The Lakers, the Rockets, the Warriors and the SuperSonics all joined from the Western Division. The Lakers have won the most Pacific Division titles with 24. The Phoenix Suns have the second most titles with eight. 19 NBA champions have come from the Pacific Division.

In the 1977–78 season, all teams in the division had winning percentages above 0.500 (50%). The most recent division champions are the Sacramento Kings.
