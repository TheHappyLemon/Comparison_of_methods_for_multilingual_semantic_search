The Aveyron (French pronunciation: [aveʁɔ̃] ; Occitan: Avairon) is a 291 km long river in southern France, right tributary of the Tarn. It rises in the southern Massif Central, near Sévérac-le-Château. In 1855 evidence of prehistoric man was found near Bruniquel under a hill called Montastruc. The hill was 98 foot high. The account said the overhang extended for about 46 feet along the river and the area enclosed was 298 square yards. Within this cave was found the 13,000-year-old sculpture called Swimming Reindeer.
