Oropendolas are a genus of passerine birds, Psarocolius, in the New World blackbird family Icteridae. They were formerly split among two or three different genera and are found in Central and South America. All the oropendolas are large birds with pointed bills, and long tails which are always at least partially bright yellow. Males are usually larger than females. The plumage is typically chestnut, dark brown or black, although the Green oropendola and olive oropendola have, as their names imply, an olive coloration to the head, breast and upper back. The legs are dark, but the bill is usually a strikingly contrasting feature, either pale yellow, or red-tipped with a green or black base. In several species there is also a blue or pink bare cheek patch. Oropendolas are birds associated with forests or, for a few species, more open woodland. They are colonial breeders, with several long woven basket nests in a tree, each hanging from the end of a branch. These gregarious birds eat large insects and fruit. They are very vocal, producing a wide range of songs and calls, sometimes including mimicry. The following species are recognised in the genus Psarocolius: Black oropendola (Psarocolius guatimozinus) Chestnut-headed oropendola (Psarocolius wagleri) Russet-backed oropendola (Psarocolius angustifrons) Dusky-green oropendola (Psarocolius atrovirens) Green oropendola (Psarocolius viridis) Crested oropendola (Psarocolius decumanus) Four species of oropendola were formerly classified within the genus Gymnostinops; alternatively, the crested oropendola (and possibly others) would have also been placed here (Price & Lanyon 2002): Montezuma oropendola (Psarocolius montezuma) Baudo oropendola (Psarocolius cassini) Olive oropendola (Psarocolius bifasciatus) Price & Lanyon (2002) used mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data to research oropendola phylogeny. As can be observed from morphology, the band-tailed (Ocyalus latirostris) and the casqued oropendolas (Psarocolius oseryi) are the most distinct species. Genetically, they appear to be more closely related to the caciques, and both species would be classified in the genus Ocyalus. Furthermore, the casqued oropendola could be separated into Clypicterus, forming what would then become a monotypic genus (like Ocyalus). "Icteridae". aviansystematics.org.
