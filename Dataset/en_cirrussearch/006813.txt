The 1984 NHL Entry Draft was the 22nd NHL Entry Draft. It took place on June 9, 1984, at the Montreal Forum in Montreal, Quebec. The 1984 Entry Draft is noted for the unusually high number of future Hall of Famers picked, particularly in lower rounds. In addition to Mario Lemieux being taken first overall, Patrick Roy was chosen in the third round, Brett Hull in the sixth, and Luc Robitaille in the ninth. In addition, Lemieux, Gary Suter and Robitaille would all go on to win the Calder Memorial Trophy, Lemieux in 1985, Suter in 1986, and Robitaille in 1987, making this a rare draft in which multiple Rookie of the Year winners were produced. The surprise at the time of the draft was Montreal's selection of Petr Svoboda at fifth-overall. As a player trained behind the Iron Curtain, very few people expected him to be available for selection in the draft, let alone be actually attending the draft and coming to the podium when his name was announced, as he had only recently defected to West Germany following the 1984 WJHC (only Serge Savard, the then-GM of the Canadiens, had been aware of Svoboda's defection). In addition to Svoboda, of note is that Tom Glavine, playing centre in high school, who later became a star Major League Baseball pitcher with more than 300 career wins, as well as a 2014 inductee of the Baseball Hall of Fame was chosen in the fourth round (69th overall) by the Los Angeles Kings, ahead of notable players such as future Hall of Famers Brett Hull (117th overall), and Luc Robitaille (171st overall). The Montreal Canadiens, with their last pick, drafted Troy Crosby, the father of Sidney Crosby. The last active player in the NHL from this draft class was Gary Roberts, who retired after the 2008–09 season. Below are listed the selections in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft.
