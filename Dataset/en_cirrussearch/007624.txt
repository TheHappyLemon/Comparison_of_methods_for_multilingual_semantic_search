Camelinae is a subfamily of artiodactyls of the family Camelidae. Camelinae include the tribes Camelini and Lamini. A third tribe, Camelopini, created by S. D. Webb (1965), was formerly included, but was discarded by J. A. Harrison (1979) after it was shown to be polyphyletic: it consisted of the genera Camelops and Megatylopus, which were moved to Camelini and Lamini respectively. Camelinae was named by Gray (1821). Its type is Camelus. It was assigned to Camelidae by Stanley et al. (1994) and Ruez (2005). Harrison, J. A (1979).
