The first time Puszczykowo name appears in written sources in the form of Posczucowo was in 1387, although Niwka, a settlement within the town limits was mentioned as early as 1302. Residential buildings, characteristic of present-day town date from the close of the 19th century. The railway line leading to Wroclaw and station building were built in 1856. In the Interwar period the excursion traffic on Sundays and holidays was so great that trains from Poznań ran every 10 minutes. To avoid interference with the long-distance traffic an additional track had to be built for them. Also popular were steamboat trips.
