Wood Bay (74°13′S 165°30′E﻿ / ﻿74.217°S 165.500°E﻿ / -74.217; 165.500) is a large bay which is bounded by Cape Johnson and Aviator Glacier Tongue on the north, and Cape Washington on the south, along the coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica. It was discovered in 1841 by Captain James Clark Ross, Royal Navy, and named by him for Lieutenant James F.L. Wood of the ship HMS Erebus. Wood Bay is on the west coast of the Ross Sea. It is delimited to the north by Hayes Head on Cape Johnson. The Aviator Glacier Tongue extends into the sea between Wood Bay and Lady Newnes Bay to the north. The Tinker Glacier Tongue extends into the bay to the east of Cape Johnson and Kay Island, and to the west of Harrow Peaks in the Random Hills. Further south is Edmonson Point, where there is an Adélie penguin rookery, Willows Nunatak and Cape Washington, which delimited the south end of the bay. Mount Melbourne dominates the southern part of the bay. Named features of the bay, from north to south, include: 74°01′S 165°17′E﻿ / ﻿74.017°S 165.283°E﻿ / -74.017; 165.283.
