A team sport is a type of sport where the fundamental nature of the game or sport necessitates the participation of multiple individuals working together as a team, and it is inherently impossible or highly impractical to execute the sport as a single-player endeavour. In team sports, the cooperative effort of team members is essential for the sport to function and achieve its objectives. The objective often involves teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points. Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football, and hockey. These sports emphasize teamwork, strategy, and coordination among team members, while competing against opposing teams, to achieve a common goal. Team sports do not include individual or individual-to-team events within a sport. The meaning of a "team sport" has been disputed in recent years. Some types of sports have different objectives or rules than "traditional" team sports. These types of team sports do not involve teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points. Overall, the division into team sports and individual sports is not always unproblematic, since there are different combinations in the individual sports. Pure team sports This includes sports that can only be practiced as a team sport. The number of team members is fixed for the team. In order to compete successfully in championships and tournaments, teams need a roster that is significantly larger than the number of players starting the game. Players may be substituted from a squad in competition matches to replace exhausted or injured players or to make tactical changes. Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football, and hockey. Teams of two people are sports, such as dancesport or beach volleyball. No substitute players are used here. The two partners are absolutely dependent on each other. The absence of a person here means the loss of competitiveness. Formations In addition, there are sports, while mostly played singles, that are also played in different formations together cooperatively, such as badminton, table tennis or tennis in doubles, although this formation is significantly lower in terms of prestige, spectators and prize money. In these formations, common tactics, teamwork and agreements are crucial for success. There are also different rowing formations such as one, two, four and eight or sailing with their different boat classes. The most important thing here is smooth movements and common tactics. This also applies approximately to the team time trial in cycling, while it is the case with cycling tours and one-day races are different tasks for the team members of a cycling team. Relays In some sports, relay races are held, which can be distinguished from pure team evaluations by a common racing tactic and the observance of change regulations. Relay races are common in running, swimming, cross-country skiing, biathlon or short-track speed skating and are also an integral part in the Olympic Games program with high popularity. Team ratings There are team ratings in many sports, in which the results of individual athletes or formations are added up. In cycling team members, whilst still in competition with each other, will also work towards assisting one member of the team, usually a specialist, to the highest possible finishing position. In some sports where participants are entered by a team, they do not only compete against members of other teams, but also against each other for points towards championship standings, for example in motorsport, particularly Formula One. Team orders can occur in such teams and although previously accepted was banned in Formula One between 2002 and 2010. After a controversy involving team orders at the 2010 German Grand Prix however, the regulation was removed as of the 2011 season. In summary, team sports are characterized by the impossibility or impracticality of executing the sport as a single-player endeavor, and the entire game or match relies on team dynamics. In contrast, sports with team ratings and formations involve both individual and team aspects, where individual performances contribute to a team's overall success but may not be entirely reliant on team dynamics. Relay races combine individual efforts within a team context, where smooth transitions are essential. Areas around the Mediterranean had a long tradition of athletic events. Ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians depicted athletic scenes in tombs of kings and their nobles. They did not, however, hold regular competitions, and those events that occurred were probably the preserve of kings and upper classes. Minoans culture held gymnastics in high esteem, with bull-leaping, tumbling, running, wrestling and boxing shown on their frescoes. The Mycenaeans adopted Minoan games and also raced chariots in religious or funerary ceremonies. Homer's heroes participate in athletic competitions to honor the dead. In the Iliad there are chariot races, boxing, wrestling, a foot race, as well as fencing, archery, and spear throwing. The Odyssey adds to these a long jump and discus throw. It was in Greece that sports were first instituted formally, with the first Olympic Games recorded in 776 BCE in Olympia, where they were celebrated until 393 CE. These ancient Olympic Games consisted of running, long jump, boxing, wrestling, Pankration (combat sport), discus throw, and javelin throw. In the Bayankhongor Province of Mongolia, Neolithic-era cave paintings dating to 7000 BC depict a wrestling match surrounded by crowds. Prehistoric cave-paintings in Japan show a sport similar to sumo wrestling. In Wadi Sura, near Gilf Kebir in Libya, a Neolithic rock painting in the cave of swimmers shows evidence of swimming and archery being practiced around 6000 BC. Team sports have a rich and ancient history dating back thousands of years. These activities served as important facets of society, not only for physical fitness but also for social, cultural, and even political purposes. In ancient civilizations, team sports were prevalent and often intertwined with religious and cultural practices. In Mesoamerica, the Aztec ball game, ollamaliztli, was not just a sport but also a ritual with symbolic significance. The Greeks, who laid the foundations for many contemporary sports, held various team sports as central to their culture. The Olympic Games, first recorded in 776 BCE, featured events like chariot racing and team foot races, fostering unity and friendly competition among city-states. The Spartans, known for their military prowess, engaged in team sports like the episkyros, a type of football. Rome adopted and adapted many Greek sports, introducing harpastum, a ball game similar to soccer, and ludi circenses, which included team chariot racing. These sports provided a sense of entertainment and unity, while also serving as a means of social control. In ancient China, cuju was a popular team sport akin to modern soccer, played as early as the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). The sport was not only a form of entertainment but also a means of fostering camaraderie among communities. Throughout history, team sports have reflected the values and priorities of their respective cultures. Whether it was the competitive spirit of the Greeks, the discipline of the Romans, or the communal bonding in China, ancient team sports played an integral role in the social fabric of civilizations. They transcended mere physical activity, serving as a testament to the enduring significance of sports in human history. Today, these ancient traditions continue to influence modern team sports, reminding us of the timeless appeal and cultural importance of collective athletic endeavors. status after the 2022 Winter Olympics Summer Olympics (14) Notes Olympic Games 2028: Baseball/softball, cricket (T20), flag football and lacrosse (sixes) as team sports have been officially included as additional sports on the programme for the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028 (LA28), but are not part of the next 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris Winter Olympics (2) Ice hockey and curling are team sports at the Winter Olympics, with particularity that the men's tournament in Ice hockey was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics and was transferred permanently to the Winter Olympic Games program in 1924, in France.
