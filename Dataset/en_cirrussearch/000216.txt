FIBA Oceania is a zone within FIBA (International Basketball Federation). It is one of FIBA's five continental confederations. FIBA Oceania is responsible for the organization and governance of the major international tournaments in Oceania. It has 22 FIBA Federations and is headquartered in Southport, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The current FIBA Oceania President is David Reid from Australia. Its prime events were the FIBA Oceania Championship for men and the FIBA Oceania Women's Championship. The men's championship, established in 1971, was dominated by Australia. Yet, on some occasions, New Zealand defeated its rival, which was first accomplished in 1978. Australia was even more dominant in the women's tournament, first held in 1974; the Opals won all but one of its editions, with New Zealand winning only the 1993 edition. Both Oceania Championships held their last editions in 2015. Since then, FIBA Oceania and FIBA Asia national teams compete for a single championship for each sexâ€”the men's FIBA Asia Cup and the FIBA Women's Asia Cup. FIBA Oceania was founded by Al Ramsey in 1967. Known as the Oceania Basketball Confederation at the time, FIBA Oceania was recognized as a FIBA zone in 1968 during the FIBA Congress in Mexico City.
