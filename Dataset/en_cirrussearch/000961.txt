Eisbrecher (German for 'icebreaker'; pronounced [ˈaɪsbʁɛçɐ]) is a German Neue Deutsche Härte band that consists primarily of Alexander Wesselsky (vocals) and Rupert Keplinger (bass), with live support from Jürgen Plangger (rhythm guitar), Marc "Micki" Richter (lead guitar), and Achim Färber (drums). In the United States and Canada, their record label is currently Metropolis Records. The band's lyrics and slogans often include terms of ice and sailing, such as "Ahoi" ("Ahoy") and "Es wird kalt" ("It's getting cold"); vocalist Alexander Wesselsky often wears naval and military clothing in performances. After leaving Megaherz in 2003 due to creative differences, Wesselsky got together with Noel Pix, who composed the synths, guitars and programming for Megaherz's albums Kopfschuss and Himmelfahrt. In January 2004, the band released their self-titled debut album, Eisbrecher. The first 5,000 copies of the album included a blank CD with permission for purchasers to legally copy the music onto the blank. This was done as a protest against what the band felt was a "criminalization" of fans. The band would release their second album Antikörper in October 2006. This album would become the band's debut album on the German Media Control Charts as it charted at No. 85. The band then toured with U.D.O. in December 2006. In 2007, Eisbrecher performed at two major German music festivals, Wave-Gotik-Treffen and Summer Breeze Open Air. In May 2008, live bass player Martin Motnik left the band, and was replaced by former Megaherz guitar player Olliver Pohl. "Kann denn Liebe Sünde sein?" was released on 18 July 2008 in Germany as the first single to promote their third album, Sünde. It reached third place in the German Alternative charts. The album was released on 22 August 2008 in Germany and debuted on the Media Control Charts at 18th place. The band then went a tour between September 2008 and October 2009, playing in Germany, Austria, Russia, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Music videos were planned for "This Is Deutsch" and "Kann denn Liebe Sünde sein", but were cancelled in favor of new material and live shows. In early March 2009, the band signed with a new American music label, Metropolis Records, due to Dancing Ferret Discs closing in late 2008. On 24 April 2009, Wesselsky and Noel Pix were guests on Radio Goethe to promote the American release of Sünde. Wesselsky mentioned that he would love to tour the United States "as soon as possible". He also mentioned that, with the popularity of Rammstein, Nena and Falco, he hopes that Eisbrecher can become the next big German act in the United States. He also talked about their upcoming fourth album; no title was named, but he stated that work was in progress. He described that the new album will be "very rockish, very pop and very heart breaking." On 20 June 2009, Eisbrecher performed at their first major Austrian music festival, Nova Rock Festival; other bands, such as Killswitch Engage, Monster Magnet and In Extremo also performed on the same stage. Eisbrecher's fourth studio album, Eiszeit, was released in mid-April 2010. The single "Eiszeit" was released on 19 March 2010 and became their debut single in the Media Control Charts, at No. 84. The album was released on 16 April 2010 and debuted in the Media Control Charts at No. 5, the Ö3 Austria Top 40 charts at No. 34, and the Swiss Music Charts at No. 76. In August 2010, it was reported that Eisbrecher had signed with Sony Records and Columbia Records. After the Summer Breeze Open Air festival, bassist Olli Pohl left the band. The band later found a new bass guitar player in Dominik Palmer. In November 2010, Eisbrecher toured with Alice Cooper and Tarja Turunen during Cooper's "Theatre of Death Tour" of Germany. Eisbrecher's drummer Rene Greil was temporarily replaced during the tour by Sebastian Angrand, as Greil needed back surgery. On 26 February 2011, it was announced in the Herzeleid.com forums that live drummer Rene Greil had left Eisbrecher due to health reasons. Greil was replaced by Achim Färber. Announced on 31 March 2011, it was reported that Eisbrecher will release a best of album titled Eiskalt due for release on 29 April 2011. However, Alexander Wesselsky stated that the album was made without the band's knowledge and that they did not choose any of the songs to appear on the compilation. Eisbrecher appeared at the Nova Rock Festival in Austria on 11 June 2011, the same day Thirty Seconds to Mars, HammerFall, In Extremo and Linkin Park performed. During the Zugspitze concert on 5 November 2011, Eisbrecher performed six new songs from their upcoming album titled Die Hölle muss warten. The first single from the album, "Verrückt", was released on 20 January 2012. The album was released on 3 February 2012 and charted in Germany at No. 3, in Austria at No. 21, and Switzerland at No. 16. The second single, "Die Hölle muss warten", was released on 30 March 2012. Eisbrecher played at many festivals between May and September 2012, including Mera Luna Festival, Amphi Festival, the Wave-Gotik-Treffen festival, and the Nova Rock Festival, among others. During May and December 2012, Eisbrecher supported German rock band Scorpions for their shows on 12 & 13 May and 15 & 17 December 2012 in Germany. Die Hölle muss warten: Miststück Edition was released on 28 September 2012, featuring four new songs, including "Miststück 2012", a DVD with five live clips and all of the DHMW music videos, a tour documentary, and more. On the band's official website on 21 March 2013, Rupert Keplinger was announced as the band's new bass player. The reason for Dominik Palmer's departure from the band was not mentioned. In August, Eisbrecher performed at Wacken Open Air, the largest metal festival in the world. To celebrate the band's first 10 years, Eisbrecher went on a 10th anniversary tour in November and December. During the tour, the band released a single titled "10 Jahre Eisbrecher" on 29 November 2013. On 12 February 2014, Eisbrecher announced on their official website that they have entered the studio to begin work on their next album. They mentioned that due to the recording of the new album for an early 2015 release, that they have had to limit their number of shows in 2014.
