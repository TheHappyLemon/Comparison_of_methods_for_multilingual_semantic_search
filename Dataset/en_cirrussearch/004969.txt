Initially built by the French colonists as Moranc Airfield at Quản Long town, An Xuyên province (now Cà Mau City) with the runway of 400 m long and 16 m wide.

In dry season of 1972, the runway and the apron were repaved with asphalt. In April 1975, following the fall of Saigon, the airport was controlled by communist forces. From 1976 to 1978, this airport was used for military activities only. On 30 April 1995, this airport revived the civil flight with an AN2 VF808. Civil services continued but with low profit. From 1997, the civil scheduled flight services suspended due to low traffic, only chartered flight remained. On 30 April 1996, the old terminal was renovated.
