The USA Basketball Women's National Team, commonly known as the United States women's national basketball team, is governed by USA Basketball and competes in FIBA Americas. The team is by far the most successful in international women's basketball, having won nine out of the eleven Olympic tournaments it had entered. It has also won nine of the last twelve World Cups (including the last four), and eleven titles overall. The team is currently ranked first in the FIBA World Rankings. In 2016, it was named the USA Basketball Team of the Year for a record sixth time (having been previously honored in 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012). It was also named the USOC Team of the Year in 1996. The team is one of the most dominant in all Olympic sports, with a 70–3 record in Olympic play, and a record seven consecutive titles. They have no Olympic losses since 1992, no losses in any tournament since 2006, and their gold medal in 2021 tied the U.S. men's basketball team's record (1936–1968) for the most consecutive Olympic team victories in all Olympic sports.
