The China men's national basketball team (Chinese: 中国国家男子篮球队; nickname Team Dragon) represents the People's Republic of China in international basketball tournaments. The national team is governed by the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). Based on the number of tournament titles, China is considered a major basketball powerhouse in Asia and has by far the most successful basketball program on the continent. China has traditionally been the basketball powerhouse in Asia and won the FIBA Asia Cup 14 out of 16 times between 1975 and 2005. At the 1984 Summer Olympics basketball tournament, the Chinese made their debut, starting a streak of nine qualifications in a row. At the 2000 Olympics, Li Nan had a noteworthy performance as he scored 25 points on 6 three-pointers in a win against Italy. The Chinese failed to defend its championship at the 2007 FIBA Asia Cup. This was due to the automatic berth at the 2008 Beijing Olympics as the host nation, thus, China sent its "U23"Team to the 2007 tournament and finished 10th while its primary "A" team participated at the 2007 Stanković Cup which took place around the same time as the 2007 FIBA Asia Cup. The team often struggled against top flight non-Asian competitors. However, in some cases, China refuted their critics and beat some the top European teams. In the 2004 Athens Olympics, China, coached by Del Harris, advanced to the final eight after a 67–66 win over defending world champion Serbia and Montenegro. At the 2006 FIBA World Cup, China, coached by Lithuanian Jonas Kazlauskas also advanced to the second round from Group D, earning two victories against Senegal and Slovenia in five group play matches before falling in the round of sixteen to the eventual silver medalists Greece, 95–64; the team's overall placing by the end of the tournament from amongst the twenty-four competing sides was fifteenth. In 2008, some questions surrounded whether the recently injured Yao Ming would still captain the squad. In mid-July, it was confirmed that he would still continue to be the captain. At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, Yao ended up as the third leading scorer of the competition with 20.7 points per game while also leading in rebounds with 9.3 per game. The game where Yao really made his mark was against New Zealand where he scored a tournament-high 39 points while also grabbing 13 rebounds, second most in a single game that year. In the following years, the Chinese faced major struggles with injuries. In 2008, a then NBA prospect Xu Yong was forced to end his career at the age of 19 after being diagnosed with osteosarcoma. In December 2010, Yao was diagnosed with a stress fracture on his left ankle – the injury was related to the ankle sprain that he suffered earlier that year. Speculations arose whether China's basketball icon would ever be able to play again. When Yao's retirement was finally announced in July 2011 it was considered a big blow to the national team, whose success had largely depended on him for many years. Yet, critics were optimistic that China would continue to improve on its international performances. In 2016, a new era of Chinese stars would begin to form, as NBA draftees in Zhou Qi and Wang Zhelin would gain considerable amounts of attention for their successes in China. At the 2012 Olympics, it was Yi Jianlian who stepped up by averaging 14.8 points and 10.2 rebounds per game, highlighted by a 30-point, 12-rebound game against Spain to start the tournament. In 2018, the team was invited to play at the 2018 NBA Summer League. They played a total of 5 games and won 1. China hosted the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup which automatically qualified the team. In November 2021, China announced its 16-player squad for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification. The Guangdong Southern Tigers and the Liaoning Flying Leopards, the finalists of the 2020–21 Chinese Basketball Association season, contributed most as each team had four players called up. 2012 FIBA Asia Cup – 4th 2014 FIBA Asia Cup – 5th 2016 FIBA Asia Challenge – 5th 1974 Asian Games – 3rd 1978 Asian Games – 1st 1982 Asian Games – 2nd 1986 Asian Games – 1st 1990 Asian Games – 1st 1994 Asian Games – 1st 1998 Asian Games – 1st 2002 Asian Games – 2nd 2006 Asian Games – 1st 2010 Asian Games – 1st 2014 Asian Games – 5th 2018 Asian Games – 1st 2022 Asian Games – 3rd 2009 East Asian Basketball Championship – 3rd 2011 East Asian Basketball Championship – 3rd 2013 East Asian Basketball Championship – 2nd 2017 East Asian Basketball Championship – 4th 1993 East Asian Games – 1st 1997 East Asian Games – 3rd 2001 East Asian Games – 1st 2005 East Asian Games – 3rd 2009 East Asian Games – 4th 2013 East Asian Games – 2nd Roster for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.
