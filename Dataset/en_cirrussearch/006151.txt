Novolazarevskaya Station (Russian: Станция Новолазаревская) is a Russian, formerly Soviet, Antarctic research station. The station is located at Schirmacher Oasis, Queen Maud Land, 75 km (47 mi) from the Antarctic coast, from which it is separated by Lazarev Ice Shelf. It was opened on January 18, 1961 by the 6th Soviet Antarctic Expedition. The maximum summer population is 70. Novolazarevskaya has an airstrip (ICAO:AT17) that serves both research-related and commercial flights. In 2010 GLONASS differential reference station started to work in Novolazarevskaya. The reference station also provides Internet to Novolazarevskaya personnel. Novolazarevskaya is 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) east of India's Maitri research station. The Novo runway is a blue ice runway, located 8.7 kilometres (5.4 mi) away, operated by Antarctic Logistics Centre International (ALCI) serves the station and Maitri. Novolazarevskaya Staation is the site of perhaps the most famous surgery to remove an appendix ever undertaken. In April 1961, Dr Leonid Ivanovich Rogozov, the 27-year-old Soviet surgeon, performed an appendectomy on himself after developing acute appendicitis.
