Australidelphia is the superorder that contains roughly three-quarters of all marsupials, including all those native to Australasia and a single species — the monito del monte — from South America. All other American marsupials are members of the Ameridelphia. Analysis of retrotransposon insertion sites in the nuclear DNA of a variety of marsupials has shown that the South American monito del monte's lineage is the most basal of the superorder. The Australian australidelphians form a clade, for which the name Euaustralidelphia ("true Australidelphia") has been proposed (the branching order within this group is yet to be determined). The study also showed that the most basal of all marsupial orders are the other two South American groups (Didelphimorphia and Paucituberculata, with the former probably branching first). This indicates that Australidelphia arose in South America along with the other major divisions of extant marsupials, and likely reached Australia via Antarctica in a single dispersal event after Microbiotheria split off. Phylogeny of living Australidelphia based on the work of May-Collado, Kilpatrick & Agnarsson 2015 with extinct clades from Black et al. 2012 (*)This clade has been called Agreodontia by other authors since 2014. The orders within this group are listed below: Genera †Djarthia Godthelp, Wroe & Archer 1999 Order †Yalkaparidontia Archer, Hand & Godthelp 1988 Family †Yalkaparidontidae Archer, Hand & Godthelp 1988 ?Order Microbiotheria (1 species) ?Family Microbiotheriidae: monito del monte Order Dasyuromorphia (71 species) Family †Thylacinidae: thylacine Family Dasyuridae: antechinuses, quolls, dunnarts, Tasmanian devil, and allies Family Myrmecobiidae: numbat Order Peramelemorphia (21 species) Family Thylacomyidae: bilbies Family †Chaeropodidae: pig-footed bandicoots Family Peramelidae: bandicoots and allies Order Notoryctemorphia (2 species) Family Notoryctidae: marsupial moles Order Diprotodontia (117 species) Family Phascolarctidae: koala Family Vombatidae: wombats Family Phalangeridae: brushtail possums and cuscuses Family Burramyidae: pygmy possums Family Tarsipedidae: honey possum Family Petauridae: striped possum, Leadbeater's possum, yellow-bellied glider, sugar glider, mahogany glider, squirrel glider Family Pseudocheiridae: ringtailed possums and allies Family Potoridae: potoroos, rat kangaroos, bettongs Family Acrobatidae: feathertail glider and feather-tailed possum Family Hypsiprymnodontidae: musky rat-kangaroo Family Macropodidae: kangaroos, wallabies, and allies Family †Thylacoleonidae: marsupial lions Family †Palorchestidae: marsupial tapirs Family †Diprotodontidae: giant wombats "PBDB". paleobiodb.org.
