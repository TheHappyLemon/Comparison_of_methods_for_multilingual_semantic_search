"Your Love Is A Lie" is the second single by Canadian rock band Simple Plan from their third album Simple Plan. The song's chord progressions are similar to Green Day's "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" and Oasis' "Wonderwall". The band flew to Los Angeles to shoot the music video on March 6. The video was directed/produced by Wayne Isham. The video is a straightforward representation of the song. It intersperses shots of the band playing (later in the video, amid wind-blown blossoms) with shots of Pierre Bouvier's girlfriend, meeting (and having sex) with another man, while Bouvier, betrayed by the woman, waits in agony in his apartment. His apartment has a view of the man's apartment, with a clear view of a bedroom's window, where he sees them have sex. The song was performed at the closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics. All tracks are written by Simple Plan and Arnold Lanni, except where noted https://www.allmusic.com/song/t13651477 Chart Blog.
