Międzyzdroje (pronounced ['mʲɛnd͡zɨˈzdrɔjɛ]; German: Misdroy), historically known as Misdroy in English, is a city and a seaside resort in northwestern Poland on the island of Wolin on the Baltic coast. The city is located in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship, and is a seat of the Kamień County and the municipality of Międzyzdroje. In 2016, it was inhabited by around 5,500 people. The town is often referred to as The Pearl of the Baltic. It is situated between wide sandy beaches with high cliffs and the forests of the Woliński National Park (which includes a bison reserve). Międzyzdroje has a spa climate and is rich in tourist services. The territory became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967. Following the fragmentation of Poland, it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. Towards the very end of the 12th century two settled camps or settlements have been established within the present-day town limits. Both of these settlements, with a mining and agricultural focus, were property of the Bishopric of Kamien Pomorski. The first initial name of the town appeared in the 15th century as Misdroige. According to sources, the early Slavic and Germanic settlers were involved primarily in agriculture, cattle-breeding, fishing, bee-keeping and hunting. The entire island of Wolin, including Międzyzdroje, was captured by the Swedish Empire in 1630 during the Thirty Years' War. Sweden ceded control of the island to Prussia in the 1720 Treaties of Stockholm. A particularly noticeable increase in the number of inhabitants, mostly local but also foreign, was recorded throughout the 18th century. During this time, the village began to evolve into a luxurious spa resort as a result of strong English influence in the development of sea baths. In the first half of the industrial 19th century, Europeans of different backgrounds began to visit Misdroy and appreciate its baths, health clinics and favourable climate. With the arrival of tourists and the development of the tourist sector in the area, the once small, insignificant fishing village rapidly transformed into a popular health resort. In 1835, the gender-segregated baths were constructed by English and German merchants and entrepreneurs. Wealthy industrialists and business magnates from Stettin (Szczecin), Berlin and London would erect their magnificent and extravagant villas along the Baltic shore. One of the earliest public parks was created in 1860 as an initiative of a wealthy Belgian merchant named Arnold Lejeune. A wooden pier on the Baltic Sea was constructed and eventually upgraded in 1906. The pier was 360 metres in length and the coffee-house situated at its very end still operates to this day. In 1899, Misdroy was connected via railway with nearby Szczecin (Stettin) and Świnoujście, which contributed to an even greater number of patient and tourist arrivals. Shortly before the outbreak of World War I, over 20,000 visitors were recorded, an astonishing and record-breaking number in that period. Prior to World War II, the town had around 4,000 permanent residents. During World War II, in February 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Allied prisoners-of-war from the Stalag XX-B POW camp passed through the settlement. The town did not suffer destruction during the course of the war. After the war, the Międzyzdroje became part of the Polish People's Republic in 1945 in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and was granted town status. The town's Polish name comes from its original 16th century meaning of the "town between salts springs", or Międzyzdroje in Polish. In 1959, town limits were expanded.

Nazwa Międzyzdroje z pewnością etymologicznie oznacza to, co 'znajduje się między zdrojami, czyli miejscami ziemi, skąd wytryskuje woda, solanka', i początkowo określała 'osadę położoną między zdrojami' (od XIX wieku miejscowość stała się uzdrowiskiem kąpielowym właśnie dzięki solankom).
