Presidium Convent (Prezidiju Konvents) also known as simply (P!K!) is an organisation that unites all-male academic corporations in Latvia. Presidium Convent was established in autumn 1919, almost together with the University of Latvia. However it de facto started work only in autumn 1920, after the Latvian War of Independence ended. Founders of Presidium Convent were the five oldest Latvian student corporations: Lettonia, Selonija, Lettgallia, Talavija, Fraternitas Lettica. In the interwar period many new Latvian student corporations were admitted to Presidium Convent. In 1920s all Baltic-German corps (Curonia, Fraternitas Baltica, Concordia Rigensis, Fraternitas Rigensis, Rubonia, Gotonia) were also admitted. However, in 1932 all left in protest at a decision that the Latvian language must be used in Presidium Convent meetings. In 1940, after Soviet occupation of Latvia, Presidium Convent were closed, like other Latvian student organisations. After the Second World War most of Latvian student corporations renewed their work in exile. In such conditions, it was impossible to renew Presidium Convent in its pre-war shape, so in 1949 a new global organization was formed which united all Latvian student corporations in exile, the Union of Latvian Corporations (Latvian: Latvijas Korporāciju apvienība). Presidium Convent was restored in Latvia in 1990. Today it unites 22 Latvian and 1 Russian student corporations.
