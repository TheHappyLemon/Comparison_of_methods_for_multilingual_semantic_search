During the 16-day Spacelab flight, the seven-member crew aboard Space Shuttle Columbia served as both experimental subjects and operators for 26 life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. The STS-90 flight orbited the Earth 256 times and covered 6.3 million miles. STS-130 (February 8, 2010 – February 21, 2010) She also journeyed to the International Space Station as a mission specialist for Space Shuttle mission STS-130.
