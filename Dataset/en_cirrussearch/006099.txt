Arena AufSchalke (German pronunciation: [aˈʁeːnaː ʔaʊfˈʃalkə]), currently known as Veltins-Arena (pronounced [ˈfɛltɪnsʔaˌʁeːnaː]) for sponsorship reasons, is a retractable roof football stadium in Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It opened on 13 August 2001, as the new home ground for FC Schalke 04. It hosted the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final and five matches at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, including a quarter-final and it will host four matches in Euro 2024. It has a capacity of 62,271 (standing and seated) for league matches and 54,740 (seated only) for international matches. The stadium has a retractable roof and a retractable pitch. The naming rights to the stadium were sold on 1 July 2005 to German brewery Veltins. Plans to construct a new stadium emerged[vague] in the late 1990s, as fans and managers sought to move out of the outdated Parkstadion, and create a thoroughly[tone] modern multifunctional arena. Following Schalke 04's historic[tone] 1997 victory in the UEFA Cup, and the club's upcoming 100th anniversary in 2004, the contract to construct a €186 million stadium was given in 1998 to the German construction firm HBM. The site chosen for Schalke 04's new stadium is in the direct vicinity of the old Parkstadion, on an extensive piece of club owned property known as the "Berger Feld". Unfortunately,[tone] two mine shafts of the "Consolidation" and "Hugo" coal-mines run directly beneath this field at a depth of 800 m.[citation needed] These shafts (in use until 2000) would have caused unwanted shifts and tensions that could have[according to whom?] compromised the structural integrity of the stadium.[citation needed] To avoid this, the main axis was rotated from the classic north–south arrangement to a northeast–southwest alignment, making the arena parallel to the mines. The Veltins-Arena was created as a multi-functional arena of two tiers that completely surround the playing field. These allow for a league capacity of 62,271 spectators (standing and seated) and an international capacity of 54,740. For league matches, the North stand is left as standing rows (capacity: 16,307) to accommodate the Schalke 04 fans,[vague] while for international matches, these are converted to seats (capacity: 8,600). The 72 VIP lounges form a ring around the entire stadium, separating the first tier from the second tier. On the main Western grandstand, the VIP capacity is increased by a second level of lounges directly beneath the main belt. The foundation for the stadium was created out of cast concrete and 600,000 cubic metres (21,000,000 cu ft) of packed slag, a waste product from the steel smelting industry.[citation needed] These were packed into mounds to support the four main stands, which were made out of pre-fabricated, reinforced concrete sections.[citation needed] Leading into the four corners of the arena are 4.50 by 4.50 metres (14.8 ft × 14.8 ft) tunnels, which serve both as access for construction and assembly, and as ventilation for the interior. The Veltins-Arena features a Teflon-coated fiberglass canvas retractable roof, which spans the entire stadium. The roof is supported by a rectangular truss that is suspended above the field, which is in turn connected to the main building via 24 steel pylons. The center of the roof can be opened into two halves, allowing for an opened or covered stadium, depending on weather and event. To reduce the exterior noise of up to 105 decibels during concerts, a second layer of Teflon-coated fiberglass canvas was added over the first, creating a dampening air cushion.[citation needed] Hanging 25 metres (82 ft) over the center of the pitch are four video screens, each with a surface area of 35 square metres (380 sq ft). The centrally suspended scoreboard, similar to those found inside indoor sports arenas, was the first of its kind in football stadium,[citation needed] and has since been copied in the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt and the Esprit Arena in Düsseldorf. Like the Sapporo Dome in Japan, the State Farm Stadium and Allegiant Stadium in the U.S. and the GelreDome in the Netherlands,[citation needed] the Veltins-Arena features a slide-out pitch. Supported by a 11,400-tonne (11,200-long-ton; 12,600-short-ton) substructure, the playing field can be moved in and out of the stadium within four hours.[citation needed] This has several advantages: The grass playing surface can grow under normal outside conditions without suffering from a lack of circulation and light as in other arenas. The football pitch is not damaged during indoor events such as concerts. The floor of the multi-functional hall can be converted and retro-fitted within a short amount of time. The outside area that is not occupied by the field can be used as parking facilities for buses during football matches. To provide for over 60,000 spectators, the Veltins-Arena is equipped with an abundance[tone] of catering facilities. With 15 small restaurants, 50 grilling stations and 35 cafés, the stadium can serve up to 2,500 kilograms (5,500 lb) of sausages, 7,000 pretzels, and 1,000 square metres (11,000 sq ft) of pizza in one day.[citation needed] These catering areas are connected to a 5-kilometre (3.1 mi) long beer-line, supplying them with roughly 52,000 litres (11,000 imp gal; 14,000 US gal) of beer per match day. The Veltins-Arena has hosted an array[tone] of important[according to whom?] events, including the UEFA Champions League final of 2004. During the renovation of Rheinstadion in Düsseldorf, the Arena served as the temporary home of the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe, an American football league.[citation needed] World Bowl XII was hosted by the stadium.[citation needed] The versatility of the stadium was put to the test[tone] in May 2004 when the Veltins-Arena hosted a pop concert, a Bundesliga match and an NFL Europe game all within 96 hours.[citation needed] Other events have included the biathlon World Team Challenge exhibition race, stock car races and operas.[citation needed] In June 2009, it was the scene of a world heavyweight championship boxing match between Wladimir Klitschko and Ruslan Chagaev, which drew an audience of 60,000. On 18 July 2023, the Veltins-Arena decided to bid for[vague] one of the UEFA Europa League final or a UEFA Women's Champions League final for either 2026 or 2027. The stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 World Cup. However, because FIFA controls all sponsorship associated with its tournaments (including that of competition venues),[citation needed] the arena was called FIFA World Cup Stadium Gelsenkirchen (German: FIFA WM-Stadion Gelsenkirchen; [ˈfiːfa ˈvɛltmaɪ̯stɐʃaftˌʃtaːdi̯ɔn ɡɛlzn̩ˈkɪʁçn̩]) during the World Cup.[citation needed] Wayne Rooney was sent off for England in the quarterfinal game against Portugal. The following games were played at the stadium during the 2006 World Cup: 2007 Speedway Grand Prix of Germany The Veltins-Arena hosted the final Grand Prix of the 2007 motorcycle speedway World Championship season on 13 October 2007, the 2007 Speedway Grand Prix of Germany, the 100th Grand Prix in the history of the competition. It was billed[by whom?] as "The richest minute in motorsport".[citation needed] The winner of the event won US$100,000 by virtue of winning the final heat of the event, with each heat taking about one minute to complete.[citation needed] 25,000 fans saw the Grand Prix won by Swedish rider Andreas Jonsson, who beat American Greg Hancock, and Australians, Jason Crump and Leigh Adams in the final.[citation needed] Nicki Pedersen who went out of the competition at the semi-final stage was crowned World Champion. The temporary speedway track at the Veltins-Arena was 300 metres (330 yards) in length.[citation needed] Andreas Jonsson and Greg Hancock jointly hold the four-lap record, having set a time of 56.9 seconds in heats 21 and 23 respectively. 2008 Speedway Grand Prix of Germany The Veltins-Arena was supposed to host the 2008 Speedway Grand Prix of Germany. It was scheduled to take place on 11 October 2008. However, the meeting was cancelled because the track (temporary) was deemed unsafe by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) jury due to adverse weather conditions (even though the retractable roof was closed for the duration of laying the track). The event was re-staged at the Polonia Stadium, Bydgoszcz, Poland, on 18 October and was renamed the 2008 FIM Final Speedway Grand Prix. The opening game of the 74th IIHF World Championship took place at Veltins-Arena on 7 May 2010. At this occasion the crowd of 77,803 set a then World Record for ice hockey attendance. The host team Germany beat the United States 2–1 in overtime. The stadium hosted the 2018 German Darts Masters. The event achieved a record-breaking attendance of 20,210, the most ever at a darts event. The event was won by Mensur Suljović. The stadium will be one of the venues for the UEFA Euro 2024. However, due to sponsorship contracts, the arena will use its non-sponsored name during the tournament. The following matches will be played at the stadium: The arena is frequently used as a venue to host concerts. It has hosted three editions of the Rock im Pott festival, in 2012, 2013, and 2017, with artists like Placebo, The BossHoss, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Biffy Clyro, Deftones, Casper, Tenacious D, Volbeat and System of a Down. The arena hosted other concerts besides Rock im Pott by artists like The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, Guns N' Roses, Robbie Williams, Metallica, AC/DC, U2, Coldplay, Depeche Mode, Hardwell, Ed Sheeran, Pur, Herbert Grönemeyer and Pink. It is one of the stages for an upcoming Rammstein stadium tour and Taylor Swift's highly anticipated Eras Tour. Highly acclaimed,[by whom?] the Veltins-Arena served as a model for State Farm Stadium. This stadium shares features with its German counterpart such as a retractable roof and a slide-out pitch. Veltins-Arena has also been a source of inspiration[vague] for Friends Arena. The arena also has ties to Lucas Oil Stadium. In that stadium, the retractable-roof also opens lengthwise from the center to the touchlines.
