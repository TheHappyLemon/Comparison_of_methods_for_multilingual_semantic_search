Mikhail Mikhailovich Youzhny (born 25 June 1982), nicknamed "Misha" and "Colonel" by his fans, is a Russian former professional tennis player who was ranked inside the top 10 and was the Russian No. 1. He achieved a top-10 ranking by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for the first time on 13 August 2007, and reached a career peak of world No. 8 in January 2008, and again in October 2010.Youzhny reached the quarterfinals of all majors, reaching the semifinals at the US Open in 2006 and 2010. The closest he came to a major final was at the 2006 US Open semifinals when he took the first set from world No. 9 Andy Roddick, after upsetting world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals. At the other semifinal he lost in straight sets to the eventual champion, Nadal. Youzhny reached the finals of 21 ATP Tour-level titles, winning ten of them. He reached ATP Tour finals on all surfaces, but never won a singles title on grass. In 2010—his best season—Youzhny reached five ATP finals, winning two and ending the year as a top-10 player. Youzhny was a member of the winning Russian national team at the Davis Cup in both 2002 and 2006, playing a crucial role in 2002 when he won the deciding rubber after coming back from two-sets-to-love down. Youzhny was born on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a professional tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed his career in the Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin [ru] became his coach. At the age of 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia – United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would watch how coaches were working with students. Then we would make our own drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [a] coach". Sobkin continued: "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes and then comes a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. There was something in Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. Of course, I did not see Mischa is Top 10 player then. But I could see he had something special." Youzhny played in his first junior tournament in April 1995 at the 8th Sochi International Junior Tournament, but lost in the first round to Andrei Stoliarov. He next played in a junior tournament—the Ozerov Cup—in 1997, where he reached the semifinals but lost to Belarusian Maxim Belski. In the quarterfinals, Youzhny beat Nikolay Davydenko.

In the third match he partnered with Dmitry Tursunov against Novak Djokovic and Nenad Zimonjić but lost. However, despite his doubles loss, Russia advanced and won 3–2. Russia, which was world number one, was heavily favored in their match against Israel.[citation needed] The matches were hosted by Israel in the World Group quarterfinal tie in July 2009, on indoor hard courts at the Nokia Arena in Tel Aviv.[citation needed] Israel beat Russia in each of their first three matches, thereby winning the tie. world number 210 Harel Levy first beat world number twenty-four Igor Andreev, while world number thirty-three Dudi Sela followed by beating Youzhny in four sets. "This is a bit of a surprise", Youzhny said. He said he was very disappointed, and added: "I began very well, but after I took the first set, my luck fell away."

Therefore, I've made myself available for that tie." Youzhny won both of his rubbers, the first against Ricardo Mello, while he took over five hours to defeat Thomaz Bellucci, 14–12 in the fifth set. In his last Davis Cup match so far, in 2012, Youzhny partnered with Nikolay Davydenko to beat Austria doubles team Oliver Marach and Alexander Peya.[citation needed] Youzhny participated in three Summer Olympics; Athens 2004, Beijing 2008 and London 2012. In Athens he reached the quarterfinals and ended up losing to silver medalist Mardy Fish.

In the mixed doubles, however, he and teammate Elena Vesnina lost in the first round in straight sets to the Argentine team of Gisela Dulko and Juan Martín del Potro. Youzhny had powerful groundstrokes on both sides. Former professional tennis player and now coach Peter Lundgren stated that Youzhny's "backhand slice is one of the best in the world. His slice had a lot of variety and he can neutralise an opponent's offence quickly with it." However, while his backhand slice was a good defensive weapon, his main attacking weapon was his one-handed backhand hit with topspin. Youzhny used a backhand grip around 3/4 of the way from Continental toward Modified Eastern. His grip is close enough to Modified Eastern to allow him to hit topspin with reasonable comfort, but most players would hit stronger topspin with a grip right on Modified Eastern or closer to Full Eastern. Youzhny's backhand grip would work well for slice, but he changes to an Eastern forehand grip for his slice. When asked at the 2014 Dubai Tennis Championships about Youzhny, Novak Djokovic, then world no. 2, replied; Mikhail [...] has one of the nicest and most efficient one handed backhands on the tour. It seems a little bit unorthodox the way he holds his racquet, then [he] releases with two hands and in the end with one hand. But he's a very talented player. According to The New York Times columnist Christopher Clarley, Youzhny's one-handed backhand was one of the more unusual ones on tour, hit with a "free left arm accompanying his right arm as he swings through the ball." Veteran coach Sven Groeneveld jokingly said that Youzhny's should be called a "half one-hander". Youzhny hit the ball early on both sides, so as to "achieve a flatter flight trajectory and to get the ball to the opponent's side quicker." He was also noted for his good court sense and often used drop shots to mix up his game, and he was very talented at volleying. Youzhny was good on all surfaces, and was noted for his all-court game. Youzhny was noted for his ability to be able to change surfaces quickly without difficulty. However, his best surface is grass. He had 53 tour-level wins on grass. Kevin Mitchell from The Guardian referred to Youzhny as a grass-court specialist. Former Russian top-10 player Alex Metreveli referred to Youzhny as a "really a great fighter", he said, "I cannot even remember how many matches he has won in tough situations. Russian people respect Mischa because he is a man who works hard. And his fighting spirit is just incredible. What he did in Paris for Davis Cup is just one of many such examples." He had an ability to change rapidly to all conditions. However, a consistent weakness throughout his career was his serve. Robert Davis, an employee of the Association of Tennis Professionals, once wrote that "Youzhny serves up less aces than a poor luck poker player". Former top-10 British tennis player Tim Henman said that Youzhny had a solid serve, at least on grass. Youzhny was known on tour for his post-match military salute at the end of the match. Honoring his late father, Youzhny placed his racquet on his head while saluting the crowd instead of the hat that Russian military protocol dictates. Boris Sobkin was Youzhny's coach since the age of 10 because of Youzhny's father's interference. His fitness trainer is Oleg Mosiakov. Youzhny wore adidas clothing and Barricade 7.0 shoes and used a Head Head Graphene XT Extreme Pro racquet. The Russian government awarded Youzhny the title Honoured Master of Sports in 2003 for his participation in Russia's Davis Cup victory the previous year. Youzhny began studying for a degree in philosophy at the University of Moscow in 2005, specializing in the philosophy and attitudes of tennis. He obtained his PhD in December 2010. His thesis was entitled "Professional Tennis Players on the Court" and "was about other players and how they compared up against one another". When asked about his thesis, he said "I wrote it slowly when I had the time ... You find out about other players and try to compare them with you. You look at what you have to do against them or what changes they may make before their matches or during your match with them." Youzhny married Yulia on 22 November 2008 in Moscow; the couple have two sons and one daughter, Maxim born 2009, Igor born 2012 and Milana born 2019. Unfortunately, Yulia tragically passed away 9 January 2024.
