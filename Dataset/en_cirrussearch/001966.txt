Leopold the Cat (Russian: Кот Леопольд, Kot Leopold) is a Soviet animated short film series about a good-natured and prudent cat, Leopold. Leopold always wears a bow tie even when swimming. Throughout the series, he has to deal with two mischievous mice, Grey and White (Mitya and Motya according to an early script version, but the cartoons themselves mention no names). The animation was produced at T/O Ekran in 1975 – 1987 and its runtime is 87 min (10 episodes). As of 1987, there were 11 episodes in total. Eventually, in 1995, most of the episodes were released on DVD. It was directed by Anatoly Reznikov (Russian: Анатолий Резников), and the screenplay was written by Arkady Khait.

The character's unusual name came from the antagonist of the movie The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers named Colonel Leopold Sergeyevich Kudasov. Leopold's catchphrase is "Guys, let's all get along" (Russian: Ребята, давайте жить дружно). The catchphrases of the two mice are "Come out, Leopold!"
