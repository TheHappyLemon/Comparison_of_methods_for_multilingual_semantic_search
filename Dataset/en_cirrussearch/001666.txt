Following the championship victory, after not being re-signed during free agency, Gruda returned to the Sparks midway through the 2017 season. The Sparks would go on to advance to the Finals for the second season in a row, after defeating the Phoenix Mercury in a 3-game sweep, setting up a rematch with the Lynx. However, the Sparks would lose to the Lynx in five games. She played for the Russian club UMMC Ekaterinburg from 2007 to 2016. On 6 July 2016, Fenerbahçe Istanbul announced her transfer to the club.
