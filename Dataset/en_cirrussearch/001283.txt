Hut Point Peninsula (77°47′S 166°51′E﻿ / ﻿77.783°S 166.850°E﻿ / -77.783; 166.850) is a long, narrow peninsula from 2 to 3 nautical miles (3.7 to 5.6 km; 2.3 to 3.5 mi) wide and 15 nautical miles (28 km; 17 mi) long, projecting south-west from the slopes of Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica.McMurdo Station (US) and Scott Base (NZ) are Antarctic research stations located on the Hut Point Peninsula. The British National Antarctic Expedition (1901–04) under Robert Falcon Scott built its hut on Hut Point, at the southern headland of the peninsula. Members of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13 (BAE), under Scott, wintering on Cape Evans and often using the hut during their journeys, came to refer to the whole peninsula as the Hut Point Peninsula. Several features on Hut Point, including the cross memorial for George Vince and the store hut for the Scott expeditions, are protected under the Antarctic Treaty. Both the cross (HSM 19) and the hut (HSM 18) have been designated Historic Sites or Monuments, following proposals by New Zealand and the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. The point is protected as Antarctic Specially Protected Area No.158 largely because of its historic significance as one of the principal sites of early human activity in Antarctica. Hut Point Peninsula consists of a series of basaltic scoria cones, craters and domes that were formed in the last 1.34 million years. Other features around the Hut Point Peninsula include Sultans Head Rock, Descent Cliff, Hutton Cliffs, Turtle Rock, Knob Point, Danger Slopes, Arrival Heights, Crater Hill, Hut Point, Cape Armitage, Observation Hill, The Gap and Pram Point. 77°50′S 166°39′E﻿ / ﻿77.833°S 166.650°E﻿ / -77.833; 166.650. A crater on Arrival Heights, located 0.75 nautical miles (1.39 km; 0.86 mi) north of Hut Point.

A distinctive breached crater rising to 200 metres (660 ft) high about 0.8 nautical miles (1.5 km; 0.92 mi) east of Castle Rock. Named in 2000 by New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) after Deirdre Jeanette Sheppard, DSIR Antarctic Division/NZAP/Antarctica NZ librarian, 1980-96, who worked one season at Vanda Station. 77°48′28″S 166°44′50″E﻿ / ﻿77.807744°S 166.747093°E﻿ / -77.807744; 166.747093. A crater 0.5 nautical miles (0.93 km; 0.58 mi) southwest of Castle Rock. Descriptively named for its shape by Frank Debenham of British Antarctic Expedition (British Antarctic Expedition), 1910-13, who made a plane table survey of the peninsula in 1912. 77°50′26″S 166°41′10″E﻿ / ﻿77.840604°S 166.686128°E﻿ / -77.840604; 166.686128. A crater with twin nested cones that rises behind McMurdo Station and 0.5 nautical miles (0.93 km; 0.58 mi) west of Crater Hill. This crater was named Middle Crater by Frank Debenham of the British Antarctic Expedition (British Antarctic Expedition), 1910-13, apparently for its location in relation to First Crater and Crater Hill, but the name has fallen into disuse. Twin Crater, alluding to the nested cones in the crater, was applied as early as 1971 and the name has become established because of consistent use in current maps and reports.
