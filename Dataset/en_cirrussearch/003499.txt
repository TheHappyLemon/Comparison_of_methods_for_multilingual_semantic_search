The Eurovision Song Contest 1985 was the 30th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Gothenburg, Sweden, following the country's victory at the 1984 contest with the song "Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley" by Herreys. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and the host broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT), the contest was held at the Scandinavium on 4th May 1985. It was hosted by previous Swedish contestant Lill Lindfors. Nineteen countries participated in the contest, with Norway winning the contest for the first time with "La det swinge" by Bobbysocks!. Gothenburg is the second-most populated city in Sweden and the fifth-most populated in the Nordic countries. The construction of the arena commenced in 1969, following numerous setbacks over the years. The arena was opened on May 18, 1971, and played a role in the city's unsuccessful attempt to host the 1984 Winter Olympics. Scandinavium was the largest indoor venue in Sweden at the time. It remained the largest arena to host the event until the 2000 contest in Stockholm. The venue is currently home to the Frölunda HC team of the Swedish Hockey League and also hosts the annual Gothenburg Horse Show. A total of nineteen countries took part in the competition. Both Greece and Israel re-entered the competition following their absence in the preceding year. The Netherlands did not take part in the contest because of the national Remembrance of the Dead, while Yugoslavia also did not participate due to the anniversary of the death of Josip Broz Tito. In 1985, the final competition had fewer than 20 participants, marking the last occurrence of such a low number. Every show included a symphony led by a maestro. In 1985, there was a unique occurrence where multiple conductors were featured for several entries and countries. In 1985, 13 previous Eurovision artists took part for a second or third time, including the members of eventual winners Bobbysocks! who previously participated as soloists. Notably, Kikki Danielsson returned for host country Sweden, competing against Elisabeth Andreasson with whom she had participated alongside in the 1982 contest as part of the group Chips. Bold indicates a previous winner. Lill Lindfors staged a deliberate wardrobe malfunction as she proceeded to the stage to present the voting procedure; the skirt of her dress appeared to come away accidentally, leaving her in just her underwear and the top half of her dress. After a few seconds, however, Lindfors unfastened the flaps of her dress across her shoulders to reveal a full-length white gown. Lindfors then took her seat to start calling in the votes, stating "I just wanted to wake you up a little." Each country nominated a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for their respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1985 contest are listed below:  Sweden – Agneta Bolme Börjefors  United Kingdom – Colin Berry As in previous contests, each country had a jury who awarded a set number of points for each of their top ten songs. Norway took and kept the lead with only three countries remaining to vote, in one of the shortest winning stretches during voting in the contest's history.[citation needed] Below is a summary of all 12 points, the highest scoring amount, given by juries in the final: Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks, with non-participating EBU member broadcasters also able to relay the contest as "passive participants". Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below: On behalf of the German public broadcasting consortium ARD Deferred broadcast at 22:30 CEST (20:30 UTC) Deferred broadcast at 22:55 CEST (20:55 UTC) Deferred broadcast on 5 May at 19:30 AEST (09:30 UTC) Delayed broadcast on 1 June 1985 at 11:05 CEST (09:05 UTC) Deferred broadcast on 6 May at 10:00 CEST (08:00 UTC) Delayed broadcast on 25 May 1985 at 20:00 CEST (18:00 UTC) Roxburgh, Gordon (2017).
