Rochette was nominated to represent Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics after winning her sixth straight Canadian National title. At the Olympic Village, Rochette received the news that her mother had died shortly after arriving in Vancouver. Upon hearing the news, NBC speed-skating commentator Dan Jansen sent an e-mail to Rochette and shared his experiences of his sister's death during the Calgary Olympics (Canada's last Olympics before Vancouver). Rochette chose to continue competing in her mother's honour. She recorded a new personal best in the short program, scoring 71.36 points, the third highest score of the night. Two days later, she held on to her third-place position after the long program and won the bronze medal. She became the fifth Canadian to win a medal in ladies' figure skating at the Olympics. Rochette's performance at the 2010 Olympics figure skating gala on February 27 featured the original French version of Celine Dion's song "Fly", «Vole» as a tribute to her mother (a long-time fan of Dion), ending with her face raised to the heavens. Because of her inspiring determination in the face of these circumstances, along with Petra Majdič, she received the inaugural Terry Fox Award for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Fellow Canadian Olympian Jon Montgomery described Rochette as having shown "so much heart and determination at the 2010 Games (...) What she displayed is honestly what the Olympics are all about." Rochette was chosen as the flag bearer for the closing ceremony. In December 2010, Rochette was voted the Female Athlete of the Year by The Canadian Press. She did not compete at the 2010 World Championships and later announced that she would not take part in the 2010–11 Grand Prix series. In an October 2012 interview, Rochette said she was weighing a return to competition. She confirmed in September 2013 that she would not compete for a spot to the 2014 Olympics but would travel to Sochi with the CBC for an undetermined role mainly in French. In August 2017, Skate Canada announced Rochette would be inducted into the Skate Canada Hall of Fame as a member of the 2017 class. On February 21, 2010, two days before the beginning of ladies' figure skating competition at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver, her mother, Thérèse Rochette, died of a heart attack at age 55 at Vancouver General Hospital after arriving to watch her compete; Rochette chose to remain in the competition and skate in her mother's honour. At her mother's funeral, she placed her Olympic bronze medal on the casket for some time. Rochette has been a spokesperson for the "iheartmom" campaign at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, which deals with raising awareness for heart disease in women. She has also worked with World Vision. Rochette received her DEC from Collège André-Grasset's Natural Sciences program in November 2011. It took 7 years for her to complete the program, which could have been finished in two or three years under normal circumstances.

In September 2017, Rochette participated in a white coat ceremony at the start of her second year in the medical school.
