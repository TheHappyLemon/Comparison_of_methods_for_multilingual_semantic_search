Victor Thibault (8 March 1867 in Paris – 3 May 1941 in Saillans, Drôme) was a French competitor in the sport of archery. Thibault competed in two events at the 1900 Summer Olympics, and won second prize in each. He is now considered by the International Olympic Committee to have won two silver medals.[1] Both of Thibault's events were the shorter 33 metre competitions, in both the Au Chapelet and Au Cordon Doré style.
