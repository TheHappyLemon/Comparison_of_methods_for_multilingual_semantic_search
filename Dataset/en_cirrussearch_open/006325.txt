.nr is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Nauru. Domains must be paid, and can be ordered from CenpacNet, Nauru's Internet service provider. The original configuration of the .nr TLD domain was performed by Shaun Moran of ComTech Communications (Australia) in 1998 as part of the first Internet connectivity on the Island. There was a lengthy process with IANA to get the .nr domain approved and assigned at the time. The setup of .nr was done in 2002 by Franck Martin using specific custom code.
