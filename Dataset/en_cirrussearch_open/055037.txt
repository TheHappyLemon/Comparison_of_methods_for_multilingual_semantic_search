Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild is a 2005 American animated adventure comedy film directed by Audu Paden, distributed by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. It was released on DVD in other countries in 2005, until it was eventually released in North America on February 21, 2006. It is the third and final installment in the Stuart Little trilogy. In the film, Stuart and his family spend their summer vacation in a cabin near Lake Garland. During the vacation, Stuart befriends a smooth-talking anthropomorphic skunk named Reeko, and the family cat Snowbell is taken by a mysterious beast. Michael J. Fox, Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie reprise their roles as Stuart Little, Eleanor Little and Frederick Little, while Snowbell, George and Monty are now voiced by Kevin Schon, Corey Padnos and Rino Romano (replacing Nathan Lane, Jonathan Lipnicki and Steve Zahn who previously portrayed and voiced them in the live-action films.) Unlike its predecessors, Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild is fully computer animated. It is also the only film in the series to not have a theatrical release, instead being released direct to video. Unlike the first two films, Call of the Wild received generally negative reviews.
