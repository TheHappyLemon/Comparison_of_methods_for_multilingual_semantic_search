The 1935 Ice Hockey World Championships were held from January 19 to January 27, 1935, at the Eisstadion Davos in Davos, Switzerland, in which a record 15 countries took part. The teams first played in four preliminary round groups (three groups of four and a group of three). Unlike in the previous year, Canada participated in the preliminary round. The first two teams in each group advanced to the semifinal round, while the remaining seven played in a consolation round to determine positions 9 through 15. In the semifinal round there were two groups of four teams. The first two teams in each group advanced to a final round while the remaining teams played for positions 5 though 8. Canada won its eighth world championship title while the host, Switzerland, won its second European championship.
