A pseudonym (/ˈsjuːdənɪm/; from Ancient Greek ψευδώνυμος (pseudṓnumos) 'lit. falsely named') or alias (/ˈeɪli.əs/) is a fictitious name that a person assumes for a particular purpose, which differs from their original or true name (orthonym). This also differs from a new name that entirely or legally replaces an individual's own. Many pseudonym holders use them because they wish to remain anonymous, but anonymity is difficult to achieve and often fraught with legal issues.
