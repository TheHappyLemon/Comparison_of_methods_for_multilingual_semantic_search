Haloo Helsinki! (English: Hello, Helsinki!) is a pop rock band from Finland, founded in 2006. They have released five studio albums, all of which have reached the top ten on the Finnish Albums Chart. From 2007 to 2012, the band were signed to EMI Finland and as their principal collaborators switched to a Sony sub-label, Ratas Music Group, the band followed suit. In 2013, Haloo Helsinki! became the first Finnish artist whose four consecutive singles ("Jos mun pokka pettää", "Huuda!", "Vapaus käteen jää", "Maailma on tehty meitä varten") have peaked at number one on the Chart of commercial Finnish radio stations.
