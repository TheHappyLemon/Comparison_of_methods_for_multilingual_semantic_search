The Krivichs or Kryvichs (Belarusian: крывічы́, romanized: kryvičý, IPA: [krɨvʲiˈt͡ʂɨ]; Russian: кри́вичи, tr. kríviči, IPA: [ˈkrʲivʲɪtɕɪ]) were a tribal union of Early East Slavs between the 6th and the 12th centuries. It is suggested that originally the Krivichi were native to the area around Pskov. They migrated to the mostly Finnic areas in the upper reaches of the Volga, Dnieper, Dvina, areas south of the lower reaches of river Velikaya and parts of the Neman basin. In some variants of Belarusiphile anti-normanist history, the city, and later principality of Polotsk is linked to Krivichians, much like Kyiv is linked to Polianians, however, based on most modern evidence, these were all likely linked to Rus' people.
