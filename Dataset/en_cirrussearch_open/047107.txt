At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, nine wrestling events were contested, all for men. There were four weight classes in Greco-Roman wrestling and five weight classes in freestyle wrestling. Greco-Roman reappeared for the first time since the 1896 Summer Olympics, with weight classes for the first time. The number of classes in freestyle was reduced from 7 to 5, with the light fly, fly, and welterweight classes dropped but the middleweight added. The addition of the 4 Greco-Roman classes brought the total number of events in wrestling up to 9.
