In music, a trio (from the Italian) is any of the following: a composition for three performers or three musical parts in larger works, the middle section of a ternary form (so named because of the 17th-century practice of scoring the contrasting second or middle dance appearing between two statements of a principal dance for three instruments) an ensemble of three instruments or voices performing trio compositions.
