Cape Jeremy is a cape marking the east side of the north entrance to George VI Sound and the west end of a line dividing Graham Land and Palmer Land, Antarctica. It was discovered by the British Graham Land expedition, 1934â€“37, under John Riddoch Rymill, who named it for Jeremy Scott, son of James Maurice Scott, who served as home agent for the expedition and was formerly a member of the British Arctic Air Route Expedition.
