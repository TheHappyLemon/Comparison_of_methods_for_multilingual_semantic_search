Alain C. White (March 3, 1880 to April 12, 1951) was an American conservationist and chess problem composer in the first half of the 20th century. He played a pivotal role in Connecticut land preservation, and founded the journal The Good Companion Chess Problem Club. The White Memorial Conservation Center in Litchfield, Connecticut, is created around his family's property. The lands that he purchased and donated to the State of Connecticut formed the foundation of the state's park system.
