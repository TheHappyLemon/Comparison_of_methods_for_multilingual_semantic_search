The national flag of Armenia (Armenian: Հայաստանի դրոշ), also known as the tricolour (Armenian: Եռագույն, Yeṙaguyn), consists of three horizontal bands of equal width, red on the top, blue in the middle, and orange on the bottom. The Armenian Supreme Soviet adopted the current flag on 24 August 1990. On 15 June 2006, the Law on the National Flag of Armenia, governing its usage, was passed by the National Assembly of Armenia. Throughout history, there have been many variations of the Armenian flag. In ancient times, Armenian dynasties were represented by different symbolic animals displayed on their flags. In the twentieth century, various Soviet flags represented the Armenian SSR. The meanings of the colours are interpreted in many different ways. The red stands for the Armenian highlands, the Armenian people's continued struggle for survival, maintenance of the Christian faith and Armenia's independence and freedom, Blue is for the Armenian peaceful skies, and orange represents the nation's talent and hard-work.
