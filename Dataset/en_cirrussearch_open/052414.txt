The European Jewish Parliament or EJP (formerly known as European Jewish Union or EJU) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in Brussels whose stated aim is to be "a uniting structure for all Jewish communities and organizations throughout Western, Eastern and Central Europe as well as establish a permanent relationship with the European Parliament as well as national parliaments." The EJU-backed EJP is the brainchild of Ukrainian billionaire Vadim Rabinovich.
