A siddur (Hebrew: סִדּוּר sīddūr, [siˈduʁ, 'sɪdəʁ]; plural siddurim סִדּוּרִים [siduˈʁim]) is a Jewish prayer book containing a set order of daily prayers. The word siddur comes from the Hebrew root ס־ד־ר‎, meaning 'order.' Other terms for prayer books are tefillot (תְּפִלּוֹת‎) among Sephardi Jews, tefillah among German Jews, and tiklāl (תכלאל) among Yemenite Jews.
