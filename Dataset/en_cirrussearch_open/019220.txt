Lamini (members are called lamines or laminoids) is a tribe of the subfamily Camelinae. It contains one extant genus with four species, all exclusively from South America: llamas, alpacas, vicu√±as, and guanacos. The former two are domesticated species, while the latter two are only found in the wild. None display sexual dimorphism. The four species can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Additionally, there are several extinct genera. The digestive system of lamoids allows them to digest certain toxins. Laminoids also lack a gallbladder.
