Ivan V Alekseyevich (Russian: Иван V Алексеевич; 6 September [O.S. 27 August] 1666 – 8 February [O.S. 29 January] 1696) was Tsar of all Russia between 1682 and 1696, jointly ruling with his younger half-brother Peter I. Ivan was the youngest son of Alexis I of Russia by his first wife, Maria Miloslavskaya, while Peter was the only son of Alexis by his second wife, Natalya Naryshkina. Ivan's reign was solely titular because he had serious physical and mental challenges.
