The 1969 Ice Hockey World Championships was the 36th edition of the Ice Hockey World Championships, which also doubled as the 47th European ice hockey championships. For the first time the Pool A, B and C tournaments were hosted by different nations: Pool A in Stockholm, Sweden, 15–30 March 1969 Pool B in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, 28 February – 9 March 1969 Pool C in Skopje, Yugoslavia, 24 February – 2 March 1969 A total of 20 nations participated in the tournament. The Pool A team featured only the top six nations, now playing a double round-robin tournament for the amateur world championship. Teams #7-#14 contested the Pool B championship with the winner qualifying for the 1970 Pool A championship, while the bottom six participated in the Pool C tournament. Pool B and C began exchanging two teams this year (through promotion and relegation), a practice that lasted until 1987.
