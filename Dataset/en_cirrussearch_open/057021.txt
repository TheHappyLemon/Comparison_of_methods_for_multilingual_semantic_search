The 1964–65 European Cup, the 10th season of the football club tournament, was won by Internazionale for the second time in row, in a final match against two-time former champions Benfica, making it three consecutive titles for Italy (Milan had won it in 1962–63). Iceland entered its champion for the first time this season, while Cyprus did not enter this time around.
