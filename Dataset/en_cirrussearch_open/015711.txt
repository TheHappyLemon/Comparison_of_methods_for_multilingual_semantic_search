"Kill the DJ" is a song by American rock band Green Day. It is the fifth track on their ninth studio album ¡Uno! (2012), and was released as the second single, on August 14, 2012. It is also the second from the ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! & ¡Tré! trilogy. The song was recorded at Jingletown Studios from February 14 to June 26, 2012, and was released on the record labels Reprise Records and Warner Bros. A music video, directed by Samuel Bayer, was released on September 4, 2012. The song takes influences from dance music, a departure for the band. "Kill the DJ" was compared to The Clash albums Sandinista! (1980) and Combat Rock (1982), as well as the output of the band the Rapture. "Kill the DJ" was based on "static and noise"; it was an "imagery of waterboarding and torture straight into the dance club". The song appeared on charts worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.
