Jabal Shams or Jebel Shams (Arabic: جَبَل شَمْس, lit. 'Mountain of Sun') is a mountain located in northeastern Oman north of the town of Al-Hamra. It is known as Jabal Shams because it is the first place to receive sunrise in Oman due to its high peak. It is the highest mountain of the Hajar range and the country. The mountain is a popular sightseeing area located 240 km (150 mi) from Muscat. In the summer, the temperature is around 20 °C (68 °F) and in the winter it drops to less than 0 °C (32 °F).[original research?] Jabal Shams also hosts Al Nakhur Canyon which is labeled as the Grand Canyon of Arabia. Nearby is Jabal Akhdar, another prominent peak in the region.
