The McDonnell Gambit is a chess opening gambit in the King's Gambit, Classical Variation that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Nc3 or alternatively via the Quaade Gambit: 4. Nc3 g4 5. Bc4 The opening is named after Alexander McDonnell, a 19th-century Irish chess master, who successfully introduced it in his third match with Louis-Charles Mah√© de La Bourdonnais. The aim is to gain a significant lead in development (knight, bishop, and queen) for the sacrificed knight, followed by a kingside attack. The McDonnell Gambit has always been much less popular for White than the similarly motivated Muzio Gambit (4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0). Although considered obsolete by MCO, it has not been thoroughly tested.
