Dracaena (/drəˈsiːnə/) is a genus of about 120 species of trees and succulent shrubs. The formerly accepted genera Pleomele and Sansevieria are now included in Dracaena. In the APG IV classification system, it is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae). It has also formerly been separated (sometimes with Cordyline) into the family Dracaenaceae or placed in the Agavaceae (now Agavoideae). The name dracaena is derived from the romanized form of the Ancient Greek δράκαινα – drakaina, "female dragon". The majority of the species are native to Africa, southern Asia through to northern Australia, with two species in tropical Central America.
