Benidorm (English: /ˈbɛnɪdɔːrm/ BEN-i-dorm, Valencian: [beniˈðɔɾm], Spanish: [beniˈðoɾ]) is a municipality in the province of Alicante, Valencian Community, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Benidorm has been a tourist destination within Spain since 1925, when its port was extended and the first hotels were built, though it would not be until the 1950s that it became renowned as a summer destination for people coming from inland Spain, especially Madrid. Today it is known for its hotel industry, beaches, and skyscrapers and receives as many tourists from abroad as from Spain. According to the 2020 census, Benidorm has a permanent population of 70,450 inhabitants, making it the fifth-most populous town in the Alicante province and the ninth in Valencian Community.
