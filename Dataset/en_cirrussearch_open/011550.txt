Fox Life was an international pay television network, launched by the Fox Networks Group in 2004. The network has been discontinued in several markets over time due to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney in 2019. The network's scheduling varied with each version, ranging from traditional entertainment programming, including television series, sitcoms and movies, among others, original programming in certain regions, and instructional and aspirational reality television on some other variations; in North America for instance, the network carried mainly Spanish language dubbed versions of American reality shows and instructional programming.
