Mercedes-Benz Stadium (known as Atlanta Stadium by FIFA's non-commercial policy) is a multi-purpose stadium located in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Opened in August 2017 as a replacement for the Georgia Dome, it serves as the home stadium of the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL) and Atlanta United FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). The stadium is owned by the state government of Georgia through the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, and operated by AMB Group, the parent organization of the Falcons and Atlanta United FC. In June 2016, the total cost of its construction was estimated at US$1.6 billion. The stadium officially opened on August 26, 2017, with a Falcons preseason game against the Arizona Cardinals, despite the retractable roof system being incomplete at the time. Several events formerly held at the Georgia Dome moved to Mercedes-Benz Stadium following its completion, including the SEC football championship game and the Peach Bowl. In 2018, it hosted the College Football Playoff National Championship and the MLS Cup (as Atlanta United FC held home field advantage), and it hosted Super Bowl LIII in 2019. The Mercedes-Benz Stadium will host the 2025 College Football Playoff National Championship and multiple matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
