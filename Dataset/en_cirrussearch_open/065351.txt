Club de Fútbol Monterrey, often known simply as Monterrey or their nickname Rayados, is a Mexican professional football club based in the Monterrey metropolitan area, Nuevo León, Mexico. The team currently plays in Liga MX, the top tier of Mexican football. Founded on 28 June 1945, it is the oldest active professional team from the northern part of Mexico. Since 1999 the club has been owned by FEMSA, Latin America's largest bottling company. Its home games have been played in the Estadio BBVA since 2015. Monterrey has won five league titles, three domestic cups, and five CONCACAF Champions League titles (notably, three consecutive tournaments in 2011, 2012 and 2013). The team's nickname of Rayados (The Striped-Ones) stems from the club's traditional navy blue striped uniform. The uniform is reflected in the club's current crest, which is also decorated with stars above the crest representing the club's league titles and stars below representing continental. In 2020 Monterrey became the second Mexican club to complete the continental treble. The club's oldest rival is Tigres UANL of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. The local derby, known as the Clásico Regiomontano, is known for being one of the most heated and intensely competed derbies in Mexican football, as both teams consistently rank among the highest in attendance and currently feature the most expensive squads in the country.
