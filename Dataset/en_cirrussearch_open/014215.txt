Sulfosalt minerals are sulfide minerals with the general formula AmBnXp, where A represents a metal such as copper, lead, silver, iron, and rarely mercury, zinc, vanadium B usually represents semi-metal such as arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and rarely germanium, or metals like tin and rarely vanadium X is sulfur or rarely selenium and/or tellurium. The Strunz classification includes the sulfosalts in a sulfides and sulfosalts superclass. A group which have similar appearing formulas are the sulfarsenides (for example cobaltite (Co,Fe)AsS). In sulfarsenides the arsenic substitutes for sulfide anions whereas in the sulfosalts the arsenic substitutes for a metal cation. About 200 sulfosalt minerals are known. Examples include: As illustrated by this specimen of proustite, sulfosalt minerals are often deeply colored.
