Water motorsport was on the Summer Olympic Games programme in 1900. These events have generally not been classified as official, although the IOC has never decided which events were "Olympic" and which were not. As with the official croquet events, some motorboating events satisfied three of four retrospective criteria â€” restriction to amateurs, open to all nations, open to all competitors and without handicapping. As with croquet, there were only French players. (All other official events met all four criteria.) Motorboating was also included in the 1908 Olympic Games.
