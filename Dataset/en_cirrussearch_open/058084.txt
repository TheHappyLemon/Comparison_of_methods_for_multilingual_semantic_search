Alexander Zverev (German pronunciation: [alɛkˈsandɐ ˈtsfeːʁɛf]; born 20 April 1997) is a German professional tennis player. He has been ranked by the ATP as high as world No. 2. Zverev's singles career highlights include a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and titles at the 2018 and the 2021 ATP Finals. He has won 21 ATP Tour titles in singles and two in doubles, and contested a major final at the 2020 US Open. Zverev is a former junior world No. 1, and won a junior major singles title at the 2014 Australian Open. He had an early breakthrough on the professional tour as well, becoming one of the youngest Challenger Tour title winners in history at the age of 17. As a teenager, Zverev won two ATP titles and upset then-world No. 3 Roger Federer on grass. At 20 years old, he became the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since Novak Djokovic. At the Laver Cup, Zverev has played an instrumental role in Team Europe's early success in the competition, winning the clinching matches in 2018 and 2019. After reaching his career-best results in 2021 and 2022, he suffered an ankle injury at the French Open, from which he recovered to re-enter the top 10 the following year. Zverev is the subject of assault allegations from two former partners, including the mother of his daughter. A German court issued a penalty order against Zverev, to which he objected, and he is scheduled to face trial in a Berlin Criminal Court starting in May 2024.
