The Latvian identity card (Latvian: Personas apliecÄ«ba), also known as Personal certificate, is an officially recognised biometric identity document issued to Latvian citizens. They are also valid for travel within Europe (except Belarus, Russia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom), Georgia, French Overseas territories, Montserrat (max. 14 days) and organized tours to Tunisia (without the need for a Latvian passport). Until 2023, when the card will become mandatory for most, Latvian citizens who hold a valid passport are not obliged to obtain an ID card. The card is mandatory if a citizen over the age of 15 does not have a passport.
