The Bornean ferret badger (Melogale everetti), also known as Everett's ferret badger or the Kinabalu ferret badger, is a small, nocturnal and omnivorous mammal that is endemic to the island of Borneo. It is a member of the family Mustelidae and is one of six species of the genus Melogale. It is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to its small distribution range, which includes Kinabalu National Park and Crocker Range National Park. Bornean ferret badgers weigh up to 3 kg (6.6 lb) and reach a maximum recorded body length of 44 cm (17 in). They forage on the ground for invertebrates, amphibians, insects, fruit and carrion. The overall population trend of the Bornean ferret badger is "assumed to be in at least shallow decrease", due to the numerous man-made (climate change and habitat destruction) and natural (natural disasters and epidemics) threats it faces.
