Alizé Cornet (French pronunciation: [alize kɔʁnɛ]; born 22 January 1990) is a French professional tennis player. She has won six singles and three doubles titles on the WTA Tour, as well as three singles and three doubles titles on the ITF Circuit. On 16 February 2009, she reached her highest WTA singles ranking of world No. 11. Cornet has also made the second week at each of the four Grand Slam events, having reached the quarterfinals at the 2022 Australian Open, and the fourth round at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships, the 2015 and 2017 French Opens, and the 2020 US Open. She holds the record for the most consecutive Grand Slam appearances with 68 and also in equal third place for overall appearances with 71. Cornet became known for defeating world No. 1 Serena Williams on three occasions in 2014. At the Dubai Tennis Championships she recorded a straight-sets win over Williams in the semifinals, which resulted in Cornet reaching her biggest singles final in almost six years. In July, at the Wimbledon Championships, she came back from a set down to upset Williams in the third round, handing the American her earliest exit at the tournament since 2005. Her third win came in the second round of Wuhan later that year, where Williams retired due to illness. Cornet also has an impressive junior record, reaching a career-high combined junior ranking of world No. 8, on 11 June 2007. She won her sole Grand Slam junior singles title at the 2007 French Open.
