The film, which was panned by critics, tells the story of a real estate developer being asked by his boss to take the place of a resigned employee and turn a forest into a residential development which evokes the wrath of the local forest animals. It was theatrically released on April 30, 2010. The film earned $36.2 million on a $35 million budget. Furry Vengeance was Fraser's final film as part of the William Morris Endeavor agency, as he switched to the Creative Arts Agency in 2010. This film was also Alice Drummond's final feature film role before her death on November 30, 2016.
