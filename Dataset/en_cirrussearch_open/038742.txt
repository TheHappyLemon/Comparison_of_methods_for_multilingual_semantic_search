The order Diplura ("two-pronged bristletails") is one of three orders of non-insect hexapods within the class Entognatha (alongside Collembola (springtails) and Protura). The name "diplura", or "two tails", refers to the characteristic pair of caudal appendages or filaments at the terminal end of the body. Around 800 species of diplurans have been described.
