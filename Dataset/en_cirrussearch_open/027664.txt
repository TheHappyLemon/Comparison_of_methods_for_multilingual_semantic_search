The largest cities in Europe within their city boundary have populations over one million inhabitants. Cities are sorted by official population. Capital cities are in bold. The list deals exclusively with the areas within city administrative boundaries as opposed to urban areas and metropolitan areas, which are generally larger in terms of population than the main city. As some cities have narrow boundaries and others wide ones, the list may not give an accurate view of the comparative magnitude of different places, and the figures in the list should be treated with caution, eg Paris is the second most populous urban area in Europe, but the strict definition of the administrative limits of the City of Paris results in a far lower population shown in the table.
