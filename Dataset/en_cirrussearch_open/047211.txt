Postimees (Estonian for '[The] Postman') is an Estonian daily newspaper established on 5 June 1857, by Johann Voldemar Jannsen. In 1891, it became the first daily newspaper in Estonia. Its current editor-in-chief is Priit Hõbemägi. The paper has approximately 250 employees. Postimees is currently published five days a week and has the largest circulation and readership in Estonia with 55,000 copies sold during the workweek and over 72,000 on weekends. Ninety-seven per cent of the paper's circulation is subscription-based with only three per cent sold individually. The weekend edition of Postimees, published on Saturdays, includes several separate sections: AK (Arvamus ja Kultuur), Arter, and a television-guide. The paper is owned by namesake media company Postimees Group (formerly known as Eesti Meedia), which a company owned by entrepreneur Margus Linnamäe has a full control since 2015.
