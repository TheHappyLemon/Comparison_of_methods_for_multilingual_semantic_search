Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy FRS FRSE (UK: /kˈoʊʃi/ KOH-shee, /kˈaʊʃi / KOW-shee, US: /koʊʃˈiː / koh-SHEE, France: / ˈoɡystɛ̃ˈ  lwˈi  kˈoʃˈi /, OH-gus-TEY loo-EE KOH-SHEE; 21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857) was a French mathematician, engineer, and physicist who made pioneering contributions to several branches of mathematics, including mathematical analysis and continuum mechanics. He was one of the first to state and rigorously prove theorems of calculus, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors. He is one of the founders of complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra. A profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors; Hans Freudenthal stated: "More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy)." Cauchy was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks on a variety of topics in the fields of mathematics and mathematical physics.
