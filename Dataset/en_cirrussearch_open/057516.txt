The Singapore national ice hockey team is the national men's ice hockey team of Singapore. The team is controlled by the Singapore Ice Hockey Association and a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) since 2 May 1996. As of 28 May 2023, Singapore is currently ranked 51st in the IIHF World Ranking. Singapore made its World Championship debut in 2022, and has also played in the Challenge Cup of Asia, a regional tournament for lower-tier hockey national teams in Asia. Until the 2024 Division III Group B tournament, they are unable to participate in the IIHF World Championship tournament in 2025 due to the JCube Ice Rink (the only indoor Olympic-size ice rink in the city-state) closed in 2023, and cannot meet their minimum participation standards.
