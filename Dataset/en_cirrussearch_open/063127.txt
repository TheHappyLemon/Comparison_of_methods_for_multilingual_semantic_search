The 2022–23 La Liga, also known as La Liga Santander due to sponsorship reasons, was the 92nd season of La Liga, Spain's premier football competition. It commenced on 12 August 2022 and concluded on 4 June 2023. Real Madrid were the defending champions, having won their 35th title the previous season. On 14 May, Barcelona were confirmed as champions with four matches to spare following a 4–2 away victory against Espanyol, clinching the club's 27th league title and first since the 2018–19 season. With the 2022 FIFA World Cup having commenced on 20 November, there was a mid-season hiatus in the league. The last round before the break was held from 8–10 November, with the league resuming on 29 December. This season was the first since 2012–13 to conclude in June.
