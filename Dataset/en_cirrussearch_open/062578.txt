Meulan-en-Yvelines (French pronunciation: [mølɑ̃ ɑ̃.n‿ivlin]; formerly just Meulan) is a commune in the Yvelines department in the Île-de-France region in north-central France. It hosted part of the sailing events for the 1900 Summer Olympics held in neighbouring Paris, and would do so again 24 years later.
