Haute-Corse (French: [ot kɔʁs] ; Corsican: Corsica suprana [ˈkorsiɡa suˈprana], Cismonte [tʃiˈzmɔntɛ] or Alta Corsica; English: Upper Corsica) is a department of France, consisting of the northern part of the island of Corsica. The corresponding departmental territorial collectivity merged with that of Corse-du-Sud on 1 January 2018, forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica, with territorial elections coinciding with the dissolution of the separate councils. However, even though its administrative powers were ceded to the new territorial collectivity, it continues to remain an administrative department in its own right. In 2019, it had a population of 181,933.
