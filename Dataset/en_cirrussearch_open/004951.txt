The Langhovde Hills are an extensive area of bare rocky hills along the eastern shore of Lützow-Holm Bay, in Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. They are located just south of Hovde Bay. They were mapped by Norwegian cartographers from aerial photographs taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition (LCE) in 1936–37, and named descriptively Langhovde ("long knoll"). Many other features were mapped from surveys and air photos by the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) of 1957–62, and subsequently named by JARE Headquarters.
