One Love is the fourth studio album by French DJ David Guetta, first released in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2009 through Virgin Records. Guetta's first major international release, the album received generally favourable reviews from music critics, and was a commercial success, selling over 3 million copies globally. It spawned a total of six worldwide hit singles throughout 2009 and 2010, most notably "When Love Takes Over", featuring American recording artist Kelly Rowland, "Sexy Bitch", featuring Senegalese-American R&B singer Akon, and "Who's That Chick?", featuring Barbadian recording artist Rihanna and "One Love", featuring British recording artist Estelle. One Love is also Guetta's last studio album to feature his long-time collaborator, Chris Willis, on vocals.
