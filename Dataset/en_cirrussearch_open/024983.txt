EuroBasket 2015 was the 39th edition of the EuroBasket championship that was organized by FIBA Europe. It was co-hosted by Croatia, France, Germany, and Latvia, making it the first EuroBasket held in more than one country. It started on 5 September and ended on 20 September 2015. The top two teams (Spain and Lithuania) qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The next five teams (France, Serbia, Greece, Italy and the Czech Republic) advanced to the World Olympic Qualifying Tournaments. Latvia and Croatia later qualified due to Serbia and Italy hosting two of the Olympic qualifying tournaments while Turkey also qualified as an invitee. Spain won their third title by defeating Lithuania 80–63 in the final. France won bronze on home soil defeating Serbia (81–68). The final game was held in the Stade Pierre-Mauroy and set a new record for the highest attendance in a EuroBasket game, with 26,922. Pau Gasol was named the tournament's MVP.
