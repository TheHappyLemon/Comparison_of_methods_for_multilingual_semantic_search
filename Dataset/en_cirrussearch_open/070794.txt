The Armenian Wikipedia (Armenian: Վիքիպեդիա or Վիքիպեդիա Ազատ Հանրագիտարան, romanized: Vikipedia or Vikipedia Azat Hanragitaran; Western Armenian: Ուիքիփետիա) is the Armenian language version of Wikipedia. It was created in February 2003 as Հայերեն Վիքիփեդիա, but started developing in 2005.[attribution needed] The name was changed to Հայերեն Վիքիպեդիա on 5 April 2012. With all of its current content, it is listed in List of Wikipedias in the 100,000+ category. Armenian Wikipedia launched later the option of reading all contents, if preferred, in traditional (Mesrobian) orthography, rather than the Reformed (Abeghian) orthography. Armenian Wikipedia also carried at times parallel articles in Western Armenian language spoken widely in the Armenian diaspora. On 1 April 2019 however, a separate site was launched in Western Armenian under the name Հայերէն Ուիքիփետիա with a project of moving Western Armenian materials there and expanding content in the new Western Armenian Wikipedia space.
