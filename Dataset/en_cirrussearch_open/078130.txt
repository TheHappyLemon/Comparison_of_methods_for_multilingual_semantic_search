The Slip is the seventh studio album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released on May 5, 2008, digitally on the Nine Inch Nails website, and on CD on July 22 by The Null Corporation. It was their second release in 2008, following their sixth album Ghosts I–IV, released two months prior. The album was produced by frontman Trent Reznor with collaborators Atticus Ross and Alan Moulder. Although originally intended to be an EP, the project was later expanded into a full length album. Recording took place over the span of three weeks, and is described by Reznor as simply "garage electronics". Like Ghosts, the record was released under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA) license via the band's website for no-cost, with a limited-edition physical version following two months later. The album's only single, "Discipline", was distributed by Reznor to radio stations less than 24 hours after it was mastered by Moulder. The Slip was well received by critics, with particular praise towards its production and unorthodox method of release. The album reached number 13 on the Billboard 200, while the digital release was downloaded nearly 2 million times.
