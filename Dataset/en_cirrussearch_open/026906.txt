Cres (Croatian pronunciation: [t͡srês]; Dalmatian: Crepsa, Venetian: Cherso, Italian: Cherso, Latin: Crepsa, Greek: Χέρσος) is an Adriatic island in Croatia. It is one of the northern islands in the Kvarner Gulf and can be reached via ferry from Rijeka, Krk island or from the Istrian peninsula (line Brestova-Porozina). With an area of 405.78 square kilometres (156.67 sq mi), Cres has the same size as the neighbouring Krk island.[citation needed] In 2011, Cres had a population of 3,079 people. In the past,[when?] Cres and the neighbouring island of Lošinj used to be one island, but now they are divided by a channel and connected by a bridge that starts from the town of Osor. Cres's only freshwater source is Lake Vrana.
