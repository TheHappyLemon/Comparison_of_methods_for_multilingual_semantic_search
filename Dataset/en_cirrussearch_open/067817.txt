The Republicans (French: Les Républicains [le ʁepyblikɛ̃]; LR) is a liberal-conservative political party in France, largely inspired by the tradition of Gaullism. The party was formed on 30 May 2015 as the re-incorporation of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), which had been established in 2002 under the leadership of then President of France Jacques Chirac. LR, as previously the UMP, used to be one of the two major political parties in the French Fifth Republic along with the centre-left Socialist Party, before being eclipsed by the National Rally and Renaissance. LR's candidate in the 2017 presidential election, former Prime Minister François Fillon, placed third in the first round, with 20.0% of the vote. Following the 2017 legislative election, LR became the second-largest party in the National Assembly, behind President Emmanuel Macron's La République En Marche! party. After the disappointing result in the 2019 European Parliament election, party leader Laurent Wauquiez resigned. He was replaced by Christian Jacob, who remained in office until after the 2022 legislative election, which saw LR lose half of its seats, although becoming the kingmaker in a hung parliament. One month before, in the 2022 presidential election, LR nominee Valérie Pécresse placed fifth with 4.7% of the vote. Éric Ciotti became president of LR after the 2022 leadership election. Despite these setbacks, LR is still the largest party in the Senate and heads a plurality of regions of France. LR is a member of the European People's Party (EPP) and the Centrist Democrat International (CDI).
