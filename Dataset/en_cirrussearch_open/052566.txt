Lake Hévíz is located in Hévíz, Hungary, near the western end of Lake Balaton, 8 kilometres (5 mi) from Keszthely. It is the largest swimmable thermal lake in the world (47,500 square metres (511,286 sq ft) in area), second only to Frying Pan Lake in New Zealand, which is too hot for swimming. The flow of water is very strong and the water in the lake is completely replenished every 72 hours. Its minimum depth is 2 meters, reaching a maximum depth of 38 meters, exactly at the point where the hot thermal water comes out to the surface.
