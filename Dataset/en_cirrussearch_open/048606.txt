Vereniging Betaald Voetbal De Graafschap, simply known as De Graafschap (Dutch pronunciation: [də ˈɣraːfsxɑp]) is a professional association football club based in Doetinchem, Netherlands. The team competes in the Eerste Divisie, the second level of the Dutch football league system. Founded on 1 February 1954, the club has played its home games at De Vijverberg since their foundation. Translated from Dutch, the club name means "The County", while its fans are affectionately referred to as Superboeren ("Super Farmers"). The club dons blue and white hooped shirts paired with white shorts and blue socks. Though modest in stature compared to some European counterparts, De Graafschap has maintained a consistent presence in the top-tier Eredivisie, albeit without clinching any major trophies. Despite this, the club boasts a substantial stadium and a dedicated fan base, particularly notable within the second-tier Eerste Divisie. Over time, the club has cultivated heated rivalries, notably with Vitesse. However, circumstances have also fueled a burgeoning rivalry with Go Ahead Eagles.
