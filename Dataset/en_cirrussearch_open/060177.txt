The women's snowboard cross competition in snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 9 February, at the Genting Snow Park in Zhangjiakou. Lindsey Jacobellis of the United States became the Olympic champion. Jacobellis dominated the snowboard cross for almost two decades, winning the X Games ten times and the world championships six times, but her only Olympic medal so far was the silver in 2006, when she started celebrating her win too early and was overtaken at the finish line. Chloé Trespeuch of France, the 2014 bronze medalist, won the silver medal, and Meryeta O'Dine of Canada the bronze, her first Olympic medal. In the victory ceremony, the medals were presented by Pál Schmitt, IOC Member, Hungary, Olympian, 2 Golds for Fencing 1968 and Fencing 1972, accompanied by Johan Eliasch, FIS President, Great Britain.
