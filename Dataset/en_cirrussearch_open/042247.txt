Geocoris pallens, the western big-eyed bug, is a species of big-eyed bug in the family Geocoridae. It is found in Central America, North America, and Oceania. These insects are carnivorious and feed on aphids, leafhoppers and seed bugs, which makes them vital for pest control, and both adults and young are predatory. Adults are active from spring to summer.
