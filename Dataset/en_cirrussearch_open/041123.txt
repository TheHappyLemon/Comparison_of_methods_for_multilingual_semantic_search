Divock Okoth Origi (born 18 April 1995) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Nottingham Forest, on loan from Serie A club AC Milan, and the Belgium national team. Origi began his career at Lille, and scored on his professional debut for them in 2013. A year and a half later, he was signed for £10 million by Premier League club Liverpool, who loaned him back to Lille for the 2014–15 Ligue 1 season. After struggling at Liverpool due to injuries, and spending a year on loan at VfL Wolfsburg, Origi made various crucial contributions to the club during the 2018–19 season. Most notably, he scored two goals, including the winning goal, in the 2019 Champions League semi-final comeback against Barcelona, as well as scoring in the final of the same Champions League season against Tottenham, resulting in Liverpool's latest Champions League trophy. He was also a part of the squad that won the 2019–20 Premier League the following season, Liverpool's first league title for 30 years. Origi made his international debut for Belgium in 2014 and was part of their team which reached the quarter-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, during which he became the youngest goalscorer in Belgian World Cup history as a 19 year old.
