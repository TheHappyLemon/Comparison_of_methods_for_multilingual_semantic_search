The Uzbek Khanate (Uzbek: Oʻzbek xonligi or Oʻzbek ulusi / Ўзбек хонлиги or Ўзбек Улуси), also known as the Abulkhair Khanate was a Shaybanid state preceding the Khanate of Bukhara. During the few years it existed, the Uzbek Khanate was the preeminent state in Central Asia, ruling over most of modern-day Uzbekistan, much of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and parts of southern Russia. This is the first state of the Abulkhairids, a branch of the Shaybanids.
