Rafael Tolói Cavaliere OMRI (born 10 October 1990) is a professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Serie A club Atalanta and the Italy national team. Tolói represented his native country of Brazil internationally at the under-20 level in 2009, but switched allegiance at the senior grade to Italy in 2021 after meeting FIFA's five-year residency requirement. He had been living in Italy since his move to Atalanta early in the 2015–16 season, and had years earlier acquired Italian citizenship, for which he was eligible because his great grandparents hailed from Treviso, Veneto. He made his senior debut for Italy in 2021, and represented the nation at their victorious UEFA Euro 2020 campaign.
