Neoboletus luridiformis, also previously known as Boletus luridiformis and (invalidly) as Boletus erythropus, is a fungus of the bolete family, all of which produce mushrooms with tubes and pores beneath their caps. It is found in Northern Europe and North America, and is commonly known as the scarletina bolete, for its red pores, which are yellow when young. Other common names include the red foot bolete, dotted stemmed bolete, or dotted stem bolete. Whilst edible when cooked properly, it can cause gastric stomach problems if raw. Where the two species coincide, it can be confused with the poisonous Rubroboletus satanas, which causes gastrointestinal distress.
