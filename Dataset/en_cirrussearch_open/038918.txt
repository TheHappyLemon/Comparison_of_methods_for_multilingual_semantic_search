Maithili (English: /ˈmaɪtɪli/) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in parts of India and Nepal. It is native to the Mithila region, which encompasses parts of the Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand as well as the Nepalese Koshi and Madhesh Provinces. It is one of the 22 official languages of India. It is the second most commonly spoken language of Nepal. It is also one of the fourteen provincial official languages of Nepal. The language is predominantly written in Devanagari, but the historical Tirhuta and Kaithi scripts retained some use until today.
