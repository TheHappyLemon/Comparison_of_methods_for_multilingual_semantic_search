The Tour of Estonia is a road bicycle racing stage race held in Estonia. The race is organised as a 2.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour. The race was created by amalgamating two existing one-day races in Estonia that traditionally took place during the same weekend in early summer, Tallinnâ€“Tartu GP, and Tartu GP. These two races now make up the first and second stage, respectively.
