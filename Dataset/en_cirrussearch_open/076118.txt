Shrikes (/ʃraɪk/) are passerine birds of the family Laniidae. The family is composed of 34 species in two genera. The family name, and that of the largest genus, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for "butcher", and some shrikes are also known as butcherbirds because of the habit, particularly of males, of impaling prey onto plant spines within their territories. These larders have multiple functions, attracting females and serving as food stores. The common English name shrike is from Old English scrīc, alluding to the shrike's shriek-like call.
