Enschede (Dutch: [ˈɛnsxədeː] ; known as Eanske [ˈɛːnskə] in the local Tweants dialect of Low Saxon) is a city and municipality in the province of Overijssel. It is located in the Twente region of the eastern Netherlands. The east of the urban area reaches the border of the German city of Gronau. The municipality of Enschede consisted only of the city of Enschede until 1935, when the rural municipality of Lonneker, which surrounded the city, was annexed after the rapid industrial expansion of Enschede that began in the 1860s and involved the building of railways and the digging of the Twentekanaal. Enschede is home to the football club FC Twente, a one-time Dutch champion; the University of Twente; and the last Polaroid film factory. During the Carnival festivities, which take place in February or March, Enschede is temporarily renamed as Krekkelstad, which means "cricket town" in English.
