For UEFA Euro 2016, the 24 participating national teams had to submit squads of 23 players – of which three had to be goalkeepers – by 31 May 2016, 10 days prior to the opening match of the tournament. In the event that a player on the submitted squad list suffered an injury or illness prior to his team's first match of the tournament, that player could be replaced, provided that the team doctor and a doctor from the UEFA Medical Committee both confirmed that the injury or illness is severe enough to prevent the player's participation in the tournament. The age listed for each player is on 10 June 2016, the first day of the tournament. The number of caps listed for each player does not include any matches played after the start of UEFA Euro 2016. The club listed is the club for which the player last played a competitive match prior to the tournament. The nationality for each club reflects the national association (not the league) to which the club is affiliated.
