Joseph Frank "Buster" Keaton (October 4, 1895 â€“ February 1, 1966) was an American actor, comedian and film director. He is best known for his silent films during the 1920s, in which he performed physical comedy and stunts with a stoic, deadpan expression that became his trademark and earned him the nickname "The Great Stone Face". Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton's "extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929" when he "worked without interruption" as having made him "the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies". In 1996, Entertainment Weekly recognized Keaton as the seventh-greatest film director. and in 1999 the American Film Institute ranked him as the 21st-greatest male star of classic Hollywood cinema. Keaton was a child vaudeville star, performing as part of his family's act. As an adult, he began working with independent producer Joseph M. Schenck and filmmaker Edward F. Cline, with whom he made a series of successful two-reel comedies in the early 1920s, including One Week (1920), The Playhouse (1921), Cops (1922), and The Electric House (1922). He then moved to feature-length films; several of them, such as Sherlock Jr. (1924), The General (1926), and The Cameraman (1928), remain highly regarded. The General is widely viewed as his masterpiece: Orson Welles considered it "the greatest comedy ever made...and perhaps the greatest film ever made". Keaton's career declined after 1928, when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and lost his artistic independence. His wife divorced him, and he descended into alcoholism. He recovered in the 1940s, remarried, and revived his career as an honored comic performer, earning an Academy Honorary Award in 1959. During this period, he made cameos in Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (1950), Chaplin's Limelight (1952), Samuel Beckett's Film (1965) and the Twilight Zone episode "Once Upon a Time" (1961).
