Vana Tallinn (Literal translation: "Old Tallinn") is an Estonian brand of liqueur manufactured continuously by Liviko since 1960. The recipe contains Jamaican rum and a variety of herbs and spices. Vana Tallinn is typically served on the rocks but may also be used for cocktails, food, coffee or mulled wine.[citation needed]
