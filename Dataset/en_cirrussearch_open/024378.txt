2C-B (4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine) is a synthetic psychedelic drug of the 2C family, mainly used as a recreational drug. The substance was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974, and gained an initial reputation for potential psychotherapeutic use, but its use has been limited to mainly recreational use. To date, there is limited scientific information regarding the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects in humans. The existing studies primarily classify 2C-B as a stimulant, and hallucinogen, and less commonly as an entactogen, and empathogen. 2C-B, also referred to by a number of slang names, is known to circulate in the illicit market in multiple forms. Most commonly found in a powder form, less commonly in capsules or pills. For recreational use, the substance is generally consumed orally or nasally. In Shulgin's book PiHKAL, the dosage range is listed as 12â€“24 mg.
