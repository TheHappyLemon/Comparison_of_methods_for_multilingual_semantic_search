Common names: Mauritius snakes, Round Island boas, splitjaw snakes. The Bolyeriidae are a family of snakes native to Mauritius and a few islands around it, especially Round Island. They also used to be found on the island of Mauritius, but were extirpated there due to human influence and foraging pigs in particular. These snakes used to be placed in the Boidae, but are now classed as a separate family. Two monotypic genera are recognized, but only a single species is extant (not extinct). Bolyeriidae appear to be most closely related to the Asian genus Xenophidion.
