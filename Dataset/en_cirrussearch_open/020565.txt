Mozzarella (English: /ˌmɒtsəˈrɛlə/, Italian: [mottsaˈrɛlla]; also Neapolitan: muzzarella [muttsaˈrɛllə]) is a semi-soft non-aged cheese prepared by the pasta filata method with origins from southern Italy. It is prepared with cow's milk or buffalo milk, taking the following names: "Mozzarella fior di latte" or "mozzarella": cow's milk; "Mozzarella di bufala": Italian buffalo's milk. Fresh mozzarella is generally white but when seasoned it turns to a light yellow depending on the animal's diet. Due to its high moisture content, it is traditionally served the day after it is made but can be kept in brine for up to a week or longer when sold in vacuum-sealed packages. Fresh mozzarella can be heard to make a distinct squeaky sound when it is chewed or rubbed. Low-moisture mozzarella can be kept refrigerated for up to a month, though some shredded low-moisture mozzarella is sold with a shelf life of up to six months. Mozzarella is used for most types of pizza and several pasta dishes or served with sliced tomatoes and basil in Caprese salad.
