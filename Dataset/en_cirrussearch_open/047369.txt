Funny People is a 2009 American black comedy-drama film written and directed by Judd Apatow, co-produced by Apatow Productions and Madison 23 Productions, and starring Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Leslie Mann with Eric Bana, Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman in supporting roles. The film follows a famous comedian who is diagnosed with a terminal disease and tries to fix the relationships in his life while befriending an aspiring comedian. The film was released on July 31, 2009. It received generally positive reviews with particular praise for the performances, but also criticism for its runtime. However, the film was a box-office bomb, grossing $71 million against its $75 million budget, and was the final film produced by Madison 23, as Sandler retired the label after its release.
