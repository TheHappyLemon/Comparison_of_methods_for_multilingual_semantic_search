The 1900 Olympic Croquet two-ball singles tournament was held on 4 and 11 July 1900. Eight athletes from France competed. The event was won by Chr√©tien Waydelich, the only person to earn two singles medals in Olympic croquet (with a bronze in the one-ball competition as well). Silver went to Maurice Vignerot and bronze to Jacques Sautereau.
