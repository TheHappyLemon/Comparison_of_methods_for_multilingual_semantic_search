The Schwielochsee is a lake in Lower Lusatia, the south-eastern part of Brandenburg, eastern Germany. Its area is 13.3 km2 (5.1 sq mi), so it's the largest lake in this area. It is fed and drained by the river Spree. The Spree flows in from the west and leaves the lake to the north in the direction of Beeskow. Part of the lake lies within the territory of the municipality Schwielochsee, that was named after the lake.
