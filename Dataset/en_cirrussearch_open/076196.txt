Married... with Children is an American television sitcom created by Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Originally broadcast from April 5, 1987, to June 9, 1997, it is the longest-running live-action sitcom ever aired on Fox. Married... with Children was the first primetime series broadcast on the new Fox network. The series's run ended with the episode broadcast on May 5, 1997. Two previously unaired episodes were broadcast on June 9, 1997 and June 18, 2002. Set in Chicago, the show follows the lives of Al Bundy, a former high school football player turned hard-luck women's shoe salesman; his lazy wife, Peggy; their pretty but dim-witted daughter, Kelly; and their smart-aleck son, Bud. The show also features their neighbors, the stuffy Steve and Marcy Rhoades, both of whom Al finds annoying, but the Rhoades feel the same way about Al. Later in the series, Marcy marries Jefferson D'Arcy, a white-collar criminal who becomes her "trophy husband" and Al's sidekick. The series is one of the longest running sitcoms in American television history, comprising eleven seasons with 259 episodes in its run. Its theme song is "Love and Marriage" by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, performed by Frank Sinatra from the 1955 television production Our Town. The first two seasons of the series were videotaped at ABC Television Center in Hollywood. Seasons 3 to 8 were taped at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, and the final three seasons were taped at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. The series was initially produced by Embassy Communications. Starting halfway through the second season, the series was produced by ELP Communications under the studio Columbia Pictures Television. In 2008, the show made the top 100 on Entertainment Weekly's "New TV Classics" list, placing number 94. In May 2022, an animated revival of the series was in the works.
