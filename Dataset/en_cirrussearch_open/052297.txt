Głogów ([ˈɡwɔɡuf] ; German: Glogau, rarely Groß-Glogau, Czech: Hlohov, Silesian: Głogōw) is a city in western Poland. It is the county seat of Głogów County, in Lower Silesian Voivodeship. Głogów is the sixth largest town in the Voivodeship; its population in 2021 was 65,400. The name of the town derives from głóg, the Polish name for hawthorn. Among the oldest towns in Poland, Głogów was founded in the 10th century as a Piast defensive settlement and obtained city rights in the 13th century from Duke Konrad I. Due to the town's strategic location on several trade routes, the townspeople received many privileges and benefits, which brought wealth and greatly reflected on the city's architecture. Over time, Głogów grew to be one of the largest fortified towns in Lower Silesia. The demolition of fortifications at the beginning of the 20th century improved the chances for further growth. However, towards the end of the Second World War Głogów was once again turned into a defensive fortress and as such suffered almost complete destruction. Currently reconstruction works are being carried out with the aim of restoring the historic pre-war appearance of the town. The castle, which was rebuilt between 1971 and 1983, now houses the Historical and Archaeological Museum, displaying artifacts such as Lusatian burial artifacts from Wróblin Głogowski. Since 1984 the town also has been the venue for the Głogów Jazz Festival, which features local and international singers, musicians and performers.
