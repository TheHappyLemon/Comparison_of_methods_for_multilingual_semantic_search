The Jewish Autonomous Oblast is the only Autonomous Oblast in Russia. It is situated in the Far Eastern Federal District of Russia. Its flag consists of a rainbow on a white background, with seven narrow horizontal colored stripes: red, orange, yellow, green, sky blue, blue and purple. The colors are slightly different from the basic spectral colors, with gold in place of yellow, vivid blue instead of light blue, and indigo as dark blue, The number of colors is meant to symbolize the seven-branched Jewish Menorah. The flag's aspect ratio is 2:3. The seven colored stripes are centered vertically and regularly spaced; they have a height each equal to 1⁄40 of the flag's height, and are separated by thin spacing (white borders) equal to 1⁄120 of the flag's height. The rainbow flag design was adopted in 27 October 1996.
