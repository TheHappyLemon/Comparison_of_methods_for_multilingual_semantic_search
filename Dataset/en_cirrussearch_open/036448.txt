Trochetia is a genus of flowering plants from the family Malvaceae (formerly in the Sterculiaceae, but this family is now usually subsumed in the Malvaceae). They are endemic to the Mascarene Islands. The genus was first described by A.P. de Candolle in 1823, who named it in honour of French botanist Henri Dutrochet.
