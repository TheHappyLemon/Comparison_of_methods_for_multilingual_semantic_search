Courland is one of the Historical Latvian Lands in western Latvia. Courland's largest city is Liepāja, which is the third largest city in Latvia. The regions of Semigallia and Selonia are sometimes considered as part of Courland[citation needed] as they were formerly held by the same duke. The literal meaning of the name is "Land of Curonians".
