Corse-du-Sud (French pronunciation: [kɔʁs dy syd] ; Corsican: Corsica suttana [ˈkorsiga sutˈtana], Pumonte [puˈmɔntɛ] or Pumonti [puˈmɔnti]; English: Southern Corsica) is (as of 2019) an administrative department of France, consisting of the southern part of the island of Corsica. The corresponding departmental territorial collectivity merged with that of Haute-Corse on 1 January 2018, forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica, with territorial elections coinciding with the dissolution of the separate council. Although its administrative powers were ceded to the new territorial collectivity, it continues to remain an administrative department in its own right. In 2019, it had a population of 158,507.
