The Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. F, also known as VK 18.01, was a German light tank from World War II. Despite the fact that it was designated as a modification of the light tank Panzer I, the VK.18.01 was a completely new vehicle, had almost nothing to do with it.[citation needed] The Pz.Kpfw.I Ausf.F was created in 1942 as a light tank designed to storm fortified lines. In that same year, 30 units were produced (No. 150301-150330). From 1943 it was used for anti-guerrilla operations on the Eastern Front and in Yugoslavia. Thirty Ausf F tanks were built between April and December 1942, eight of which were sent to the Eastern Front for evaluation. The Pz.Kpfw.I Ausf.F was almost the same as the Panzer II Ausf. J in terms of armor, which itself did not enter serial production.
