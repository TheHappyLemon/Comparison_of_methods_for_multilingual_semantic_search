Robert Lee Parish (born August 30, 1953) is an American former professional basketball player. A 7'1" center, Parish played for four teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1976 to 1997. During his 14-year tenure with the Boston Celtics, Parish teamed with Hall-of-Fame forwards Larry Bird and Kevin McHale to form one of the greatest front lines in NBA history. During his college career at Centenary College, Parish racked up impressive enough numbers to be drafted three times--twice by teams from the ABA, and once in 1976 by the Golden State Warriors of the NBA. Parish played four seasons for the Warriors. In 1980, he was traded to the Boston Celtics along with a draft pick that the Celtics would use to select forward Kevin McHale. Parish and McHale joined star forward Larry Bird on the Celtics. Known as the Big Three, the trio won three NBA championships together. Parish left the Celtics as a free agent following the 1993â€“1994 season. He went on to play two more seasons with the Charlotte Hornets and one with the Chicago Bulls, winning an NBA championship with the Bulls in 1997 before retiring from the NBA at age 43. Parish played an NBA-record 1,611 games in his career. He played in 21 NBA seasons, tied for second-most in league history. Aside from his career longevity, Parish is known for his strong defense, rebounding, and high-trajectory jump shot. He is a nine-time NBA All-Star and a four-time NBA champion, and he was named to the NBA's 50th and 75th anniversary teams. The Celtics retired his jersey in 1998. Parish was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2003.
