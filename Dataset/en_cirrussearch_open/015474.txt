The Daugavpils International Airport (Latvian: Daugavpils Starptautiskā Lidosta) was located 12 km northeast of Daugavpils in the village of Lociki, Naujene Parish, Augšdaugava Municipality, in the Latgale region of Latvia. All of the airport's technical infrastructure, runway and buildings are what was left of the former Soviet military air base. The base was completely abandoned in 1993. Since 2005 the city council had sought to promote plans to redevelop it, but it was not able to obtain funding. In 2021, Municipality voted to terminate activities of the Airport and start liquidation of the assets. One of the transition plans involves creating an industrial park on the territory.
