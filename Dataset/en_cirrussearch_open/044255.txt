Aldis Gobzems (born October 10, 1978) is a Latvian politician and lawyer. He first rose to prominence as a lawyer who represented victims of the 2013 Zolitūde shopping centre roof collapse, and was the prime ministerial candidate for the Who Owns the State? party in the 2018 Latvian parliamentary elections. After being elected into parliament, Gobzems was nominated by President Raimonds Vējonis on November 26, 2018, to attempt to form and lead a new government by becoming Prime Minister of Latvia, but his nomination was revoked on December 10 after negotiations with other parties failed. After an increasingly public dispute with fellow Who Owns the State? leader Artuss Kaimiņš, he was expelled from the party on February 4, 2019. He has commonly been described as a populist by media, while he has described his former party as part of a "right-of-center bloc".
