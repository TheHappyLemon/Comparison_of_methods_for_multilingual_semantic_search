Luís André de Pina Cabral e Villas-Boas (Portuguese pronunciation: [luˈiz ɐ̃ˈdɾɛ ðɨ ˈpinɐ kɐˈβɾal i ˈvilɐʒ ˈβoɐʃ]; born 17 October 1977) is a Portuguese football manager. He is one of a growing number of top-level managers who have never played football professionally and one of the few managers to have never played beyond youth football. Highlights in his career include an undefeated 2010–11 season in the Primeira Liga with Porto, winning four trophies and becoming the youngest manager ever to win a European title in the process, helping Tottenham to their then-record tally of 72 points in the Premier League during the 2012–13 season (the highest points for a team to finish outside the top four at the time) and three trophies during his spell with Zenit, achieving the fifth league title in the club's history.
