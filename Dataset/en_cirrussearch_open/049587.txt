The Chile women's national football team represents Chile in international women's football. It is administered by the Federación de Fútbol de Chile and is a member of CONMEBOL. Chile were close to qualification for the FIFA Women's World Cup in 1991, 1995 and 2011 and later finally made the Finals for the first time in 2019. Chile is, along with Brazil, one of the two teams to never fail to qualify for the Copa América Femenina. Chile's friendlies are frequently played against Argentina, who is a traditional rival. The team is currently coached by José Letelier and is captained by goalkeeper Christiane Endler. As well as many South American nations, women's football is somewhat under shadow of men's football. Chile, for qualifying to the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France, marked itself as the fifth nation in the CONMEBOL to have both men's and women's teams qualify for senior FIFA tournaments. Chile is one of only three Spanish-speaking countries to have won a game in the Women's World Cup. Chile women's national football team qualified for its first Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020.
