Albert Leo Schlageter ([ˈalbɛʁt ˈleːo ˈʃlaːɡɛtɐ]; August 12, 1894 – May 26, 1923) was a German military officer who joined a right-wing Freikorps group after World War I and became famous for acts of post-war sabotage against French occupational forces. Schlageter was arrested for sabotaging a section of railroad track and executed by the French military. The manner of his death fostered an aura of martyrdom around him, which was cultivated by German nationalist groups, in particular the Nazi Party. In Nazi Germany, he was commemorated as a national hero.
