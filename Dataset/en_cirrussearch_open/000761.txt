The "Horst-Wessel-Lied" ("Horst Wessel Song"; German: [hɔʁst ˈvɛsl̩ liːt] ), also known by its opening words "Die Fahne hoch" ("Raise the flag", lit. 'The flag high'), was the anthem of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) from 1930 to 1945. From 1933 to 1945, the Nazis made it the de-facto co-national anthem of Nazi Germany, along with the first stanza of the "Deutschlandlied". The "Horst-Wessel-Lied" has been banned in Germany and Austria since the end of World War II.
