A Hopfield network (Ising model of a neural network or Ising–Lenz–Little model or Amari-Little-Hopfield network) is a spin glass system used to model neural networks, based on Ernst Ising's work with Wilhelm Lenz on the Ising model of magnetic materials. Hopfield networks were first described with respect to recurrent neural networks by Shun'ichi Amari in 1972 and with respect to biological neural networks by William Little in 1974, and were popularised by John Hopfield in 1982. Hopfield networks serve as content-addressable ("associative") memory systems with binary threshold nodes, or with continuous variables. Hopfield networks also provide a model for understanding human memory.
