Hati /ˈhɑːti/ or Saturn XLIII is a natural satellite of Saturn. Its discovery was announced by Scott S. Sheppard, David C. Jewitt, Jan Kleyna, and Brian G. Marsden on 4 May 2005, from observations taken between 12 December 2004 and 11 March 2005. Hati is about 5 kilometers in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 19,697 Mm in 1040 days, at an inclination of 164° to the ecliptic, in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.375, somewhat similar to Mundilfari's orbit. In March 2013, the synodic rotational period was measured by Cassini to about 5.45±0.04 hours. This is the fastest known rotation of all of Saturn's moons, and in fact the fastest known among all moons (including asteroid moons) for which a rotation period has been reliably measured. Like Mundilfari, it is very elongated in shape. It was named in April 2007 after Hati, a giant wolf from Norse mythology, son of Fenrisúlfr and twin brother of Sköll.
