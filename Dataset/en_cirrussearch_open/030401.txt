The Audi 100 and Audi 200 (and sometimes called Audi 5000 in North America) are primarily mid-size/executive cars manufactured and marketed by the Audi division of the Volkswagen Group. The car was made from 1968 to 1997 across four generations (C1–C4), with a two-door model available in the first and second generation (C1-C2), and a five-door model available in the last three generations (C2–C4). In 1982, the third generation Audi 100 achieved a remarkably low (for its time) drag coefficient of 0.30, featuring flush greenhouse sides with unique sliding window mountings. The C2 and C3 models of the Audi 100 were marketed in North America as the Audi 5000 from 1978 to 1988, and in South Africa as the Audi 500. In 1993, the models were mildly restyled, and renamed the Audi A6 series in conjunction with a general new Audi naming scheme, until they were replaced by a new generation of A6, internally code-named C5, in 1997. The Audi 100's traditional competitors include the Mercedes Benz E-Class and BMW 5-Series.
