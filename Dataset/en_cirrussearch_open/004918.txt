The Baltic Klint (Clint, Glint; Estonian: Balti klint, Swedish: Baltiska klinten, Russian: Балтийско-Ладожский уступ, Глинт) is an erosional limestone escarpment and cuesta on several islands of the Baltic Sea, in Estonia, in Leningrad Oblast of Russia and in the islands of Gotland and Öland of Sweden. It was featured on the reverse of the 50 krooni note of 1928 and on the 100 krooni note of 1992. The Baltic Klint is active landform showing some retreat in the present. However it is not known to which degree the Baltic Klint originated in postglacial time or if it evolved from cliff-like forms sculpted by the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet. In Gotland 20th century cliff retreat rates have been estimated at 0.15 to 0.78 cm/year. Retreat of the Baltic Klint in Gotland has widened shore platforms.
