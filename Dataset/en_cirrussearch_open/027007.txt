Simeon Ivanovich (Russian: Симеон Иванович; 7 September 1317 – 27 April 1353), also known as Semyon Ivanovich (Russian: Семён Иванович), nicknamed the Proud (Russian: Гордый, romanized: Gordy), was Prince of Moscow and Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1340 to 1353. The son of Ivan I, Simeon continued his father's policies aimed to increase the power and prestige of his state. Simeon's rule was marked by regular military and political standoffs against the Novgorod Republic and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His relationships with neighboring Russian principalities remained peaceful if not passive: Simeon stayed aside from conflicts between subordinate princes. He had recourse to war only when war was unavoidable. His reign marked a relatively quiet period for Moscow ended by the Black Death that claimed the lives of Simeon and his sons in 1353.
