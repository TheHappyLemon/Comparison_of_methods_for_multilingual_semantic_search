Fussball Club Vaduz (Football Club Vaduz) is a professional football club from Vaduz, Liechtenstein that plays in the Swiss Challenge League. The club plays at the national Rheinpark Stadion, which has a capacity of 5,873 when all are seated but has additional standing places in the North and South ends of the ground, giving a total stadium capacity of 7,838. They currently play in the Swiss Challenge League following relegation from the Swiss Super League after the 2020â€“21 season. Vaduz is unique in that it represents its own national association in the UEFA Europa Conference League when winning the domestic cup, whilst playing in another country's league. This is due to Liechtenstein not organising its own league. Vaduz has historically had many players from Liechtenstein, many of whom have played for the Liechtenstein national team, but nearly all these players have moved abroad, and now the majority of the first team squad are foreign players from different areas of the world. On 25 August 2022, after beating Rapid Wien away in Austria, Vaduz made history by qualifying for the Europa Conference League group stage, becoming the first ever club from Liechtenstein to reach the group stages of a UEFA club competition.
