Komló ([komloː], German: Kumlau, Croatian: Komlov) is a town in Baranya county, Hungary. The name of the settlement is derived from the local crop of hops (komló), an ingredient of beer. By the 18th century a depiction of this plant running up a support already featured on the herald of the town. The former village of Komló became a planned mining city during the socialist era. It was the second biggest mining centre in Hungary after Tatabánya.
