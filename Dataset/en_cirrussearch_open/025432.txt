The close back unrounded vowel, or high back unrounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is ⟨ɯ⟩. Typographically, it is a turned letter ⟨m⟩; given its relation to the sound represented by the letter ⟨u⟩, it can be considered a ⟨u⟩ with an extra "bowl". The close back unrounded vowel can in many cases be considered the vocalic equivalent of the voiced velar approximant [ɰ].
