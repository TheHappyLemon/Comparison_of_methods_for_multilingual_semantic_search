Nathan Russell Horton (born May 29, 1985) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. During his career, Horton played for the Florida Panthers, Boston Bruins and Columbus Blue Jackets. He was drafted third overall by the Panthers in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. He won the Stanley Cup in 2011 with the Bruins. Horton's last NHL game came in April 2014 due to a back injury. Though he did not officially retire, the surgery required to fix Horton's back would have ended his career regardless.
