Operation Winterzauber (also translated into English as Operation Winter Magic) was an anti-partisan operation from 15 February to 30 March 1943 aimed at creating a depopulated zone of 30–40 km (19–25 mi) along the Belarusian–Latvian border. It was mainly conducted by Latvian collaborators under German command in northern Belarus and in Sebezhsky District in Russia. In the Soviet Union, the operation became known as the Osveya Tragedy. The Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation has described Operation Winterzauber as a crime against humanity.
