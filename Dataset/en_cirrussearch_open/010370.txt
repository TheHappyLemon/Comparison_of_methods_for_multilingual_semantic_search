The Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2012 was the tenth edition of the annual Junior Eurovision Song Contest. It took place at the Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands on 1 December 2012. Dutch broadcaster AVRO was the host broadcaster for the event. For the second time the Netherlands hosted the contest, after hosting the contest in 2007 in Rotterdam. The show was hosted by Kim-Lian van der Meij for a second time, this time joined by Ewout Genemans. The motto for the contest was "Break The Ice". Twelve countries took part in the contest, making it the smallest number of countries participating in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest history, and equalling the number of countries participated in the 1970 Eurovision Song Contest held at RAI Congrescentrum. Albania and Azerbaijan, and Israel made their debuts at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. Whilst nine countries from the previous edition continued their participation in the contest, four countries withdrew: Lithuania, Bulgaria, Latvia and Macedonia. The contest was won by Anastasiya Petryk for Ukraine with the song "Nebo". Georgia and Armenia finished in second and third place, respectively. This was Ukraine's first Junior Eurovision victory and second Eurovision victory after Ruslana won the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest in Istanbul. Ukraine's winning margin of 35 points was also a record.
