The 1900 Olympic Croquet doubles tournament was held on 22 July 1900. Gaston Aumoitte and Georges Johin, who had taken first and second in the singles one-ball event, were the winning pair: very little else is known about the event, including the competition format or if any other doubles teams entered.
