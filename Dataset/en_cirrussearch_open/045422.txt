Estonia competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. It was the last time that Estonia competed at the Summer Games as an independent nation until the 1992 Summer Olympics. After the nation was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, a number of Estonian athletes competed as part of the USSR delegations at the Summer Olympic games from 1952 to 1988.
