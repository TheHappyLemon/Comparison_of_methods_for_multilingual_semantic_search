North Macedonia has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 21 times since its official debut in 1998. The country had attempted to participate in 1996, but failed to qualify from the audio-only qualifying round. The current Head of Delegation is Meri Popova. Prior to 2019, North Macedonia's best result was a 12th-place finish with Elena Risteska in 2006. Having qualified from the semi-final round only once in ten of the previous eleven contests (2008â€“18), North Macedonia achieved its best result to date in 2019, when Tamara Todevska qualified and finished in seventh place in the final after winning the jury vote.
