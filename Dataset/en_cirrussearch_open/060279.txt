Nils van der Poel of Sweden won the event, a few days after winning the 5000 m distance, and set a new world record. Patrick Roest of the Netherlands won the silver medal, and Davide Ghiotto of Italy the bronze, his first individual Olympic medal. The defending champion and the Olympic record holder was Ted-Jan Bloemen. The silver medalist, Jorrit Bergsma, qualified for the Olympics as well. The bronze medalist, Nicola Tumolero, did not start. Nils van der Poel was the 2021 World Single Distances champion at the 10,000 m distance, with Bergsma and Aleksandr Rumyantsev being the silver and bronze medalist, respectively. Van der Poel was also the world record holder at the start of the Olympics. He was leading the 2021â€“22 ISU Speed Skating World Cup at long distances with four races completed before the Olympics, followed by Bloemen and Davide Ghiotto. Van der Poel's skated season best, 12:38.92 in Stavanger on 20 November 2021. No skater has ever won the 10,000 m distance twice. Graeme Fish won the first pair, to be overtaken by Patrick Roest in pair 2. In pair 4, Bergsma skated the provisionally second time, with Roest still in the lead and two pairs to go. However, in pair 5 van der Poel set the world record, and Giotto, who until the last kilometer was faster than Roest, finally lost to Roest and became provisionally third. The last pair did not change the medal allocation.
