"She" is a song by the American rock band Green Day. It is the eighth track on their third album, Dookie and was released as Green Day's first promotional single in their discography. The song was written by frontman Billie Joe Armstrong about a former girlfriend who showed him a feminist poem with an identical title. In return, Armstrong wrote the lyrics of "She" and showed them to her. She later dumped him and moved to Ecuador, prompting Armstrong to put "She" on the album. The same ex-girlfriend is the topic of the songs "Sassafras Roots" and "Chump". It is one of the few Green Day singles that did not have a music video.
