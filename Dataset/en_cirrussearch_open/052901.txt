Yuri Vasilyevich Kondratyuk (Russian: Ю́рий Васи́льевич Кондратю́к; Ukrainian: Ю́рій Васи́льович Кондратю́к; 21 June 1897 – February 1942), real name Aleksandr Ignatyevich Shargei (Russian: Алекса́ндр Игна́тьевич Шарге́й; Ukrainian: Олександр Гнатович Шаргей) was a Ukrainian engineer and mathematician in the Soviet Union. He was a pioneer of astronautics and spaceflight, a theoretician and a visionary who, in the early 20th century, developed the first known lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR), a key concept for landing and return spaceflight from Earth to the Moon. The LOR was later used for the plotting of the first actual human spaceflight to the Moon. Many other aspects of spaceflight and space exploration are covered in his works. Kondratyuk made his scientific discoveries in circumstances of war (including both World Wars and the Russian Civil War), continuous persecutions from authorities and serious illnesses. In fact, "Yuri Kondratyuk", the name under which he became known both in Russia and abroad, was a stolen identity he assumed in 1921 for his own protection.
