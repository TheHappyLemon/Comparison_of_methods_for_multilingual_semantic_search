Tusk is a 2014 American independent body horror comedy psychological thriller film written and directed by Kevin Smith, based on a story from his SModcast podcast. The film stars Michael Parks, Justin Long, Haley Joel Osment, Genesis Rodriguez, Lily-Rose Depp and Johnny Depp. The film is the first in Smith's planned True North trilogy, followed by Yoga Hosers (2016). The film deals with an arrogant podcaster (Long) who travels to Canada for an interview, and in the process meets an eccentric retired sailor (Parks) with dark plans related to his obsession with a walrus named Mr. Tusk. Tusk had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, before it was released on September 19, 2014, by A24 and it received mixed reviews, with praise given to its atmosphere and production values but criticism for its inconsistent tone. The film was Smith's first major wide release since Cop Out (2010). However, some sources note that the divide amongst viewers and critics lends to a sort of cult status among some circles online.
