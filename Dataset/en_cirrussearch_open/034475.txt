Emma Jane Pooley (born 3 October 1982) is a British-Swiss athlete in multiple sports. A former professional cyclist who specialised in time trials and hilly races, she later transferred to endurance running, duathlon and triathlon, and was four-times world champion in long-distance duathlon. She competes in long-distance and uphill mountain running and has represented Switzerland at the world trailrunning championships. She won an Olympic silver medal in the time trial in 2008 and was world time trial champion in 2010. She has won six UCI Women's Road World Cup one-day races, as well as several stage races including the ten-day Tour de l'Aude. She is three-times a British time trial champion and in 2010 also won the British road race championships. Pooley retired from professional cycling after the 2014 Commonwealth Games to concentrate on triathlon, duathlon and long-distance running, having won the Lausanne Marathon and the Swissman triathlon the previous year. She went on to win the ITU Powerman Duathlon World Championships at Powerman Zofingen in September 2014 and again in 2015. On 16 December 2015, Pooley announced that she would be returning temporarily to cycling, seeking to qualify to represent Great Britain at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, as she felt the unusually mountainous time trial course on offer played to her strengths. In June 2016, Pooley came out of retirement and re-signed for her former team, Lottoâ€“Soudal Ladies, in time for the 2016 Giro Rosa. After racing in the Olympic time trial and road race she returned to duathlon with two further world championship titles at ITU Powerman Duathlon World Championships at Powerman Zofingen in September 2016 and 2017 as well as a European middle-distance duathlon title in 2017. Pooley was a founding member of Le Tour Entier, which campaigned for a Women's Tour de France and improvements to women's cycling generally.
