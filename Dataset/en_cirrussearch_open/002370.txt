These features were caused by the collision of large meteorites or comets with the Earth. For eroded or buried craters, the stated diameter typically refers to an estimate of original rim diameter, and may not correspond to present surface features. By EID convention, Russian and Asian craters are grouped together in the List of impact craters in Asia and Russia.
