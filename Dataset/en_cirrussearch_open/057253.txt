Jason Robertson (born July 22, 1999) is an American professional ice hockey left winger for the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Stars selected him in the second round, 39th overall, of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. Robertson was born in Arcadia, California, but his family moved to Northville, Michigan, at the age of 10 to increase his opportunities for ice hockey. He played for the Little Caesars and Detroit Kings minor ice hockey teams in Michigan before he was drafted by the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League in 2015. Robertson's 18 goals in his first season with Kingston were the most of any rookie since Anthony Stewart, and in the next two years, he became the first Frontenac to record back-to-back 40-goal seasons since Michael Zigomanis. Robertson was traded to the Niagara IceDogs partway through the 2018–19 OHL season, during which he recorded 117 points in 62 games to win both the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy and the CHL Top Scorer Award. Joining the Stars for the 2019–20 season, Robertson spent most of the year with the Texas Stars, Dallas's American Hockey League affiliate. He was included in Dallas's quarantine bubble for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs but did not appear in a game. Robertson made Dallas's opening night roster the following season, where he was the Calder Memorial Trophy runner-up with 17 goals and 28 assists in 51 games. Robertson continued his offensive production during the 2021–22 season, becoming the first player in Dallas Stars history to record hat-tricks in consecutive games. He was named an All-Star in 2022–23 en route to recording his first 100-point season.
