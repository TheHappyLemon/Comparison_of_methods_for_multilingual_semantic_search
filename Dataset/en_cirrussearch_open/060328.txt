In classical mechanics, impulse (symbolized by J or Imp) is the change in momentum of an object. If the initial momentum of an object is p1, and a subsequent momentum is p2, the object has received an impulse J: J=p2−p1.{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\mathbf {p} _{2}-\mathbf {p} _{1}.} Momentum is a vector quantity, so impulse is also a vector quantity. Newton’s second law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is equal to the resultant force F acting on the object: F=p2−p1Δt,{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {\mathbf {p} _{2}-\mathbf {p} _{1}}{\Delta t}},} so the impulse J delivered by a steady force F acting for time Δt is: J=FΔt.{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\mathbf {F} \Delta t.} The impulse delivered by a varying force is the integral of the force F with respect to time: J=∫Fdt.{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\int \mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} t.} The SI unit of impulse is the newton second (N⋅s), and the dimensionally equivalent unit of momentum is the kilogram metre per second (kg⋅m/s). The corresponding English engineering unit is the pound-second (lbf⋅s), and in the British Gravitational System, the unit is the slug-foot per second (slug⋅ft/s).
