Murad II (Ottoman Turkish: مراد ثانى, romanized: Murād-ı sānī, Turkish: II. Murad; 16 June 1404 – 3 February 1451) was twice the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1421 to 1444 and from 1446 to 1451. Murad II's reign saw a period of great economic development, with an increase in trade and a considerable expansion of Ottoman cities. In 1432, the traveller Bertrandon de la Broquière noted that Ottoman annual revenue had increased to 2,500,000 ducats, and that were Murad II to use all resources that were available to him he could have invaded Europe with ease.
