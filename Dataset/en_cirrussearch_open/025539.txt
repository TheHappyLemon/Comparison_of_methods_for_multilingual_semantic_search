Lidija Auza (February 24, 1914 â€“ December 13, 1989) was a Latvian painter, decorator and teacher. Among the first Latvian artists to apply different auxiliary materials, she is best known for her extraordinary assemblages and abstract paintings. Throughout her career, she became a remarkable figure in Latvian art releasing it from the official rules of socialist realism which encouraged other artists to remain true to their beliefs during the Soviet period.
