Margaric acid, or heptadecanoic acid, is a saturated fatty acid. Its molecular formula is CH3(CH2)15CO2H. Classified as an odd-chain fatty acid, it occurs as a trace component of the fat and milkfat of ruminants. Salts and esters of margaric acid are called heptadecanoates. Its name is derived from the Ancient Greek μάργαρος (márgar(on)), meaning "pearl(y)", due to its appearance.
