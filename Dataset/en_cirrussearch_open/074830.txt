The 2009 Riga riot was an outbreak of civil unrest in Riga, Latvia, on January 13, 2009, lasting for three hours following the economic downturn of the 2008 Latvian financial crisis as well as political discontent with the Latvian government's continued pursuance of austerity policies. Around 10,000 people gathered for anti-government protests which eventually became violent. The riot was the worst outbreak of violence in Latvia since 1991 when Latvia declared independence from the Soviet Union.
