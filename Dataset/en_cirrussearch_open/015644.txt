The "State Anthem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics" was the national anthem of the Soviet Union and the regional anthem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1944 to 1991, replacing "The Internationale". Its original lyrics were written by Sergey Mikhalkov (1913–2009) in collaboration with Gabriyel’ Arkadyevich Ureklyan (1899–1945), and its music was composed by Alexander Alexandrov (1883–1946). For a two-decade interval following de-Stalinization, the anthem was performed without lyrics. The second set of lyrics, also written by Mikhalkov and in which Stalin's name was omitted, was adopted in 1977. A decade after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the music was used for the Soviet Union's main successor state, the Russian Federation. It was adopted with new lyrics again written by Mikhalkov, while keeping the exact same melody, as the State Anthem of the Russian Federation.
