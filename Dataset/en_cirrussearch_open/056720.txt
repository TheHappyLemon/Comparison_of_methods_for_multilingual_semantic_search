Liberland, also known as the Free Republic of Liberland, is an unrecognised micronation in Southeast Europe claiming an uninhabited parcel of the western bank of the Danube, controlled by Croatia across from Serbia (locally known as Gornja Siga). It was proclaimed on 13 April 2015 by the Czech right-libertarian politician and activist Vít Jedlička, who is also its self-proclaimed “president”. Jedlička anticipated an eventual population of roughly 35,000 for the micronation, with cryptocurrency as its money. Its motto is “to live and let live”. The official website of Liberland states that the nation was created in the wake of the ongoing Croatia–Serbia border dispute. According to Jedlička, this dispute resulted in a plot of land west of the Danube being unclaimed by either side. The parcel of land in question is 7 km2 (2.7 sq mi) in area, roughly the same size as Gibraltar. It has been administered by Croatia since the Croatian War of Independence. Liberland has no diplomatic recognition from any recognized nation. The land lacks infrastructure and lies on the floodplain of the Danube. Croatia has frequently blocked off access to the Gornja Siga territory since 2015. As a result, a number of people, including Vít Jedlička, have been arrested for trying to enter the claimed land.
