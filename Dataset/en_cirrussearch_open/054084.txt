Amanita vaginata, commonly known as the grisette or the grisette amanita, is an edible mushroom in the fungus family Amanitaceae. The cap is gray or brownish, 5 to 10 centimetres (2 to 4 inches) in diameter, and has furrows around the edge that duplicate the gill pattern underneath. Unlike many other Amanita mushrooms, A.Â vaginata lacks a ring on the stem. A. vaginata has a widespread distribution in North America. It is not recommended for consumption due to the possibility of confusing it with poisonous species in the genus.
