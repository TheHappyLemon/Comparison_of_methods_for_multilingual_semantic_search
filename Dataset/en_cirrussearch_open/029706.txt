The Davis Strait is a southern arm of the Arctic Ocean that lies north of the Labrador Sea. It lies between mid-western Greenland and Baffin Island in Nunavut, Canada. To the north is Baffin Bay. The strait was named for the English explorer John Davis (1550â€“1605), who explored the area while seeking a Northwest Passage. By the 1650s it was used for whale hunting.
