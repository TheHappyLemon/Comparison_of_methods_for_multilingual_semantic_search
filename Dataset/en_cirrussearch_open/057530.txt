The reserve is in the center of Ukraine, along the northeast edge of the Dnieper Upland. It was created to protect valuable forest-steppe and floodplain habitat. The site is known for an abundance of archaeological sites left by cultures back to the Paleolithic. The reserve is a unit of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, and is located in Cherkasy Oblast.
