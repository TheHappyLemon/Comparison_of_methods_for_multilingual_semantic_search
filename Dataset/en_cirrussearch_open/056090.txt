Smith Sound (Danish: Smith Sund; French: DÃ©troit de Smith) is an Arctic sea passage between Greenland and Nunavut's northernmost island, Ellesmere Island. It links Baffin Bay with Kane Basin and forms part of the Nares Strait. On the Canadian side it extends from Cape Sabine in the north to Cape Isabella in the south. On the Greenland side of the sound were the now abandoned settlements of Etah and Annoatok.
