Sivert Guttorm Bakken (born 18 July 1998) is a Norwegian biathlete. He won the overall mass start title at the 2021–22 Biathlon World Cup. He also won his first world cup race the same year, in the 15 kilometer mass start in Oslo Holmenkollen, on 20 March 2022. After a successful 2021–2022 season, Bakken was unable to return to competition the following season due to a heart problem, pericarditis, that the Norwegian national team doctor determined was likely due to the coronavirus vaccine. He announced his intent to hopefully return during the 2023–2024 season, having resumed training, but has yet to have competed. Bakken is in a relationship with fellow biathlete Juni Arnekleiv.
