Virginio "Viri" Rosetta (Italian pronunciation: [virˈdʒiːnjo roˈzetta]; 25 February 1902 – 31 March 1975) was an Italian footballer who played as a defender. A hard-working player, he was known for his organisational skills, and for his ability to read the game and anticipate other players; he was also known to be a very precise passer of the ball, and an elegant full-back with good technique and a powerful shot, who was capable of starting plays from the back-line.
