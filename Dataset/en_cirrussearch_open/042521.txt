Dzyarzhynskaya Hara (Belarusian: Дзяржынская гара, romanized: Dziaržynskaja hara, [dzʲarˈʐɨnskaja]) is the highest point in Belarus. The hill is 345 meters (1,130 ft) above sea level and is located west of the capital Minsk, near Dzyarzhynsk, in the village of Skirmantava. The original name of the hill was Svyataya hara (Belarusian: Святая гара, lit. 'holy mountain'). In 1958, the hill was renamed Dzyarzhynskaya hara, in honour of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the NKVD.
