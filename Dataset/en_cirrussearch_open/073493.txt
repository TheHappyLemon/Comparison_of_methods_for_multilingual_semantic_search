The Women's 70 kg (also known as middleweight) tournament in the judo at the 2008 Summer Olympics was held on August 13 at the Beijing Science and Technology University Gymnasium. A total of 22 women competed in this event, limited to jūdōka with a bodyweight of less than 70 kilograms. Preliminary rounds started at 12:00 Noon CST. Repechage finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals, and the final were held at 18:00 pm CST. This event was the third-heaviest of the women's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 70 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts. Bronze medal winner Ronda Rousey, would later began a successful career in mixed martial arts where she would be the UFC's first female champion at bantamweight. She was later inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame.
