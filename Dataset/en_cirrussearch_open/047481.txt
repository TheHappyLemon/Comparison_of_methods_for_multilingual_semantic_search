Kyoko Hamaguchi (浜口 京子, Hamaguchi Kyōko, born January 11, 1978 in Taito, Tokyo) is a Japanese freestyle wrestler. She has won five FILA Wrestling World Championships and two Olympic Bronze medals in the 72 kg weight class. She is sponsored by Japan Beverage Inc. and was nominated by the Japanese Olympic Committee's Special Athlete Campaign. Her father is professional wrestler Animal Hamaguchi, who is known for his emotional displays during Kyoko's matches. Although Kyoko has long wanted to follow in her father's footsteps and enter the professional game, the lack of a stable women's circuit since the collapse of All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling has kept her from doing so.[citation needed]
