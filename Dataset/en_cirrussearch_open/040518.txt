Xanthi Football Club (Greek: Α.Ο. Ξάνθη) was a Greek professional football club based in Xanthi, Western Thrace and used to play at Xanthi FC Arena. Founded in 1967, Xanthi is well set up in terms of their financial support and youth setup. Xanthi participated in the UEFA Cup / Europa League in 2001–02, 2005–06, 2006–07 and 2013–14 seasons. In the 2004–05 season, Xanthi finished fourth in the Alpha Ethinki (first division, today Super League), the club's all-time best performance. Xanthi's first appearance in the first division was in 1989, and the club remained in the top flight until its relegation in 2020. On September 19, 2022, Xanthi FC announced its withdrawal from the Super League 2 championship, putting an end to its presence in the professional categories, as it failed to address the financial and administrative problems it was facing. Since then, the team has been undergoing dissolution, with only the amateur club AOX continuing to exist. Starting from the 2023-24 season, it will restart from the amateur leagues of the Thrace Football Association.
