In team sport, a player of the match award (also known as man of the match or woman of the match) is often given to the most outstanding player in a particular match. This can be a player from either team, although the player is generally chosen from the winning team. Some sports have unique traditions regarding these awards, and they are especially sought in championship or all-star games. In Australia, the term "best and fairest" is normally used, both for individual games and season-long awards. In some competitions, particularly in North America, the terms "most valuable player" (MVP) or "most outstanding player" are used. In ice hockey in North America, three players of the game, called the "three stars", are recognised. In sports where playoffs are decided by series rather than individual games, such as professional basketball and baseball, MVP awards are commonly given for the series, and in ice hockey's NHL, for performance in the entire playoffs.
