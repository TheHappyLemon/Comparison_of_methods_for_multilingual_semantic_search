Beerenberg is a stratovolcano dominating the northeastern end of the Norwegian island of Jan Mayen. It is 2,277 m (7,470 ft) high and is the world's northernmost subaerial active volcano and the only active volcano in Norway. The volcano is topped by a mostly ice-filled crater about one kilometre (5⁄8 mile) wide, with numerous peaks along its rim including the highest summit, Haakon VII Toppen, on its western side.
