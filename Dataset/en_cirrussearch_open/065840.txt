The American occupation zone in Germany (German: Amerikanische Besatzungszone), also known as the US-Zone, and the Southwest zone, was one of the four occupation zones established by the Allies of World War II in Germany west of the Oderâ€“Neisse line in July 1945, around two months after the German surrender and the end of World War II in Europe. It was controlled by the Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS) and ceased to exist after the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany on 21 September 1949 (FRG established 23 May 1949), but United States maintains military presence across Germany.
