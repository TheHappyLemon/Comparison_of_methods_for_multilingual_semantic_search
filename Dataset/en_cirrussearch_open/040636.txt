In mathematics (specifically multivariable calculus), a multiple integral is a definite integral of a function of several real variables, for instance, f(x, y) or f(x, y, z). Physical (natural philosophy) interpretation: S any surface, V any volume, etc.. Incl. variable to time, position, etc. Integrals of a function of two variables over a region in R2{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} (the real-number plane) are called double integrals, and integrals of a function of three variables over a region in R3{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} (real-number 3D space) are called triple integrals. For multiple integrals of a single-variable function, see the Cauchy formula for repeated integration.
