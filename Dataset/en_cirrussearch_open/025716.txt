The Waray Wikipedia is the Waray language edition of Wikipedia. It is hosted on servers run by the Wikimedia Foundation since September 25, 2005. As of March 27, 2024, this edition has 1,266,425 articles and is the 16th largest Wikipedia edition. The Waray Wikipedia has very few active users (59), and instead owes its large size to automatically generated articles created by bots, most of them by Sverker Johansson's Lsjbot. Waray (or Waray-Waray) is spoken by approximately 3.6 million people in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines.
