Vecāķi (Latvian pronunciation: [ˈvætsaːci]) is a Northern District neighbourhood in Riga, the capital of Latvia. It is one of Riga's neighborhoods lying on the shores of Gulf of Riga, Baltic Sea. Westward Vecāķi is bordered by Vecdaugava – a partial oxbow lake (a dead-end fork of River Daugava that hasn't been cut off from it completely.) Thus Vecāķi offers both freshwater and brackish water bathing places, with the former having a higher water temperature come summer due to the smaller volume of Vecdaugava. German names for the town include Bad Magnushof, Wezaken, and Wetsanck Dorf.
