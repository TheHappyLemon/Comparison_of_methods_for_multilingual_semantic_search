Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics was the nineteenth appearance of the sport of basketball as an official Olympic medal event. It took place at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and was held from 6 August to 21 August 2016. The preliminary and knockout round matches for men were played inside the Carioca Arena 1 in Olympic Park which seated up to 16,000 spectators. The matches for women were played at the Youth Arena. This marked the first time that the men's and women's Olympic tournaments were played in multiple/separate venues. The host country Brazil failed to make it to the quarterfinals of both the men's and women's tournaments, after being eliminated from the group stage. Three countries in both categories took all of the medals: the United States (who took both gold medals), Serbia and Spain.
