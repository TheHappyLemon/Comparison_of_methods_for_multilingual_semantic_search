.dm is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Commonwealth of Dominica in the eastern Caribbean. Registrants of a second-level .dm domain get the corresponding third-level names within .com.dm, .net.dm and .org.dm automatically included. There are no restrictions on who can register these names, but they are not very heavily used. One example of a ".dm" web property is a URL shortener, play.dm, used exclusively by Playdom, which is an example of domain hacking.
