In culinary terminology, squab is an immature domestic pigeon, typically under four weeks old, or its meat. Some authors describe it as tasting like dark chicken. The word "squab" probably comes from Scandinavia; the Swedish word skvabb means "loose, fat flesh". The term formerly applied to all dove and pigeon species (such as the wood pigeon, the mourning dove, the extinct-in-the-wild socorro dove, and the now extinct passenger pigeon,) and their meat. More recently, squab meat comes almost entirely from domesticated pigeons. The meat of dove and pigeon gamebirds hunted primarily for sport is rarely called "squab". The practice of domesticating pigeons as livestock may have originated in North Africa; historically, many societies have consumed squabs or pigeons, including ancient Egypt (still common in modern Egypt), Rome, China, India (Northeast), and medieval Europe. Although squab has been consumed throughout much of recorded history, it is generally regarded[citation needed] as exotic, not as a contemporary staple food; there are more records of its preparation for the wealthy than for the poor. The modern squab industry uses utility pigeons. Squab farmers raise the young until they are roughly a month old (when they reach adult size but have not yet flown) before slaughter.
