Truskavets (Ukrainian: Трускавець; Polish: Truskawiec) is a city in Drohobych Raion, western Ukraine's Lviv Oblast (region), near the border with Poland. It hosts the administration of Truskavets urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. The population is approximately 28,287 (2022 estimate). Truskavets is famous for its mineral springs, which have made it one of Ukraine's great resorts. For most visitors the primary goal is consuming the various 'local waters.' The most famous is the naphtha and sulfur-scented, slightly saline 'Naftusia.' The town lies in an attractive little valley in the Carpathian foothills and is easily reached from Lviv by bus or train. The vast majority of tourists who come to Truskavets are Ukrainian or Belarusian. The modern coat of arms of the city depicts a goose with raised wings and a branch in its beak. According to history, it symbolizes vigilance, kindness and health. In 2000, a special economic zone (SEZ) was established in Truskavets for the period of 20 years. Known as "Kurortopolis Truskavets", the SEZ offered various tax privileges for businesses and investors. Some 13 investment projects were approved under its framework, with the majority focusing on health and medical treatment.
