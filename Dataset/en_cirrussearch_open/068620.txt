The Brassicales (or Cruciales) are an order of flowering plants, belonging to the eurosids II group of dicotyledons under the APG II system. One character common to many members of the order is the production of glucosinolate (mustard oil) compounds. Most systems of classification have included this order, although sometimes under the name Capparales (the name chosen depending on which is thought to have priority). The order typically contains the following families: Akaniaceae – two species of turnipwood trees, native to Asia and eastern Australia Bataceae – salt-tolerant shrubs from America and Australasia Brassicaceae – mustard and cabbage family; may include the Cleomaceae Capparaceae – caper family, sometimes included in Brassicaceae Caricaceae – papaya family Cleomaceae Gyrostemonaceae – several genera of small shrubs and trees endemic to temperate parts of Australia Koeberliniaceae – one species of thorn bush native to Mexico and the US Southwest Limnanthaceae – meadowfoam family Moringaceae – thirteen species of trees from Africa and India Pentadiplandraceae – African species whose berries have two highly sweet tasting proteins Resedaceae – mignonette family Salvadoraceae – three genera found from Africa to Java Setchellanthaceae Tiganophytaceae Tovariaceae Tropaeolaceae – nasturtium family
