Sinope /səˈnoʊpiː/ is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Lick Observatory in 1914, and is named after Sinope of Greek mythology. Sinope did not receive its present name until 1975; before then, it was simply known as Jupiter IX. It was sometimes called "Hades" between 1955 and 1975.
