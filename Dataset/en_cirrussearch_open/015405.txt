Lake Athabasca (/ˌæθəˈbæskə/; French: lac Athabasca; from Woods Cree: ᐊᖬᐸᐢᑳᐤ aðapaskāw, "[where] there are plants one after another") is in the north-west corner of Saskatchewan and the north-east corner of Alberta between 58° and 60° N in Canada. The lake is 26% in Alberta and 74% in Saskatchewan. The lake is fed by the Athabasca River and other rivers, and its water flows northward via the Slave River to the Mackenzie River system, eventually reaching the Arctic Ocean.
