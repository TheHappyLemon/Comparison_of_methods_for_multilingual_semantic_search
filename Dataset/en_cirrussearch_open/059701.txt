Nutepelmen (Russian: Нутэпэльмен; Chukchi: Нутэпылмын, Nutèpylmyn), is a village (selo) on the northern shores of Iultinsky District, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, in the Far Eastern Federal District of Russia. The village is a traditional Chukchi and Yupik settlement in an area that has been inhabited for centuries. Whilst the village still exists, in 2010, a law was passed abolishing the municipal rural settlement of Nutepelmen, meaning that administration responsibilities passed to the central district administration.
