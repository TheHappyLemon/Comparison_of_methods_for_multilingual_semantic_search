Pontus Sven Gustav Jansson (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈpɔ̌nːtɵs ˈjɑ̌ːnsɔn]; born 13 February 1991) is a Swedish professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Malmö FF. Jansson started his career with local club Malmö FF before moving to Italy to join Torino. He failed to impress at the Turin-based club and was sent out on loan to Leeds United, before making the move permanent. After three years in Leeds, he signed for fellow Championship side Brentford in 2019, becoming captain shortly after. A full international between 2012 and 2021, Jansson won 27 caps for the Sweden national team and represented his country at UEFA Euro 2016, the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2020.
