"Benzin" (German, in English: Gasoline or Petrol) is a song by German industrial metal band Rammstein, released as the first single from their album Rosenrot. In Germany, gasoline is called Benzin (which is derived from the chemical mixture benzine). The song uses the word "Gasolin", however the word does not exist in the German language, but it is an English word made German. There was, however, a German chain of gas stations called "Gasolin." Benzin was Rammstein's first number one single, getting to number one in Finland after its release in 2005.
