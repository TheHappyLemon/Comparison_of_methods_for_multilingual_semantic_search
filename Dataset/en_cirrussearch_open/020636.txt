Zdeněk Štybar (Czech pronunciation: [ˈzdɛɲɛk ˈʃtɪbar]; born 11 December 1985) is a Czech former professional cyclist, who rode professionally in cyclo-cross and road bicycle racing between 2005 and 2024 for Telenet–Fidea, the Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl Team and Team Jayco–AlUla. In the early part of his career, Štybar prioritised competing in cyclo-cross, where he won three world titles – in 2010, 2011 and 2014 – as well as six consecutive national titles and overall victories in both the 2009–10 UCI Cyclo-cross World Cup and the 2009–10 Cyclo-cross Superprestige.
