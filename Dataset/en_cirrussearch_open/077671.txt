In mathematics, the complex conjugate of a complex number is the number with an equal real part and an imaginary part equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. That is, if a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are real numbers then the complex conjugate of a+bi{\displaystyle a+bi} is a−bi.{\displaystyle a-bi.} The complex conjugate of z{\displaystyle z} is often denoted as z¯{\displaystyle {\overline {z}}} or z∗{\displaystyle z^{*}}. In polar form, if r{\displaystyle r} and φ{\displaystyle \varphi } are real numbers then the conjugate of reiφ{\displaystyle re^{i\varphi }} is re−iφ.{\displaystyle re^{-i\varphi }.} This can be shown using Euler's formula. The product of a complex number and its conjugate is a real number: a2+b2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}} (or r2{\displaystyle r^{2}} in polar coordinates). If a root of a univariate polynomial with real coefficients is complex, then its complex conjugate is also a root.
