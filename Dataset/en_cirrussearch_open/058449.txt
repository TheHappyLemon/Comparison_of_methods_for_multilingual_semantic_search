Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf), the highest sports award in Germany, was endowed on 23 June 1950 by the German President Theodor Heuss. It is awarded to athletes and teams of exemplary character that have won medals at Olympic and Paralympic Games, won important international titles like the football World Cup, or placed several times at international championships. To be honored with Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, an athlete or a team has to be nominated by the president of the German Olympic Sports Confederation to the German President. The request will be reviewed by the Office of the German President and the Federal Ministry of the Interior as this agency is responsible for sport in Germany. The President and the Minister of the Interior both sign the application, following article 58 of the Grundgesetz.
