The Super Liga is an association football league that is currently the top division of Moldovan football league system. The competition was established in 1992, when the country became independent from the Soviet Union. It was formed in place of former Soviet republican competitions that existed since 1945. Before the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940, clubs from modern Moldova competed in the Romanian football competitions, particularly Nistru Chișinău. There are currently eight teams in the competition. At the end of the season, the bottom club is relegated to Liga 1 and replaced by the lower league's champion. Sheriff Tiraspol—located in Transnistria—is the most successful league club with 21 titles, and is followed by Zimbru Chișinău with eight wins. Dacia Chișinău, FC Tiraspol and Milsami Orhei also conquered the title on one occasion.
