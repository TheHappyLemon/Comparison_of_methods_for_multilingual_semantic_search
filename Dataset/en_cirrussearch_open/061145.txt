Nicolae "Nicușor" Claudiu Stanciu (Romanian pronunciation: [nikoˈla.e klaˈudju ˈstant͡ʃju]; born 7 May 1993) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or a winger for Saudi Pro League club Damac and captains the Romania national team. Stanciu began his career at Unirea Alba Iulia in 2008, and went on to represent Vaslui and Steaua București in his country, winning six domestic honours and making a name for himself with the latter. He moved abroad for the first time in 2016, his eventual €9.8 transfer to Anderlecht making him the then-most expensive signing of the Belgian First Division A, and later the then-biggest sale of the Liga I, after bonuses. After winning a Belgian national title and a Super Cup, Stanciu joined Sparta Prague one and a half years later for another internal record fee, worth around an initial €4.5 million. He left the Czech Republic at the start of 2019 to sign for Saudi team Al-Ahli, only to return in that summer to the country at former rival club Slavia Prague, where he helped to back-to-back league titles and a Czech Cup in his first two seasons. Since 2022, he has competed professionally in China and again Saudi Arabia. Stanciu made his senior international debut for Romania in March 2016, in a 1–0 win over Lithuania, after having previously played for it at under-19 and under-21 levels. He represented the nation in the UEFA Euro 2016.
