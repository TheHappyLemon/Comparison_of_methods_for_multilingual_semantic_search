Benjamin Mendy (born 17 July 1994) is a French professional footballer who plays as a left-back for Ligue 1 club Lorient. After coming through Le Havre's youth academy, Mendy began his playing career with the club's reserve team in 2010, being promoted to the first team a year later. He remained with the club until 2013, when he joined Ligue 1 club Marseille. Mendy spent the next three seasons with Les Olympiens before leaving for Monaco, with whom he won the national championship in 2016–17. In 2017, Mendy moved to English club Manchester City for a reported £52 million, then the world-record transfer fee for a defender. He won the Premier League in his first season in England. In 2021, Mendy was arrested on allegations of sexual offences and suspended by City. He was acquitted of all charges against him in two trials in 2023. Released by Manchester City in June 2023 at the end of his contract, he joined Lorient. Mendy made his senior debut for France in 2017 after previously being capped by France youth teams at under-16, under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels. He was chosen in France's squad for the 2018 World Cup, which they won.
