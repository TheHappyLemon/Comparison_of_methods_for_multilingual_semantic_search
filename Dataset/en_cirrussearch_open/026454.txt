The Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Russian: Федеральная служба по надзору в сфере защиты прав потребителей и благополучия человека; also Rospotrebnadzor; Russian: Роспотребнадзор) is the federal service responsible for the supervision of consumer rights protection and human wellbeing in Russia. This service was founded in 2004, and was included in the structure of the Ministry of Health Care of Russia until 2012. In May 2012 Rospotrebnadzor was removed from the supervision of the Ministry of Health and now reports directly to the Russian Government. It functions on the authority of the Act of Federal Service on the base of the Administrative Regulation.
