.tg is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Togo. Although there are no restrictions on who can register domains in this TLD, it is not often used outside Togo. As of 2008[update], no online registration and domain maintenance features were available on the registry site, although a basic web-based whois capability is provided.
