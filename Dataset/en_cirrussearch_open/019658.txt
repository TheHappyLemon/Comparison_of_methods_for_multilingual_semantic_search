In mathematics, the binomial coefficients are the positive integers that occur as coefficients in the binomial theorem. Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers n ≥ k ≥ 0 and is written (nk).{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}.} It is the coefficient of the xk term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power (1 + x)n; this coefficient can be computed by the multiplicative formula (nk)=n×(n−1)×⋯×(n−k+1)k×(k−1)×⋯×1,{\displaystyle {\binom {n}{k}}={\frac {n\times (n-1)\times \cdots \times (n-k+1)}{k\times (k-1)\times \cdots \times 1}},} which using factorial notation can be compactly expressed as (nk)=n!k!(n−k)!.{\displaystyle {\binom {n}{k}}={\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}.} For example, the fourth power of 1 + x is (1+x)4=(40)x0+(41)x1+(42)x2+(43)x3+(44)x4=1+4x+6x2+4x3+x4,{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(1+x)^{4}&={\tbinom {4}{0}}x^{0}+{\tbinom {4}{1}}x^{1}+{\tbinom {4}{2}}x^{2}+{\tbinom {4}{3}}x^{3}+{\tbinom {4}{4}}x^{4}\\&=1+4x+6x^{2}+4x^{3}+x^{4},\end{aligned}}} and the binomial coefficient (42)=4×32×1=4!2!2!=6{\displaystyle {\tbinom {4}{2}}={\tfrac {4\times 3}{2\times 1}}={\tfrac {4!}{2!2!}}=6} is the coefficient of the x2 term. Arranging the numbers (n0),(n1),…,(nn){\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{0}},{\tbinom {n}{1}},\ldots ,{\tbinom {n}{n}}} in successive rows for n = 0, 1, 2, ... gives a triangular array called Pascal's triangle, satisfying the recurrence relation (nk)=(n−1k−1)+(n−1k).{\displaystyle {\binom {n}{k}}={\binom {n-1}{k-1}}+{\binom {n-1}{k}}.} The binomial coefficients occur in many areas of mathematics, and especially in combinatorics. The symbol (nk){\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}} is usually read as "n choose k" because there are (nk){\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}} ways to choose an (unordered) subset of k elements from a fixed set of n elements. For example, there are (42)=6{\displaystyle {\tbinom {4}{2}}=6} ways to choose 2 elements from {1, 2, 3, 4}, namely {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4} and {3, 4}. The binomial coefficients can be generalized to (zk){\displaystyle {\tbinom {z}{k}}} for any complex number z and integer k ≥ 0, and many of their properties continue to hold in this more general form.
