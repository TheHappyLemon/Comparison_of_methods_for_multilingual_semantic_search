Fernando Codá dos Santos Cavalcanti Marques (born 8 October 1979) is a Brazilian mathematician working mainly in geometry, topology, partial differential equations and Morse theory. He is a professor at Princeton University. In 2012, together with André Neves, he proved the Willmore conjecture. Since then, among proving other important conjectures, Marques and Neves greatly extended Almgren–Pitts min-max theory to prove theorems about minimal surfaces.
