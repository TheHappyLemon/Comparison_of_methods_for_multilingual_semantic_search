Monsters at Work is an American animated television series developed by Bobs Gannaway that premiered on Disney+ on July 7, 2021, as part of Pixar's Monsters, Inc. franchise. Based on, and a direct continuation of Monsters, Inc., it features the voices of Billy Crystal and John Goodman reprising their roles as Mike Wazowski and James P. "Sulley" Sullivan from the original film and the 2013 prequel Monsters University; several other voice actors from the films reprise their roles as guests. Unlike other animated productions in the Monsters, Inc. franchise, Pixar did not produce the series, being instead produced by Disney Television Animation, the studio's second series to be based on a Pixar film after Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, on which Pixar served as a co-producer studio. A second season was announced and will premiere on April 5, 2024, on Disney Channel and May 5, 2024, on Disney+. The series received generally positive reviews from critics.
