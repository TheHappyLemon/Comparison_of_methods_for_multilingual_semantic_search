Little Secrets is a 2001 American comedy-drama family film directed by Blair Treu. It was produced by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment and stars Evan Rachel Wood, Michael Angarano, and David Gallagher. The film follows Emily (played by Wood), a 14-year-old aspiring violinist who runs a secret-keeping booth in her neighborhood, offering the other children advice when they confess their secrets to her. Complicating Emily's life are her soon-to-be-born sibling and the two teenage brothers (Angarano and Gallagher) who move in next door. Emily soon finds herself unraveling under the weight of all the secrets, including one of her own. The film is the second collaboration between Treu and writer Jessica Barondes, having previously teamed up for Disney Channel's Wish Upon a Star (1996). A proponent of family-oriented media, Treu wanted to make a grounded and character-driven film with a positive message, something he felt contemporary Hollywood was lacking. To prepare for what she considered her first family-friendly role, Wood spent two months learning how to mimic playing the violin. Little Secrets was shot on location in Salt Lake City in the summer of 2001, with local child actors rounding out the supporting roles. Utah-based composer Sam Cardon provided the score. Little Secrets premiered at the Heartland Film Festival on October 21, 2001, under its original title Secret Keeper. It was also screened at the Salt Lake Children's Film Festival, before being released theatrically by the independent film company Samuel Goldwyn Films on August 23, 2002. Wood's performance was widely praised, but while some critics found the film wholesome and sweet, others derided it as superficial and bland. Commercially, the film grossed $750,582 at the box office.
