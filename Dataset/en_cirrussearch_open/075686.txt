In geometry a quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon, having four edges (sides) and four corners (vertices). The word is derived from the Latin words quadri, a variant of four, and latus, meaning "side". It is also called a tetragon, derived from Greek "tetra" meaning "four" and "gon" meaning "corner" or "angle", in analogy to other polygons (e.g. pentagon). Since "gon" means "angle", it is analogously called a quadrangle, or 4-angle. A quadrilateral with vertices A{\displaystyle A}, B{\displaystyle B}, C{\displaystyle C} and D{\displaystyle D} is sometimes denoted as ◻ABCD{\displaystyle \square ABCD}. Quadrilaterals are either simple (not self-intersecting), or complex (self-intersecting, or crossed). Simple quadrilaterals are either convex or concave. The interior angles of a simple (and planar) quadrilateral ABCD add up to 360 degrees of arc, that is ∠A+∠B+∠C+∠D=360∘.{\displaystyle \angle A+\angle B+\angle C+\angle D=360^{\circ }.} This is a special case of the n-gon interior angle sum formula: S = (n − 2) × 180°. All non-self-crossing quadrilaterals tile the plane, by repeated rotation around the midpoints of their edges.
