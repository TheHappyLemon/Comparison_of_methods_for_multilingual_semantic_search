Turkey has no official national emblem, but the crescent and star (Turkish: ay-yıldız, lit. 'crescent-star') design from the national flag is in use on Turkish passports, Turkish identity cards and at the diplomatic missions of Turkey. The crescent and star are from the 19th-century Ottoman flag (1844–1923) which also forms the basis of the present-day Turkish flag. Following the abolition of the Sultanate on 1 November 1922, the Ottoman coat of arms was no longer used and the crescent and star became Turkey's de facto national emblem. In the national identity cards of the 1930s the horns of the crescent were facing left, instead of the now more common orientation towards right.
