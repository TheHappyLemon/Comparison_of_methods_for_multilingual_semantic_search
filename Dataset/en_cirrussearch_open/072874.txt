Club Atlético de Madrid, S.A.D. (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkluβ aˈtletiko ðe maˈðɾið]; meaning "Athletic Club of Madrid"), known simply as Atleti in Spanish-speaking countries and commonly referred to at the international level as Atlético Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid that plays in La Liga. The club play their home games at the Metropolitano, which has a capacity of 70,460. Founded on 26 April 1903 as Athletic Club Sucursal de Madrid, the club has traditionally worn red and white vertical striped shirts, being known as Los Colchoneros ("The Mattress Makers") and Los Rojiblancos. The club became Atlético de Madrid in 1946 and began a long-standing rivalry with Madrid neighbours Real Madrid, with whom they contest the El Derbi Madrileño. They also share a rivalry with Barcelona. Felipe VI, the King of Spain, has been the honorary president of the club since 2003. In terms of league titles won, Atlético Madrid are the third most successful club in Spanish football—behind Real Madrid and Barcelona. Atlético have won La Liga on eleven occasions, including a league and cup double in 1996; the Copa del Rey on ten occasions; two Supercopas de España, one Copa Presidente FEF [es] and one Copa Eva Duarte; in Europe, they won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1962, were runners-up in 1963 and 1986, were UEFA Champions League runners-up in 1974, 2014 and 2016, won the UEFA Europa League in 2010, 2012 and 2018, and won the UEFA Super Cup in 2010, 2012 and 2018 as well as the 1974 Intercontinental Cup. After suffering a decline in fortunes during the 2000s, the club have enjoyed a revival since 2011, under the management of Diego Simeone, with him forging a distinctive identity marked by defensive style and a strong sense of team unity and spirit, instilling a collective responsibility that transcends individual performances. This enables them to compete with rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona for major honours, winning La Liga twice, one Copa del Rey, two UEFA Europa League, as well as been runners-up of the UEFA Champions League twice losing to Real Madrid.
