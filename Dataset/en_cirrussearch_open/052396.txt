In December 2018, it transpired that adult men, all of whom had arrived in Finland as asylum seekers or refugees, were grooming, and raping and otherwise sexually abusing, girls under 15 years of age in Oulu, Finland. One victim ended up committing suicide. The Oulu Police Department warned young girls and parents, while emphasizing that "not all people with foreign backgrounds are dishonest or criminals". By mid-January 2019, the suspects numbered 16. The case was said to have "rocked" Finland, where cabinet members broke the otherwise normal Finnish taboo about commenting about ongoing criminal investigations.
