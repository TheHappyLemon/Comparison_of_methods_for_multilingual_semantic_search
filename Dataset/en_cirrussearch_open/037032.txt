Pierre-Emerick Emiliano François Aubameyang ONM (born 18 June 1989) is a professional footballer who plays as a striker for Ligue 1 club Marseille and captains the Gabon national team. The son of Pierre Aubameyang, Pierre-Emerick began his senior club career playing for Italian club AC Milan, but never appeared for the club as he went on a series of loan spells in France. He moved to Saint-Étienne in 2011. There, he won a Coupe de la Ligue title and joined Borussia Dortmund in 2013. In Germany, Aubameyang finished as the league's top goalscorer in the 2016–17 season and won a DFB-Pokal. He also ranks as the club's seventh highest all-time goalscorer. In 2018, Aubameyang was the subject of a then-club record association football transfer when he signed for Arsenal in a transfer worth £56 million (€60 million), making him the most expensive Gabonese player of all time. With Arsenal, he won an FA Cup and finished as the league's joint-top goalscorer in the 2018–19 season. After departing Arsenal in 2022, Aubameyang had spells with Barcelona and Chelsea before signing for Marseille in 2023. Born in France, Aubameyang chose to represent Gabon at international level, eventually becoming the nation's all-time top goalscorer. He made his senior debut for Gabon in 2009 aged 19, and appeared in four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments and the 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2016, Aubameyang was named African Footballer of the Year; the first Gabonese and second European-born player to win the award.
