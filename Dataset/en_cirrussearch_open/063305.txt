The Association of German Public Banks (German: Bundesverband Öffentlicher Banken Deutschlands, generally referred to as VÖB) is a leading association within the German banking sector, bringing together most of the German public banking sector except the local-level savings banks (German: Sparkassen). Its membership includes 63 banks, including the Landesbanks that are also members of the Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband (DSGV) and form part of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, and promotional and development banks (German: Förderbanken) owned by the Federal Republic of Germany or the individual German federal states. VÖB is the only German banking association exercising the functions of an employer association for its member institutions: the Public-Sector Banks’ Employer Association (German: Tarifgemeinschaft Öffentlicher Banken), which comprises VÖB member institutions with a total of 60,000 employees (as at financial year 2022) and which performs collective bargaining duties. VÖB is also a member of the European Banking Federation (EBF) together with the Bundesverband deutscher Banken, Germany being the only country represented in the EBF by more than one member, and of the European Association of Public Banks [de].
