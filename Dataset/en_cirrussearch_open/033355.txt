Jan Piotr Sapieha (English: John Peter Sapieha, 1569–1611) was a Polish-Lithuanian nobleman, general, politician, diplomat, governor of Uświat county, member of the Parliament and a skilled commander of the Polish troops stationing in the Moscow Kremlin. Sapieha was a participant of the Polish-Swedish War – he brought a private regiment of 100 Cossacks, and commanded the right wing, consisting of 400 winged hussars and mounted 700 Cossack, of the Polish-Lithuanian army during the famous Battle of Kircholm in 1605. He also participated in the Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18), where he commanded the failed siege of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra in 1608 and later fought anti-Polish Muscovite forces near Moscow, led by Prokopy Lyapunov. He died suddenly on 15 October, during the siege of the Moscow Kremlin. Known for his ruthlessness towards the Russian peoples, he was nicknamed Pan Hetman, literally meaning Mr General.
