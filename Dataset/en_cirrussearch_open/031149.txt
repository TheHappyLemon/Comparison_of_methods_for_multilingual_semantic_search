The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history characterized by warfare, bureaucratic and military reform, and political consolidation. It followed the Spring and Autumn period and concluded with the wars of conquest that saw the state of Qin annex all the other contender states by 221 BC and found the Qin dynasty, the first imperial dynasty in Chinese history. Although different scholars assign different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the beginning of the Warring States period, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is the most often cited. The Warring States period largely comprises the second half of the Eastern Zhou period; during this time, the king of Zhou was formally the Chinese sovereign, but ruled merely as a figurehead. This dynamic served as the backdrop for the machinations of the warring states. The label "Warring States period" is derived from the Record of the Warring States, a history compiled during the early Han dynasty.
