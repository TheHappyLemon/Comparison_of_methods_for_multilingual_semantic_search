The 2014 Russian Grand Prix (formally known as the 2014 Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix; Russian: Гран-при России 2014 года, romanized: Gran-pri Rossii 2014 goda) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 October 2014. The fifty-three lap race was held at the Sochi Autodrom, a brand new circuit built on the site of the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city of Sochi in Krasnodar Krai, Russia. The race was the sixteenth round of the 2014 season, following on from the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka one week previously, and preceding the United States Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas. The race marked the first time that the Russian Grand Prix had been held in a century, and was also the first time the Russian Grand Prix was run as a round of the Formula One World Championship since the championship was formed in 1950. Lewis Hamilton in a Mercedes won the race after starting from pole position and leading every lap. His teammate Nico Rosberg finished second, after working his way up from the back of field after having to make an unscheduled pit stop on the first lap. Williams's Valtteri Bottas completed the podium, having set the fastest lap—and a new lap record—on the final lap of the race. Following Jules Bianchi's serious accident in the Japanese Grand Prix, Marussia entered a single car for Max Chilton, leaving the grid with twenty-one cars. The race ultimately proved to be Marussia's last of the season, as the team went into administration ahead of the next race in the United States. The result secured the World Constructors' Championship for Mercedes with three races remaining in the season, while Hamilton extended his World Drivers' Championship lead over Rosberg to seventeen points. Bottas's podium allowed him to overtake Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel in the drivers' standings.
