The 2009 NHL Entry Draft was the 47th Entry Draft. It was held on June 26–27, 2009, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec. The Draft was part of the Montreal Canadiens' centennial celebrations. National Hockey League teams took turns selecting amateur ice hockey players from junior, collegiate, or European leagues. The New York Islanders, who finished last overall in the 2008–09 NHL season, retained the first overall selection following that year's NHL Draft lottery. The New York Islanders used the first overall pick to select center John Tavares from the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). The Tampa Bay Lightning used the second pick to draft defenceman Victor Hedman from Modo Hockey of the SEL, and the Colorado Avalanche drafted Matt Duchene of the Brampton Battalion with the third overall pick. Seven Swedes were selected in the first round, an all-time record for the country.
