Little Fockers (known as Meet the Parents: Little Fockers in the United Kingdom and Southeast Asia) is a 2010 American romantic comedy film, and the third and final film in the Meet the Parents film series, serving as a sequel to Meet the Parents (2000) and Meet the Fockers (2004). The film stars Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo, Jessica Alba, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. After the commercial success of the first two films in the franchise, both De Niro and Stiller received a remuneration of $20 million for their roles in Little Fockers. In addition to the original cast, Little Fockers features Jessica Alba, Laura Dern, Kevin Hart and Harvey Keitel. Although the film was a box-office success, grossing over $310Â million worldwide, it earned less than its predecessors, and was panned by critics.
