He won the Memorial Cup with the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s London Knights and a gold medal with Canada at the World Junior Championships during his major junior career.

During his two one-year campaigns with the Dallas Stars and Montreal Canadiens respectively, Perry lost consecutive Stanley Cup Finals to the Tampa Bay Lightning; Perry proceed to join the Lightning the very next season after his time with the Canadiens, where he proceeded to lose a third straight Stanley Cup Finals, and in doing so became the first player in NHL history to lose three consecutive Stanley Cup Finals with three different teams.
