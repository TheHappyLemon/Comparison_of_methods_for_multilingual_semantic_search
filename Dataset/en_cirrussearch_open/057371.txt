The Georgian men's national ice hockey team (Georgian: საქართველოს ეროვნული ყინულის ჰოკეის ნაკრები) is the national men's ice hockey team of Georgia, and has been a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) since 8 May 2009. As of 2022, Georgia is ranked 43rd in the World Ranking. Georgia first played in the World Championships tournament in 2013, and remained at Division III level until winning at that level in 2018 and earning a promotion to Division II Group B, where they currently play. Though ice hockey was first introduced to Georgia in the 1960s, the sport was never very popular and there were long stretches when it was not played at all. In 2004 the Georgian Ice Hockey Federation was established, and a domestic league began in 2007, allowing for the development of the national team and its entry into international competition in 2010, playing their first competitive matches in 2012.
