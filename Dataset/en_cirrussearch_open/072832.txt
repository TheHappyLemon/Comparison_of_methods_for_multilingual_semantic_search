The Gaising or Gaiziņkalns (German: Mesenberg), at 312 m (1,024 feet) above sea level, is the highest point in Latvia. It is situated in the Vidzeme Upland a short distance to the west of the town of Madona, central Vidzeme. Although only relatively high, Gaiziņkalns has been developed into a skiing area with three slopes and several guesthouses. In order to rival Suur Munamägi - the highest point of neighbouring Estonia at 318 metres - a tower was built which exceeds the latter in height. Although the construction work was not finished, the tower became a popular tourist attraction, which led to its closure due to the serious risk to safety. The tower was demolished in December 2012, and the rubble removed. There is a nearby multilingual sign marking the high point, but nothing at the natural summit itself.
