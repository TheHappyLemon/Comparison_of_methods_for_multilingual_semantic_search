In physics, specifically in electromagnetism, the Lorentz force (or electromagnetic force) is the combination of electric and magnetic force on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields. A particle of charge q moving with a velocity v in an electric field E and a magnetic field B experiences a force (in SI units) of F=q(E+vÃ—B).{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q\left(\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} \right).} It says that the electromagnetic force on a charge q is a combination of (1) a force in the direction of the electric field E (proportional to the magnitude of the field and the quantity of charge), and (2) a force at right angles to both the magnetic field B and the velocity v of the charge (proportional to the magnitude of the field, the charge, and the velocity). Variations on this basic formula describe the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire (sometimes called Laplace force), the electromotive force in a wire loop moving through a magnetic field (an aspect of Faraday's law of induction), and the force on a moving charged particle. Historians suggest that the law is implicit in a paper by James Clerk Maxwell, published in 1865. Hendrik Lorentz arrived at a complete derivation in 1895, identifying the contribution of the electric force a few years after Oliver Heaviside correctly identified the contribution of the magnetic force.
