Screaming Bloody Murder is the fifth studio album by Canadian rock band Sum 41, released on March 29, 2011, after many delays. It is the band's second album produced by frontman Deryck Whibley. It is the band's last album to be released on Island Records before they had fulfilled their contract with the major label in 2016 and their first album not to be released on Aquarius Records, which they left in 2010. The album has received mixed reviews. It is the last album to be released with longtime original drummer, Steve Jocz before he announced his departure from the band in April 2013. Even though new guitarist Tom Thacker was already a part of the band and co-wrote the title track of the album, all guitars were still recorded by singer Deryck Whibley. Despite not playing on the album and being uncredited, Thacker is seen in photos with the band in the album's booklet.
