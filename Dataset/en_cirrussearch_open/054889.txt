The Bukharan People's Soviet Republic (Uzbek: Бухоро Халқ Совет Республикаси, romanized: Buxoro Xalq Sovet Respublikasi; Tajik: Ҷумҳурии Халқии Шӯравии Бухоро, romanized: Jumhurii Xalqii Shūravii Buxoro; Russian: Бухарская Народная Советская Республика, romanized: Bukharskaya Narodnaya Sovetskaya Respublika) was a Soviet state that governed the former Emirate of Bukhara during the years immediately following the Russian Revolution. In 1924, its name was changed to the Bukharan Socialist Soviet Republic (Bukharan SSR; Russian: Бухарская Социалистическая Советская Республика). After the redrawing of regional borders, its territory was assigned mostly to the Uzbek SSR and some to the Turkmen SSR.
