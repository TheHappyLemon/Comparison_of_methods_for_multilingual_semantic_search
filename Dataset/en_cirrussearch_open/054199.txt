The men's standing high jump was a track & field athletics event at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. It was held on July 16, 1900. Three athletes, all from the United States, competed in the standing high jump. The event was won by Ray Ewry of the United States, who took gold in all three of the standing jumps in 1900 (and in both that remained on the programme in each of the 1904, 1906 Intercalated, and 1908 Games). His teammate Irving Baxter earned silver in all three 1900 standing jumps. The American sweep (guaranteed with only Americans competing) was completed with Lewis Sheldon taking bronze.
