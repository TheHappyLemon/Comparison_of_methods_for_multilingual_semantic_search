Hakuto-R Mission 1 was a failed private Japanese uncrewed lunar landing mission built and operated by ispace, which was launched in December 2022 for an attempted lunar landing in April 2023. This first Hakuto mission was primarily a technology demonstrator and carried the Emirates Lunar Mission. Travelling approximately 1,400,000 kilometres (870,000Â mi), it is the furthest a privately-funded spacecraft has traveled. Communication with the lander was lost during the final seconds of its April 2023 descent.
