The Logar Valley (Slovene: Logarska dolina, Logarjeva dolina) is a valley in the Kamnik Alps, in the Municipality of Solčava, Slovenia. The Slovene name for the valley is of relatively recent coinage and is derived from the Logar Farm, which in turn is derived from log (literally, 'swampy meadow'). In 1987, the valley received protected status as a landscape park encompassing 24.75 square kilometres (9.56 sq mi).
