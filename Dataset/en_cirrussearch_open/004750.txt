Tavricheskaya Art School (Russian: Таври́ческое худо́жественно-педагоги́ческое учи́лище) is a secondary art school in Saint Petersburg (Leningrad). From 1919 to 1961, it was located in a building at Tavricheskaya Street, 35. This was the informal name of the art school. From 1930 to 1950, Tavricheskaya Art School played an important role in the preparation of Leningrad artists and the formation of the Leningrad school of painting. In the 20th century, the Tavricheskaya Art School repeatedly altered its official name and address. Since 1992 the art school, which had been called the Saint Petersburg Art School, was renamed after Nicholas Roerich.
