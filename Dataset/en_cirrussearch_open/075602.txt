Pelči Palace (Latvian: Pelču muižas pils; German: Schloss Pelzen) is a palace located in the region of Kurzeme (formerly Courland), in western Latvia. Built during the time of Prince Anatoly Lieven, it is regarded as one of the early Latvian manors which felt the influence of early Art Nouveau, although presently it also shows German Neo-Renaissance, and Baroque features.
