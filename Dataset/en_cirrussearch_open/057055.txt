Orange S.A. (French pronunciation: [ɔʁɑ̃ʒ]), sometimes known as Groupe Orange and formerly known as France Télécom S.A. (stylised as france telecom) is a French multinational telecommunications company. It has 266 million customers worldwide and employs 89,000 people in France and 59,000 people elsewhere. In 2023, the group had a revenue of €43 billion. The company's head office is located in Issy-les-Moulineaux, in the southwestern suburban area of Paris. Orange has been the company's main brand for mobile, landline, internet and Internet Protocol television (IPTV) services since 2006. The Orange brand originated in the United Kingdom in 1994 after Hutchison Whampoa acquired a controlling stake in Microtel Communications: that company became a subsidiary of Mannesmann in 1999 and then was acquired by France Télécom in 2000. The France Télécom company was rebranded to Orange on 1 July 2013. The company has faced criticism due to the Orange S.A. suicides.
