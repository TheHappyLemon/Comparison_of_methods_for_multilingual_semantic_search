Datu Odin Sinsuat, officially the Municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat (Maguindanaon: Inged nu Datu Odin Sinsuat; Jawi: داتو أودين سينسوات; Tagalog: Bayan ng Datu Odin Sinsuat), is a 2nd class municipality and capital of the province of Maguindanao del Norte, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 116,768 people. Datu Odin Sinsuat (Dinaig) was organized as a municipality through Executive Order No. 82 signed by President Manuel Roxas on August 18, 1947. In 1955, the barrio of Upi was separated from Datu Odin Sinsuat to become the town of Upi. The town's name was formerly known as Dinaig. It was changed to Datu Odin Sinsuat in 1994, by virtue of Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 29. The town was part of the province of Shariff Kabunsuan and served as its capital from October 2006 until its nullification by the Supreme Court in July 2008. In 2023, there were proposals to divide the town into three new municipalities; which was met with opposition from Datu Odin Sinsuat's officials. The municipality is home to the Awang Domestic Airport that serves the province and Cotabato City.
