Nili (Dari: نیلی) is the capital city of Nili District in Daykundi Province of Afghanistan. The town of Nili is at 2,022 m altitude. The Nili Airport is located next to the town. The weather conditions in the winter are severe and the roads are difficult. Due to Nili's geographical inaccessibility and acute security problems, it was not until April 2007 that the United Nations opened an office in Nili of UNAMA (United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan). The town lies almost in the geographical center of the country and the Hazarajat region. The entire population of the district and the town consists of the Hazara ethnic group. In December 2008, Ms. Azra Jafari was named by President Hamid Karzai to be the mayor of Nili, thus becoming Afghanistan's first female mayor. The city of Nili has a population of 17,946 (2015 estimate), and has a total land area of 9,022 hectares. There are 1,994 total number of dwellings in Nili city.
