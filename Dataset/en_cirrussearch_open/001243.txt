The Continental Cup (Russian: Кубок Континента, Kubok Kontinenta), also known as the Kontinental Cup, is the trophy presented to the winner of the regular season of the Kontinental Hockey League, i.e. the team with the most points at the end of the regular season. The name and trophy were introduced during the second season of the competition. In the first season it was simply named the regular season winner. During the history of KHL, the winner of Continental Cup had never won Gagarin Cup in the same season before 2018–19, when CSKA Moscow became the first team to win both trophies.
