Tragosoma depsarium is a species of longhorn beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It is the only one of its genus in Europe and is found mainly in cool regions of Northern Europe and Siberia, along with the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountain ranges. This beetle typically lives in open and manageable dry forest areas with old trees. Due to the decline of coniferous forests with a corresponding proportion of old wood, the beetle populations are also declining. In some regions of its range, including Germany, Tragosoma depsarium is considered endangered.
