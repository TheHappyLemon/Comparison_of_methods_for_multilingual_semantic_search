The European route E95 is an imagined route in Europe and a part of the United Nations International E-road network. Approximately 2,527 kilometres (1,570 mi) long, it connects Saint Petersburg with Merzifon in north central Turkey. Between its northern terminus in Russia and its southern end, it passes in addition through Belarus and Ukraine. Between the ports of Odesa / Chornomorsk on Ukraine's southern coast and ports of Turkey (particularly, Samsun) vehicles are required to cross the Black Sea by ferry over a distance of 731 kilometres (454 mi). In Ukraine, the E95 designation is not signed as Ukraine does not number its routes at all except in internal circumstances.
