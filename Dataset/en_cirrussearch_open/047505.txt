Count Władysław Tarnowski (June 4, 1836[disputed – discuss], – April 19, 1878), also known by the pen name Ernest Buława, was a Polish pianist, composer, poet, dramatist, and translator. Tarnowski was born in Wróblewice, administrative district of Drohobycz, in modern day Ukraine, the son of Count Walerian Spycimir Tarnowski and Ernestyna Tarnowska. Recognized as talented at an early age, he was introduced to famed composer Frédéric Chopin. He studied in Lviv and Kraków, with Daniel Auber at the Conservatoire de Paris, with a break during the time of the January Uprising of 1863-64, during which he wrote the song "Jak to na wojence ładnie" ("Isn't the war fun") which remains popular to the modern day, in various alterations. He traveled widely, giving concerts in Wrocław in 1860 and 1875, Vienna, Venice and Florence in 1872, Paris in 1873, and Lviv in 1875. He undertook tours in the Middle East and Asia, living in India, China, and Japan, and died near San Francisco while on the steamer SS Pacific, returning from Japan.
