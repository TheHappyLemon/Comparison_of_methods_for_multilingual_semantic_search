The Nokia 6600 is a mobile phone introduced on 16 June 2003 by Nokia, costing approximately â‚¬600 when released in October 2003. It was Nokia's high-end model of the 6xxx Classic Business Series. At the time of release, it was the most advanced product ever launched by Nokia, and it runs on Symbian OS 7.0s (Series 60 2nd Edition). It also featured a VGA camera, a music player and video player, Bluetooth and extended storage by memory card, being the second non-Communicator to do so (after the Nokia 3650). The model is still[when?] in use in many parts of the world and has proved to be a durable product. By many users it is considered as the trend setter phone which proved to be a bright milestone for its manufacturer. The phone was intended to replace the popular 6310i as the predominant business class model in the Nokia range. It should not be confused with the newer Nokia 6600 fold, Nokia 6600 slide and Nokia 6600i phones which have little resemblance to the original 6600. A variant of the Nokia 6600 was launched in the U.S. market as the Nokia 6620. During its lifespan, the 6600 sold 150 million units, making it one of the most successful phones to date.
