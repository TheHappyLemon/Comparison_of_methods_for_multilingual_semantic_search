Expressway S11 or express road S11 (in Polish droga ekspresowa S11) is a Polish highway which has been planned to run from Kołobrzeg on the Baltic coast through Koszalin, Piła and Poznań to Piekary Śląskie (north of Katowice). Its total planned length is about 556.5 kilometres (346 mi). As of March 2024, several sections serving as bypasses of cities and towns are open to traffic, totalling 120.5 km. A few further sections of the expressway are under construction, but the bulk of it still awaits development. According to the plans, the road should be fully completed by 2030.
