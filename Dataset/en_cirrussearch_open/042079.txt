Bosnia and Herzegovina sent athletes to the Summer Olympic Games under its own flag for the first time in 1992. Bosnian athletes competed under the Yugoslav flag (see Yugoslavia at the Olympics) until the breakup of that country. Along with Albania, Andorra and Monaco, Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of four current European participants that have never won an Olympic medal. The Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed in 1992 and recognized in 1993.
