"Get It Right" is a song performed by the cast of American television series Glee, taken from their sixth soundtrack album, Glee: The Music, Volume 5. It is sung by Lea Michele who portrays the series' lead character, Rachel Berry. The song was written by the series' music producer Adam Anders, who created the song with his wife Nikki Hassman, and writing partner Peer Åström. Anders and company wrote the song specifically for Michele, and based the lyrics on Rachel's storyline. The song was released with a number of Glee songs on the iTunes Store on March 15, 2011. Musically, "Get It Right" is a piano-driven pop ballad, with mild country influences. According to MTV's Aly Semigran, the song has similarities to Britney Spears' "Everytime" (2004). Critics praised Michele's vocals but found the song boring. The lyrics of the song revolve around self-doubt over a lost relationship. The song debuted at number sixteen on the US Billboard Hot 100, and appeared in the top forty in three other countries. The song's performance was featured in the Glee episode "Original Song" which first aired on March 15, 2011 in which Berry (Michele) used a bedazzled microphone, backed by Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz).
