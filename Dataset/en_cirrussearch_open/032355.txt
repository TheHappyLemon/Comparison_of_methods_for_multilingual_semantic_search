The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Chad accepted the convention, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Chad has two World Heritage Sites, both of them in the Ennedi Region.
