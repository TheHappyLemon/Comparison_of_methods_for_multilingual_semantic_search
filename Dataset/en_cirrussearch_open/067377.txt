The dinar (Cyrillic: динар) was the currency of Yugoslavia. It was introduced in 1920 in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was replaced by the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and then the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The dinar was subdivided into 100 para (Cyrillic: пара). One of the successor states to former Yugoslavia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, continued to use the same name for its currency until 2003, though Montenegro stopped exclusively using it in 1999 and moved away from it in 2000. In the early 1990s, economic mismanagement made the government bankrupt and forced it to take money from the savings of the country's citizens. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, this caused severe and prolonged hyperinflation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which has been described as the worst in history. Large amounts of money were printed, with coins becoming redundant and inflation rates reaching over one billion per cent per year. This hyperinflation caused five revaluations between 1990 and 1994; in total there were eight distinct dinari. Six of the eight have been given distinguishing names and separate ISO 4217 codes. The highest denomination banknote was 500 billion dinars, which became worthless a fortnight after it was printed.
