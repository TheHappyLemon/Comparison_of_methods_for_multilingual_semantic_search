Silene viscosa, the white sticky catchfly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to cool-temperate areas of eastern Europe, western Siberia, and western and central Asia, and has been introduced to Germany. Molecular analysis shows that it contains two highly divergent genetic lineages. There is a western lineage and an eastern lineage, suggesting that one is a cryptic species.
