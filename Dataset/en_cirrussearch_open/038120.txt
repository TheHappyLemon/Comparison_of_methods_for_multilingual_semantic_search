The djellaba or jillaba (/dʒɪˈlɑːbə/; Arabic: جلابة; Berber languages: aselham), also written gallabea, is a long, loose-fitting unisex outer robe or dress with full sleeves that is worn in the Maghreb region of North Africa. In central and eastern Algeria it is called qeššaba or qeššabiya. The mountain dwellers of Morocco call it tadjellabit, which is a Berberized form.
