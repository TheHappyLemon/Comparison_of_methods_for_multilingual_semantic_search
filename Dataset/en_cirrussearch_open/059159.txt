Cape Chaplin or Cape Chaplino (Russian: Мыс Чаплина; Mys Chaplina; Eskimo–Aleut: Angazik) is a cape pointing eastward in the Bering Sea in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of the Russian Federation. The area was first surveyed described and mapped by Russian mariner Count Fyodor Petrovich Litke during the First Kamchatka Expedition and it was named by Litke in honor of midshipman Peter Avraamovich Chaplin, a member of the expedition.
