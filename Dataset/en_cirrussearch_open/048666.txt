North Macedonia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation's third consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics in the post-Yugoslav era. The Olympic Committee of North Macedonia selected a team of ten athletes, seven men and three women, to compete in five different sports at these Olympic Games. Seven of them had previously competed in Sydney, including slalom kayaker Lazar Popovski, who became the first Macedonian athlete to compete in four editions of the Olympic Games (although he first appeared in 1992 as part of the Independent Olympic Participants), and freestyle wrestler Mogamed Ibragimov, who won the bronze in the men's 84Â kg class. Former basketball player, 1976 Olympic silver medalist, and assistant coach Blagoja Georgievski was appointed by the committee to carry the Macedonian flag in the opening ceremony. North Macedonia left Athens without receiving a single Olympic medal for the first time since the nation made its Olympic debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
