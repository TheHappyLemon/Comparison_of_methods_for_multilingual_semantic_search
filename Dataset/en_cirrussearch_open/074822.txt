Herluf Bidstrup (10 September 1912 â€“ 26 December 1988) was a Danish cartoonist and illustrator. Bidstrup was educated as a painter at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and throughout his career he authored more than 5,000 cartoons. He was a firm supporter of communism and very much concerned with the international affairs of his time and social satire. However, not all his work revolves around politics and ideology.
