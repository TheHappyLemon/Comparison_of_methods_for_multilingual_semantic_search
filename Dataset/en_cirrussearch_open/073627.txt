The Luxembourg Grand Prix (German: Großer Preis von Luxemburg) was the name given to two races of the FIA Formula One World Championship, held in 1997 and 1998. Both races were held in Germany at the Nürburgring, which is located some 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the Germany–Luxembourg border. The Luxembourg title was chosen in 1997 despite the race being held in Germany and not in Luxembourg's own territory as the Hockenheimring was already contracted to host the German Grand Prix. The Nürburgring had previously hosted the European Grand Prix in 1995 and 1996, but it was renamed due to other changes in the 1997 schedule. Following the cancellation of the Portuguese Grand Prix, a second race in Spain was added, with Jerez hosting the European Grand Prix along with the Spanish Grand Prix at Barcelona. Jerez was due to host the race again in 1998, but the rights to the European Grand Prix had been revoked from the organisers of the race after an incident on the podium in 1997. In 1999 the Nürburgring race returned to using the European Grand Prix title, which it held every year until 2007.
