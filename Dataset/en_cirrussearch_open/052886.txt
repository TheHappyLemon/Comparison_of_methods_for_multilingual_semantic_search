The Sozh (Belarusian: Сож, romanized: Sož, IPA: [sɔʐ]; Russian: Сож; Ukrainian: Сож) is a river flowing in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. It is a left bank tributary of the Dnieper. The Sozh passes through Gomel, the second largest city in Belarus. The river is crossed by the Sozh Floating Bridge at Korma and an elegant steel arch at Gomel, which is featured on a Rbls 300 national stamp.
