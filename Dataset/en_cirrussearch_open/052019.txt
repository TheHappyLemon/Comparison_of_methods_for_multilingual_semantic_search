Chibi (Chinese: 赤壁; pinyin: Chìbì) is a county-level city in southeastern Hubei province, China. Neighboring Wuhan in the north and Yueyang in the south, Chibi is called the "South Gate of Hubei". It is under the administration of Xianning prefecture-level city. Chibi was called Puqi (蒲圻; Púqí) until 11 June 1998, when the State Council approved its renaming to "Chibi" since it was the site of the famous Battle of Chibi that took place in the winter of 208/9 CE. Chibi has an area of 1,723 square kilometres (665 sq mi) and a population of 506,509 as of 2006.
