Platypezidae is a family of true flies of the superfamily Platypezoidea. The more than 250 species are found worldwide primarily in woodland habitats. A common name is flat-footed flies, but this is also used for the closely related Opetiidae which were formerly included in the Platypezidae. Some genera formerly included here have been recognized as entirely unrelated, and now placed in the asilomorph family Atelestidae.
