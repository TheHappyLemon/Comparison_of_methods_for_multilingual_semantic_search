The Transnistrian ruble (alternatively rubla or rouble; Romanian: rublă transnistreană; Russian: приднестровский рубль; Ukrainian: придністровський рубль) is the currency of the internationally unrecognized state of Transnistria and is divided into 100 kopecks. Since Transnistria is a polity with no credible international recognition and its territory is formally part of Moldova, its currency has no ISO 4217 code, and thus Transnistria cannot participate in any global card payment processing network. Cards are accepted, but only on the Russian developed MIR network. However, unofficially some Transnistrian organisations, such as Agroprombank and Gazprombank, used the code PRB, a code reserved for Puerto Rico (ISO 3166-1 country code "PR"). The Transnistrian Republican Bank sometimes uses the code RUP, a code reserved for Russia (ISO 3166-1 country code "RU").
