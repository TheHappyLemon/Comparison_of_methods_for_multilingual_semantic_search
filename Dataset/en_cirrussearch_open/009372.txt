Latgalian pottery (Latgalian: Latgolys pūdnīceiba, Latvian: Latgales podniecība) or Latgalian ceramics (Latgolys keramika, Latgales keramika), also known as Silajāņi ceramics is the best-known subset of Latvian pottery. The region of Latgale historically has been the most prolific producer of wares. Latgalian ceramics rose to the popularity in the Soviet period, when art historian Jānis Pujāts wrote books about the best Latgalian ceramicists and organized several exhibitions to showcase their works.
