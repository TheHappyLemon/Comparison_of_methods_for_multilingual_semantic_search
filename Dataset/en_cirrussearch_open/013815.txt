Gyromitra esculenta /ˌdʒaɪroʊˈmaɪtrə ˌɛskjəˈlɛntə, ˌdʒɪrə-/ is an ascomycete fungus from the genus Gyromitra, widely distributed across Europe and North America. It normally fruits in sandy soils under coniferous trees in spring and early summer. The fruiting body, or mushroom, is an irregular brain-shaped cap dark brown in colour that can reach 10 centimetres (4 inches) high and 15 cm (6 in) wide, perched on a stout white stipe up to 6 cm (2+1⁄2 in) high. Although potentially fatal if eaten raw (causing restrictions on its sales in some areas), G. esculenta is still commonly parboiled for consumption, being a popular delicacy in Europe and the upper Great Lakes region of North America; evidence suggests that cooking does not eliminate all toxins. When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine, which affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma, and death after five to seven days.
