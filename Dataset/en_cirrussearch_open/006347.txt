The Vaps Movement (Estonian: Eesti Vabadussõjalaste Keskliit, later Eesti Vabadussõjalaste Liit, vabadussõjalased, or colloquially vapsid, a single member of this movement was called vaps) was an Estonian political organization. Founded in 1929, it emerged as a mass anti-communist and populist movement from the Union of Participants in the Estonian War of Independence, an association of veterans of the Estonian War of Independence (1918–1920). The leaders of this association were Andres Larka (formal figurehead and presidential candidate) and Artur Sirk.
