The men's 10 kilometres was one of the five track cycling races on the Cycling at the 1896 Summer Olympics programme. It was held on 11 April and comprised 30 laps of the track. The 1896 Games was the only time that the 10 kilometres track race was part of the cycling program at an Olympic Games. Six cyclists from four nations competed. The event was won by Paul Masson of France, the second of his three victories that day (he had previously won the sprint and would shortly afterwards win the track time trial). His countryman LÃ©on Flameng finished second, while Austrian Adolf Schmal was third.
