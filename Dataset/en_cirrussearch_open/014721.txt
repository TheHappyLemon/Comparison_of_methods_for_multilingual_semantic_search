Akaganeite, also written as the deprecated Akaganéite, is a chloride-containing iron(III) oxide-hydroxide mineral, formed by the weathering of pyrrhotite (Fe1−xS). Akaganeite is often described as the β phase of anhydrous ferric oxyhydroxide FeOOH, but some chloride (or fluoride) ions are normally included in the structure, so a more accurate formula is FeO 0.833(OH) 1.167Cl 0.167.Nickel may substitute for iron, yielding the more general formula (Fe3+ ,Ni2+ ) 8(OH,O) 16Cl 1.25 Akaganeite has a metallic luster and a brownish yellow streak. Its crystal structure is monoclinic and similar to that of hollandite BaMn 8O 16, characterised by the presence of tunnels parallel to the c-axis of the tetragonal lattice. These tunnels are partially occupied by chloride anions that give to the crystal its structural stability.
