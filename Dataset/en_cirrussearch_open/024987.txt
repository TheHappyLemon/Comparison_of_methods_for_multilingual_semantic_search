An atlas is a collection of maps; it is typically a bundle of maps of Earth or of a continent or region of Earth. Atlases have traditionally been bound into book form, but today, many atlases are in multimedia formats. In addition to presenting geographical features and political boundaries, many atlases often feature geopolitical, social, religious, and economic statistics. They also have information about the map and places in it.
