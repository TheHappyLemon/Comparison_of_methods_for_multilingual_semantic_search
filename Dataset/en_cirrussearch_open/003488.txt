"Whatcha Think About That" is a song recorded by American girl group the Pussycat Dolls for their second studio album, Doll Domination (2008). The song features a guest appearance from American rapper Missy Elliott, who co-wrote it with the song's producer Polow da Don, Ester Dean, and MickaÃ«l Furnon, who received songwriting credit due to his work being sampled. It was released on September 9, 2008, as the album's second single in the United States and on February 23, 2009, as the third single in the United Kingdom. The electropop and R&B midtempo song samples "Je m'appelle Jane" by Jane Birkin and is built on a bhangra-inspired guitar riff. Lyrically, the Pussycat Dolls reverse roles towards an overbearing and controlling partner. Elliott references American singer Katy Perry and her song "I Kissed a Girl". The song received moderate reviews from music critics; some praised the production and Elliott's contribution, while others had the opposite opinion. "Whatcha Think About That" did not enter the US Billboard Hot 100 but peaked at number eight on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The song peaked at number 12 in Ireland and number nine in the UK, where it received a silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). An accompanying music video was directed by Diane Martel and was released on October 6, 2008. It depicts the group performing Fosse-inspired choreography in a burlesque lounge. The Pussycat Dolls performed the song for a few televised appearances and on their 2009 Doll Domination Tour.
