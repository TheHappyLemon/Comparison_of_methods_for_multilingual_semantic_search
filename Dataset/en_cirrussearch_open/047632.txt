Look up diminutive in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. A diminutive is a word obtained by modifying a root word to convey a slighter degree of its root meaning, either to convey the smallness of the object or quality named, or to convey a sense of intimacy or endearment, and sometimes to derogatorily belittle something or someone. A diminutive form (abbreviated DIM) is a word-formation device used to express such meanings. A double diminutive is a diminutive form with two diminutive suffixes rather than one.
