Juan Carlos Ferrero Donat (Spanish pronunciation: [xwaŋ ˈkaɾlos feˈreɾo ðoˈnat]; born 12 February 1980) is a Spanish former world No. 1 tennis player and current tennis coach. He won the men's singles title at the 2003 French Open, and in September of that year became the 21st player to hold the top ranking, which he held for eight weeks. He was runner-up at the 2002 French Open and 2003 US Open and won 16 ATP Tour titles, including four Masters events. He was nicknamed "Mosquito" for his speed and slender physical build. Ferrero retired from professional tennis following the 2012 Valencia Open. He has since been a tennis coach to two-time ATP Finals champion and Olympic gold medalist Alexander Zverev, and to US Open and Wimbledon champion and world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz.
