Anti-Flag was an American punk rock band formed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1988. The band was known for its left-wing political activism. For the majority of the band's career, their members included Justin Sane (vocals and guitar), Chris Head (guitar), Pat Thetic (drums), and Chris Barker, also known as Chris No. 2 (vocals and bass). Gaining popularity through the punk underground, Anti-Flag controversially signed to RCA Records and released their major label debut For Blood and Empire in 2006. It contained singles such as "The Press Corpse" (which was the band's only appearance on the US Alternative Airplay chart) and "This is the End (For You My Friend)", which featured in multiple video games. The band remained active past their commercial peak, releasing a total of thirteen albums, the final of which came out months before their disbandment. The band also operated their own record label, A-F Records. Anti-Flag suddenly broke up in July 2023 amidst several rape and sexual assault allegations made against Sane. The other members directly condemned him and ceased all operations. Months later, Sane was sued for raping a fan in 2010.
