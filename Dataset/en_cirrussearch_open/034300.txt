The pungi (Hindi: पुंगी, Urdu: پُنگی, Burmese: ပုန်ဂိ), bīn (Hindi: बीन) or Murli (Sindhi: مُورلي) is a musical instrument that originates from the Indian subcontinent. The instrument consists of a reservoir into which air is blown and then channelled into two reed pipes. It is played with no pauses, as the player employs circular breathing. In street performances, the pungi is used for snake charming.
