The Vienna Ring Road (German: Ringstraße, pronounced [ʁɪŋˌʃtʁaːsə] , lit. ring road) is a 5.3 km (3.3 mi) circular grand boulevard that serves as a ring road around the historic Innere Stadt (Inner Town) district of Vienna, Austria. The road is located on sites where medieval city fortifications once stood, including high walls and the broad open field ramparts (glacis), criss-crossed by paths that lay before them. It was constructed after the dismantling of the city walls in the mid-19th century. From the 1860s to 1890s, many large public buildings were erected along the Ringstrasse in an eclectic historicist style, sometimes called Ringstraßenstil ("Ring Road style"), using elements of Classical, Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque architecture. Because of its architectural beauty and history, the Vienna Ringstrasse has been called the "Lord of the ring roads" and is designated by UNESCO as part of Vienna's World Heritage Site.
