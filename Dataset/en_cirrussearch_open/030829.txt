An Open Game (or Double King's Pawn Opening) is a generic term for a family of chess openings beginning with the moves: 1. e4 e5 White has moved the king's pawn two squares and Black has replied in kind. The result is an Open Game. Other responses to 1.e4 are termed Semi-Open Games or Single King's Pawn Games. When written in lowercase, the term "open game" refers to a chess position where ranks, files and diagonals are open, and tending to more tactical gameplay. It is possible that an Open Game may lead to a closed game. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
