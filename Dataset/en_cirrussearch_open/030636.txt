The Bogo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves: 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Bb4+ The position after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 is common. The traditional move for White here is 3.Nc3, threatening to set up a big pawn centre with 4.e4. However, 3.Nf3 is often played instead as a way of avoiding the Nimzo-Indian Defence (which would follow after 3.Nc3 Bb4). After 3.Nf3, Black usually plays 3...b6 (the Queen's Indian Defence) or 3...d5 (transposing to the Queen's Gambit Declined), but can instead play 3...Bb4+, the Bogo-Indian Defence. Databases suggest that the Bogo-Indian is played approximately half as often as the Queen's Indian. The Bogo-Indian Defence can also arise via the move order 1.d4 e6 2.c4 Bb4+, the Keres Defence. The Bogo-Indian is classified as E11 by the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO). This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
