The Tiergarten (German: [ˈtiːɐ̯ˌɡaʁtn̩] , English: Animal Garden), formal German name: Großer Tiergarten (English: Greater Animal Garden, or deer park, game hunting park) is Berlin’s most popular inner-city park, located completely in the district of the same name. The park is 210 hectares (520 acres) in size and is among the largest urban gardens of Germany. Only the Tempelhofer Park (previously Berlin's Tempelhof airport) and Munich's Englischer Garten are larger.
