This is a list of governorates of the Russian Empire (Russian: губерния, pre-1918: губернія, romanized: guberniya) established between the administrative reform of 1708 and the establishment of the Kholm Governorate in 1912 (inclusive). Some of these governorates persisted into the Soviet era (renamed oblasts during the 1920s), while others were subdivided further as part of the policy of "unbundling" (разукрупнение, razukrupneniye) of the 1930s. During the partitions of Poland (in the 1780s), many governorates were replaced with viceroyalties, but later (before the 1800s) were reverted to governorates.
