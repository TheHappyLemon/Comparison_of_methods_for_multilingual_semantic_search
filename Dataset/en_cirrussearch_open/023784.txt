Pervomaisk (Ukrainian: Первомайськ; Russian: Первомайск) is a city in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, Luhansk Oblast, on the left bank of the Luhan River. Pervomaisk is 71 kilometres (44 mi), by road, from Luhansk, 133 kilometres (83 mi) from Izvarino, where there was formerly an international border between Ukraine and Russia, and 736km from Kyiv. Pervomaisk came under the control of the breakaway pro-Russia Luhansk People's Republic (LPR / LNR) in early 2014. In 2014, and 2015, the city would be a focal point of the war in Donbas, sustaining severe destruction in conflict. Following their 2022 annexation referendum, Russia claimed the entire Luhansk Oblast, including Pervomaisk, as part of their LPR / LNR. The population of Pervomaisk is 36,091 (2022 estimate).
