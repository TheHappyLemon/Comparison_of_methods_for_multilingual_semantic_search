Alexandre Millerand (French: [alɛksɑ̃dʁ milʁɑ̃]; (1859-02-10)10 February 1859 – (1943-04-06)6 April 1943) was a French politician. He was Prime Minister of France from 20 January to 23 September 1920 and President of France from 23 September 1920 to 11 June 1924. His participation in Waldeck-Rousseau's cabinet at the start of the 20th century, alongside the Marquis de Galliffet, who had directed the repression of the 1871 Paris Commune, sparked a debate in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) and in the Second International about the participation of socialists in bourgeois governments. In 1912 Millerand was appointed as war minister in Poincaré’s cabinet. He returned to the same post during the first year of World War I, helping set French war strategy. After Clemenceau’s defeat in 1920, Millerand formed a cabinet and held both the premiership and the ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1920-1924 he served as president of France. He faced criticism for openly supporting conservative candidates in the 1924 elections and the left majority forced his resignation. Thereafter he played only a minor role in politics.
