Mazar-e-Sharif International Airport (Dari: میدان هوائی مزار شریف, Meydâne Havâyeye Mazâre Šarif; Pashto: مزار شریف نړیوال هوايي ډګر) (IATA: MZR, ICAO: OAMS), officially called Mawlana Jalaluddin Mohammad Balkhi International Airport, is located about 9 km (5.6 mi) east of Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, which is around 15 minutes of driving distance from the center of the city. Situated at an elevation of 1,259 ft (384 m) above sea level, the airport has one asphalt runway measuring around 9,836 ft × 170 ft (2,998 m × 52 m) and several taxiways, and facilities for up to 1,000 passengers. It serves much of the population of northern Afghanistan. In 2013, a sixty million euro terminal was added to the airport while the older terminal is now used for domestic flights. Though originally constructed with 2 parallel runways, the airport's northernmost runway has since been converted into a taxiway, making it one of the largest airports in Afghanistan. The Mazar-i-Sharif rail terminal is located to the east of the airport, which is connected to the Hairatan border town in the north. The Ministry of Defense also has a military base adjacent to the airport. Other nearby airports include Kunduz Airport in Kunduz Province to the east; Kabul International Airport in Kabul Province to the southeast; Bamyan Airport in Bamyan Province to the south; and Sheberghan Airport in Jowzjan Province to the west.
