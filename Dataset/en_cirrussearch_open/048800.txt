The coat of arms of the Republic of Kosovo was introduced following the unilateral declaration of independence on 17 February 2008. It shows six white stars in an arc above a solid golden shape of Kosovo as seen on a standard projection map, placed on a rounded triangular shield with a blue field and a golden border. Its central figures, the stars and the shape, are also the content of the new blue flag of Kosovo, adopted at the same time. A golden map of Kosovo on a blue field surmounted by stars were also featured on the emblem used when Kosovo was administered by the United Nations.
