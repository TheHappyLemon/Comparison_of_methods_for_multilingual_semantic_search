Cameron Bruce Crowe (born July 13, 1957) is an American filmmaker and journalist. He has received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and Grammy Award as well as a nomination for a Tony Award. Crowe started his career as a contributing editor and writer at Rolling Stone magazine in 1973 where he covered numerous rock bands on tour. Crowe's debut screenwriting effort, Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), grew out of a book he wrote while posing for one year undercover as a student at Clairemont High School in San Diego. Later, he wrote and directed the romance films Say Anything... (1989), Singles (1992), and Jerry Maguire (1996). Crowe directed his seminal work, the autobiographical film Almost Famous (2000), which is loosely based on his early career as a teen writer for Rolling Stone. For his screenplay, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. His later films have received varying degrees of success. He directed the psychological thriller Vanilla Sky (2001), the romantic comedy Elizabethtown (2005), the family-friendly We Bought a Zoo (2011), and the romantic comedy Aloha (2015). He has directed the music documentaries Pearl Jam Twenty (2011) and The Union (2011), produced David Crosby: Remember My Name (2019), and created the Showtime series Roadies (2016). Crowe has written two books, Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1981) and Conversations with Wilder (1999). He also adapted Almost Famous into a stage musical on Broadway in 2022, for which he received a Tony Award for Best Original Score nomination.
