Chashma Barrage is a barrage on the River Indus in the Mianwali District of the Punjab province of Pakistan. It is 304 km northwest of Lahore and 56 km downstream of Jinnah Barrage. The contract for Chashma Barrage works was awarded on 10 February, 1967, to French Consortium Société Dumez and Société Borie and was successfully completed by 25 March, 1971. The total cost of Chashma Barrage works was Rs.399 million but power generation started later in 2001. The installed capacity of power station is 184 MW, from eight Kaplan-type bulb turbine units, each with a 23 MW capacity.[citation needed] The bulb turbines have been installed for the first time in Pakistan. The first unit was commissioned in January 2001, while final commissioning of all units was completed in July 2001. The 8 Kaplan-type turbines and synchronous generator units were made by Fuji, Japan. Chashma Barrage is used for irrigation, flood control and power generation. A Ramsar site is located nearby.
