The 2015 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2014–15 season and the conclusion of the season's playoffs played from June 4 to 16, 2015. It was contested by the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors and the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers. The Warriors, led by the duo of Klay Thompson and 2014–15 MVP Stephen Curry, won the opening game at home in overtime. However, despite the loss of an injured Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving during most of the series, the Cavaliers, led by LeBron James (in his fifth consecutive Finals appearance, and sixth overall) managed to take a 2–1 series lead before the Warriors won the last three for their first title since 1975. Golden State's Andre Iguodala was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP). Iguodala received 7 of the 11 votes, with James receiving the other 4. James also became the first player in NBA Finals history to lead both teams in points, assists, and rebounds for the entire series. This is the last NBA Finals to be played on a Thursday–Sunday–Tuesday scheme, with the schedule format being changed beginning the following Finals.
