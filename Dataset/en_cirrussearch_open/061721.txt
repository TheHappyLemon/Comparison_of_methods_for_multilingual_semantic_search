The National Harmony Party (Latvian: Tautas Saskaņas partija, TSP; Russian: Партия народного согласия) was a political party in Latvia. The party identified with social democracy. It supported further liberalisation of Latvian nationality law by granting citizenship to non-citizens who had lived in Latvia for at least 10 years. (The present law only allows Soviet-era migrants to apply for citizenship through a process of naturalization). It also supported expanding education in minority languages, particularly Russian.
