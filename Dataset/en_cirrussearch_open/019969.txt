In mathematics, a cube root of a number x is a number y such that y3 = x. All nonzero real numbers have exactly one real cube root and a pair of complex conjugate cube roots, and all nonzero complex numbers have three distinct complex cube roots. For example, the real cube root of 8, denoted 83{\displaystyle {\sqrt[{3}]{8}}}, is 2, because 23 = 8, while the other cube roots of 8 are −1+i3{\displaystyle -1+i{\sqrt {3}}} and −1−i3{\displaystyle -1-i{\sqrt {3}}}. The three cube roots of −27i are: 3i,332−32i,and−332−32i.{\displaystyle 3i,\quad {\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}-{\frac {3}{2}}i,\quad {\text{and}}\quad -{\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}-{\frac {3}{2}}i.} In some contexts, particularly when the number whose cube root is to be taken is a real number, one of the cube roots (in this particular case the real one) is referred to as the principal cube root, denoted with the radical sign   3.{\displaystyle {\sqrt[{3}]{~^{~}}}.} The cube root is the inverse function of the cube function if considering only real numbers, but not if considering also complex numbers: although one has always (x3)3=x,{\displaystyle \left({\sqrt[{3}]{x}}\right)^{3}=x,} the cube of a nonzero number has more than one complex cube root and its principal cube root may not be the number that was cubed. For example, (−1+i3)3=8{\displaystyle (-1+i{\sqrt {3}})^{3}=8}, but 83=2.{\displaystyle {\sqrt[{3}]{8}}=2.}
