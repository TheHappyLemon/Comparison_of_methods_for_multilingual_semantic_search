The province of Cuneo (Italian: provincia di Cuneo; Piedmontese: provincia ëd Coni) is a province in the Piedmont region of Italy. To the west, it borders the French region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (departments of Alpes-Maritimes, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Hautes-Alpes), to the north the Metropolitan City of Turin, to the east the province of Asti and to the south the Ligurian provinces of Savona and Imperia. It is also known as la Provincia Granda (Piedmontese for 'The Big Province'), because it is the largest province in Piedmont and the fourth-largest in Italy (following Sassari, South Tyrol and Foggia). Briga Marittima and Tenda were part of this province before their cession to France in 1947.
