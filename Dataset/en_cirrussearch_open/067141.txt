The Russo-Swedish War of 1495â€“1497, known in Sweden as the Stures' Russian War (Swedish: Sturarnas ryska krig), was a border war which occurred between the Grand Duchy of Moscow and the Kingdom of Sweden. Although the war was relatively short, and did not lead to any territorial changes, it has significance as the first war between Sweden and Moscow. Sweden earlier fought wars against the Novgorod Republic, before Novgorod was formally annexed to Moscow in 1478.
