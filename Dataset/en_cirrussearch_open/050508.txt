Triglav National Park (TNP; Slovene: Triglavski narodni park, TNP) is the only national park in Slovenia. It was established in its modern form in 1981 and is located in the northwestern part of the country, respectively the southeastern part of the Alpine massif. Mount Triglav, the highest peak of the Julian Alps, stands almost in the middle of the national park. From there the valleys spread out radially, supplying water to two large river systems with their sources in the Julian Alps: the Soƒça and the Sava, flowing to the Adriatic and Black Sea, respectively.
