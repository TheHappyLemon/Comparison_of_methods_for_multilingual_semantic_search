Juan Pablo Montoya Roldán (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈxwam ˈpaβlo monˈtoʝa rolˈdan]; born 20 September 1975), is a Colombian racing driver who has competed in open-wheel car, sports car and stock car racing events. He won the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) Drivers' Championship in 1999; the Indianapolis 500 in 2000 and 2015; the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2007, 2008 and 2013 and the IMSA SportsCar Championship in 2019. Montoya began kart racing at the age of five, and had early success before progressing to car racing in Colombia and Mexico at age 17, finishing runner-up in the Copa Formula Renault and winning the Nationale Tournement Swift GTI Championship. He also competed in the Barber Saab Pro Series, the Formula Vauxhall Lotus Championship and the British Formula 3 Championship. In 1997 and 1998, Montoya raced in the International Formula 3000 for RSM Marko and then Super Nova Racing, winning seven races and the 1998 Drivers' Championship. He debuted in CART in 1999 with Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR), tying Dario Franchitti on points but claimed the title because of count-back on the number of victories taken by both drivers. During the 2000 season, Montoya's form lowered due to unreliability but still won three races for ninth in the Drivers' Championship and won the Indianapolis 500 on his first attempt. He first drove in Formula One (F1) with the Williams team in the 2001 season and secured his maiden victory in that year's Italian Grand Prix. Montoya qualified on pole position seven times in the 2002 championship and won two races in the 2003 season that put him third in the World Drivers' Championship in both years. He fell to fifth in the 2004 World Drivers' Championship but won the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix. At the start of the 2005 season, Montoya moved to McLaren and finished fourth with three victories. The 2006 season resulted in him leaving F1 after that year's United States Grand Prix and began competing in NASCAR for CGR in late 2006. During his seven-year NASCAR career, Montoya won the 2007 Telcel-Motorola Mexico 200, the 2007 Toyota/Save Mart 350 and the 2010 Heluva Good! Sour Cream Dips at the Glen. He qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup in 2009 and finished a career-high eighth in that season's points standings. For the 2014 season, Montoya switched to the IndyCar Series with Team Penske and took one win before claiming two victories in 2015 (including the Indianapolis 500) and tying CGR's Scott Dixon in points but finishing second because of count-back on the number of wins taken by both drivers. His final series victory came in 2016 before going part-time in 2017 onwards and making his IMSA debut at the 2017 Petit Le Mans. Paired with Dane Cameron, Montoya qualified on pole once and was fifth in the Prototype drivers' standings before winning three races the following year to claim the series title. He fell to seventh in the 2020 season and was fourth in the FIA World Endurance Championship's LMP2 Pro-Am subcategory with DragonSpeed USA in 2021. Montoya has also won the 6 Hours of Bogotá three times as well as the individual event of the Race of Champions in 2017.
