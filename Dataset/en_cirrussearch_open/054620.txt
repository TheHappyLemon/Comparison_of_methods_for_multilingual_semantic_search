David Joshua Rubin (born June 26, 1976) is an American libertarian-conservative political commentator. He is the creator and host of The Rubin Report, a political talk show on YouTube and on the network BlazeTV. Launched in 2013, his show was originally part of TYT Network, until he left in 2015, in part due to widening ideological differences. Previously, Rubin hosted LGBT-themed talk shows, including The Ben and Dave Show from 2007 to 2008 and The Six Pack from 2009 to 2012, both of which he co-hosted with Ben Harvey. Rubin has written two books. Rubin originally considered himself to be a progressive while part of The Young Turks. However, Rubin has written that his views began to change after witnessing progressive commentator and former colleague Cenk Uygur's criticisms of Fox News commentator David Webb, Ben Affleck's confrontation with Bill Maher and Sam Harris over their views on Islam, and the political left's response to the Charlie Hebdo shooting. Rubin then described himself as a classical liberal, but has since stated that he has become a conservative, later embracing libertarianism.[citation needed] Rubin has become a staunch critic of progressivism, the political left, and the Democratic Party. In 2022, Rubin registered as a Republican in Florida.
