The 1944 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XIII Olympiad, was a planned international multi-sport event scheduled to have been held from July to August 1944 in London, England, United Kingdom. The games were canceled due to World War II alongside the 1944 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, and were the fifth games to be canceled due to war. However, unofficial celebrations went ahead anyway in Switzerland as well as by Polish prisoners of war held in Nazi-occupied Poland. The games eventually took place in London in 1948, and would later host the 2012 Summer Olympics.
