Hot Fuzz is a 2007 buddy cop action comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg, who stars in the lead role, alongside Nick Frost, Timothy Dalton and Jim Broadbent. The film centres on two cops investigating a series of mysterious gruesome deaths in a West Country village. It is the second and most successful film in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, succeeding Shaun of the Dead (2004) and followed by The World's End (2013). Over 100 action films were used as inspiration for developing the script. Principal photography took place in Wells, Somerset for eleven weeks and ten artists worked on VFX, which involved explosions, gory gunfire scenes and a flip book. Released on 16 February 2007 in the United Kingdom and 20 April in the United States, Hot Fuzz received critical acclaim and became a box office success, grossing US$80 million worldwide against a budget of $12â€“16 million. In 2020, Empire named it the 67th greatest film of the 21st century.
