.uz is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Uzbekistan. Registry services were formerly operated by Euracom GmBH, but were later redelegated to UZINFOCOM. Registrations are taken directly at the second level, but the former registry also advertised the availability of registrations at the third level beneath co.uz and com.uz, and some domain names under other second-level names such as org.uz also exist. In Latvia, .uz is used as short-link address â€” ej.uz, which means "go to".[citation needed] .uz has an A record and had a HTTP server since at least 1997.
