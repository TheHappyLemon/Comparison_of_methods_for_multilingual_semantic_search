Casa Vini Caldirola (or the Caldirola Wine House) sponsored an Italian professional road bicycle racing team between 1998 and 2004, with a gap in 2002, where the main sponsor was Tacconi Sport. In 2005 the team was formally disbanded, but many riders continued in the new Liquigas-Bianchi UCI ProTour team.
