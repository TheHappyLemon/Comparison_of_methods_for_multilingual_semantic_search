Marja Kubašec (German: Maria Kubasch; (1890-03-07)7 March 1890 – (1976-04-13)13 April 1976) was a Sorbian writer who is considered by literary historians to be the first woman to write novels in Upper Sorbian. Working as a schoolteacher, she wrote theatre plays, short stories, biographies, and novels dealing with the history of the Sorbian people. Born into a family of farmers in a village near Bautzen in the German Empire, she completed her teacher training in 1911 with a focus on history and foreign languages at the Ursulinenkloster Erfurt [de]. Save for a brief period after the Second World War, she taught in a succession of schools in Saxony until the end of her working life in 1956. During her retirement, Kubašec focused increasingly on her writing. Her first literary production was Wusadny ('The Outcast'), a serial novella published in a newspaper between 1922 and 1923. She published her first dramatic work in 1926, a historical play entitled Chodojta ('The Witch'). A collection of short stories, Row w serbskej holi ('The Grave in the Sorbian Heath') appeared in 1949. The collection's eponymous story relates the execution of a Polish forced labourer who had fallen in love with a Sorbian woman during the war. Her later works include two biographies of Sorbian members of the resistance to the Third Reich. Her writings were honoured with several prizes, among which the 1975 Johannes-R.-Becher-Medaille.
