There are a total of 16 bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton tracks around the world in use for competitions. All of the current tracks on this list are constructed of reinforced concrete and use artificial refrigeration to keep the track cool enough during early and late season to hold ice. St. Moritz, Switzerland is the exception, as it is carved into the snowpack each year. The IBSF is the governing body for racing with the sports of Bobsled and Skeleton while the FIL is the governing body for racing with Luge.
