The AfroBasket (alternatively known as the FIBA Africa Championship, FIBA African Championship, or FIBA AfroBasket) is the men's basketball continental championship contested by the senior national teams of Africa, played once every four years. Through the 2015 edition, the tournament took place every two years and also served as a qualifying tournament for the FIBA World Cup and the Summer Olympic Games. However, since 2017, the AfroBasket along with all other men's FIBA continental championships are no longer a part of the qualifying process for the World Cup or the Olympics.
