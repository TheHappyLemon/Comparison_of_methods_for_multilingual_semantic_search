In his 25-year-long playing career, Király spent most of his career in Germany and England. He signed for Hertha BSC in 1997, going on to appear in 198 official games, and played for 1860 Munich later in his career. In England, he represented Crystal Palace, Burnley, and Fulham and had loan spells with West Ham United, and Aston Villa. In 2015, he re-joined his hometown team Szombathelyi Haladás. Since making his international debut against Austria in 1998, Király amassed a record 108 caps for the Hungary national team. He represented his nation at UEFA Euro 2016, and on 14 June 2016, he became the oldest player to represent their country at a UEFA European Championship at 40 years and 74 days, beating the previous record of 39 years and 91 days held by Lothar Matthäus. The record was later extended to 40 years and 86 days on 26 June 2016. Király retired from international football after the tournament. Throughout his career, Király was known for wearing a recognisable pair of grey tracksuit bottoms instead of shorts in almost every match he played.
