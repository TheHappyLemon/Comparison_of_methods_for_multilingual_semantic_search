Doumer Island is an island 8.3 km (4.5 nmi) long and 3.7 km (2 nmi) wide, surmounted by a snow-covered pyramidal peak, 515 m (1,690 ft), lying between the south portions of Anvers Island and Wiencke Island in the Palmer Archipelago of Antarctica. It was first seen by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition, 1897–99, under Adrien de Gerlache. It was resighted and charted by the French Antarctic Expedition, 1903–05, under Jean-Baptiste Charcot, who named it for Paul Doumer, President of the French Chamber of Deputies and later President of France.
