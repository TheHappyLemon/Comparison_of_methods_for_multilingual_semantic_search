The total length of the network managed by CFM (as of 2009) is 1,232 kilometres (766 mi), of which 1,218 kilometres (757 mi) are 1,520 mm (4 ft 11+27⁄32 in) (broad gauge), and 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) are 1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) (standard gauge). The entire network is single track and is not electrified. It borders the Romanian railway network, with a 1,520 mm (4 ft 11+27⁄32 in)/1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) break-of-gauge in the west, and the Ukrainian one in the east.
