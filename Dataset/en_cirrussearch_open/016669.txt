Chaïm Soutine (Russian: Хаим Соломонович Сутин, Khaïm Solomonovitch Sutin; Yiddish: חײם סוטין, Ḥaïm Soutin; 13 January 1893 – 9 August 1943) was a French painter of Belarusian-Jewish origin of the School of Paris, who made a major contribution to the expressionist movement while living and working in Paris. Inspired by classic painting in the European tradition, exemplified by the works of Rembrandt, Chardin and Courbet, Soutine developed an individual style more concerned with shape, color, and texture than representation, which served as a bridge between more traditional approaches and the developing form of Abstract Expressionism.
