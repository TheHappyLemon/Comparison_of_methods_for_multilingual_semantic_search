Eastern Gulf of Finland National Park (Finnish: Itäisen Suomenlahden kansallispuisto, Swedish: Östra Finska vikens nationalpark) is a national park in the Kymenlaakso region in Finland. It was established in 1982 and covers 6.7 square kilometres (2.6 sq mi) on land. The park consist only of small (under 1 km2) islands and islets, some of which grow forest, mostly pine trees. Most of the islands are treeless rocks with sheer shores. Their sheerness is due to the rapakivi granite splitting in a sharply cubical manner. The national park is known for its aquatic bird fauna. The most common aquatic birds are the goosander and tufted duck. Other birds, including the razorbill and black guillemot, nest on the park's protected islands.
