.gq is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Equatorial Guinea. Freenom relaunched the TLD on October 1, 2014, and domains became available for free on January 1, 2015. Following Freenom's lawsuit with Meta and its settlement in 2024, it is unclear who will take up ownership of the domain, as the company announced it would be exiting the domain business. The .gq registry allows the creation of emoji domain names.
