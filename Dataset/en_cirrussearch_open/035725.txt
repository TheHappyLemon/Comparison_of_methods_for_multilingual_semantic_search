Josaphat Kuntsevych, OSBM (c. 1580 – 12 November 1623) was a Basilian monk and archeparch of the Ruthenian Uniate Church who on 12 November 1623 was killed by an angry mob in Vitebsk, in the eastern peripheries of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He remains one of the best-known victims of anti-Catholic violence related to implementing the Union of Brest,: 57  and has been declared a martyr and saint of the Catholic Church. His death reflects the conflict between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches that had intensified after several members of the hierarchy of the Ruthenian Orthodox Church (Kiev Metropolitanate) rejected the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and instead entered communion with the Holy See under the terms laid down by the Council of Florence in the 1596 Union of Brest.
