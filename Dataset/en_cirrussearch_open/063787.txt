The House of Soviets (Russian: Дом Советов, romanized: Dom Sovetov) was an unfinished building in the center of the city of Kaliningrad in the Kaliningrad Oblast, an exclave of Russia. Residents of the city often referred to it as the "buried robot" because its appearance resembled the head of a giant robot buried in the ground up to the shoulders. Intended as the central administration building of the oblast, it was built on the original site of the 13th century Königsberg Castle. Construction of the building was never completed, and the building laid empty throughout its existence. Demolition of the structure began in 2023.
