Filipe Luís Kasmirski (born 9 August 1985), known as Filipe Luís, is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a left back. He is the current head coach of Flamengo U17. A player of tireless approach also known for his tactical awareness, he spent most of his early professional career in Spain, beginning at Deportivo where he spent four seasons. In 2010 he joined Atlético Madrid, and won four trophies including the La Liga championship in 2014. He signed with Chelsea in July of that year for £15.8 million, helping them to both the Premier League and the League Cup, but lack of game time in London saw him return to Atlético a year later, winning the Europa League and Super Cup in his second spell (both in 2018). He then joined Brazilian giants Flamengo as a free agent, where he won a number of honours including the Campeonato Brasilero in 2019, 2020, and the Copa Libertadores in 2019, and 2022. Filipe Luís made his debut for Brazil in 2009 and went on to earn over 40 caps, representing the nation at the 2013 Confederations Cup, three Copas América and the 2018 World Cup, winning the Confederations Cup as well as the 2019 Copa América. On the 30th November 2023 Filipe Luís announced his retirement from professional football.
