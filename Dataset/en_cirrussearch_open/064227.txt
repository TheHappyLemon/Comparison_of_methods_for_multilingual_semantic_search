The 2023 World Athletics Road Running Championships took place in Riga, Latvia, on 1 October 2023. As the inaugural World Athletics Road Running Championships, they included the World Athletics Half Marathon Championships, which were last held in 2020. A flat, single-lap marathon course in the Baltics' largest city. All courses were traffic-free. The championships held races for the half marathon, 5K, and mile distances, and also included mass-participation events for the same. This was the first time when any recreational runner who was ready for a challenge could register for any of the official mass races of the World Championships in Riga and earn a unique medal from the World Athletics Road Running Championships.
