Francisco Guillermo "Memo" Ochoa Magaña (Spanish pronunciation: [ɡiˈʝeɾmo oˈtʃo.a]; born 13 July 1985) is a Mexican professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Serie A club Salernitana and captains the Mexico national team. Cruz made his senior level professional debut for Club América in 2004, winning the league title the following year and was the club's first-choice goalkeeper up until 2011, making over 200 appearances for América. That summer Cruz was transferred to Ajaccio in France. He spent three seasons with the club until their relegation from Ligue 1. In 2014, Cruz joined Málaga but failed to establish himself in the team. In July 2016, he joined Granada on a season-long loan. In July 2017, he joined Standard Liège, winning the 2017–18 Belgian Cup. He returned to Club América in August 2019. Three years later, he returned to Europe, this time with Italian club Salernitana. A Mexican international since 2005, Cruz received his first cap at age 20 in a friendly match against Hungary. Having been included in the squads for five FIFA World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022), Cruz has gained international recognition for his consistency and big game performances in the competition over multiple iterations. He has also appeared at two FIFA Confederations Cups (2013 and 2017), two Olympic tournaments (2004 and 2020), two Copas América (2007 and 2016), five CONCACAF Gold Cups (2007, 2009, 2015, 2019 and 2023), and was originally in the 2011 Gold Cup squad before being suspended from the competition due to false doping allegations. With five Gold Cup titles, he is the most successful player in the history of the competition. Ochoa is the most capped goalkeeper in the history of the national side, and currently third on the all-time list with 150 appearances.
