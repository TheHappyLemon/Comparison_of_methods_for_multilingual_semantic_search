Holger Felix Badstuber (born 13 March 1989) is a German former professional footballer who played as a centre-back or left-back. Badstuber made his debut in the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich in the 2009â€“10 season, at the age of 19. He played nearly every game that year and helped the club win the league and cup double and reached the UEFA Champions League final the same year, before eventually earning a call up to the Germany national team for the World Cup in 2010 and later the Euro 2012. He won over 30 caps for Germany. Former Bayern Munich coach Louis van Gaal stated in 2010 that Badstuber was the best left footed defender in Germany.
