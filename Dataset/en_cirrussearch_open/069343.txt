Boric initially gained political prominence as a student leader during his time studying law at the University of Chile, being elected as president of the influential student federation during the student protests in 2011. This earned him a place in the 100 young leaders of Chile, published by El Sábado magazine in 2012. He first ran for office as an independent candidate in 2013 and later as part of the Broad Front coalition in 2017. In 2018, Boric founded the Social Convergence party, one of the parties that constitute the Broad Front and later Approve Dignity. During the 2019 civil unrest, Boric played a pivotal role in negotiating the agreement that led to the October 2020 constitutional referendum. In December 2021, he secured the country's presidency by defeating José Antonio Kast in the second round of the presidential election, receiving 55.9% of the votes. Following his election, Boric became the youngest president in Chilean history and is currently the seventh youngest serving state leader in the world.
