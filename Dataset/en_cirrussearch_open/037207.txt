Isocrotonic acid (also known as quartenylic acid; formally named (Z)-2-butenoic acid) is the cis isomer of crotonic acid. It is an oil, possessing an odor similar to that of brown sugar. At its boiling point of 171.9 °C, it converts into crotonic acid. The compound can be prepared from 1,3‑dibromo-2‑butanone via the Favorskii rearrangement.
