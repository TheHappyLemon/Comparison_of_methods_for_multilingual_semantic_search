Fantômas contre Scotland Yard (French pronunciation: [fɑ̃tomas kɔ̃tʁ skɔtland jaʁd], "Fantomas Against Scotland Yard") is the final installment of a trilogy of films starring Jean Marais as the arch villain Fantômas opposite Louis de Funès as the earnest but outclassed commissaire Juve and the journalist Fandor, also played by Marais. The trilogy was France's humorous answer, starting in 1964, to the James Bond phenomenon that swept the world at around the same time. The Fantômas films became extremely successful in Europe and USSR, and found success even in the United States and Japan where fan websites exist to this day.
