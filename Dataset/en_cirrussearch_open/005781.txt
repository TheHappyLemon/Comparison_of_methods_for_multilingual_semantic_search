Neumayer Station or Neumayer Station II was a permanent German Antarctic research base on Atka Bay. It opened in 1992, replacing the old Georg von Neumayer Station. On February 20, 2009, it was handed over to South Africa and replaced by the new permanent research base Neumayer Station III. At the time, the station was moving with the shelf ice at about 200 meters per year towards the open sea. The South African National Antarctic Programme dismantled the station in 2009 and built a new Emergency Base (E-Base) at the same location.
