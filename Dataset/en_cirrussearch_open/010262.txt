Imperial College London (commonly Imperial or legally Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine) is a public research university in London, England. Its history began with Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria, who developed his vision for a cultural area that included the Royal Albert Hall, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum and several royal colleges. In 1907, Imperial College London was established by royal charter unifying the Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines and the City and Guilds of London Institute. In 1988, the Imperial College School of Medicine was formed by merging with St Mary's Hospital Medical School. In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II opened the Imperial College Business School. Imperial College London focuses on science, engineering, medicine and business, with an entrepreneurial culture. The main campus is in South Kensington where most teaching and research takes place. A second campus in White City provides a platform for innovation. Facilities also include teaching hospitals throughout London that form an academic health science centre. The college was previously a member of the University of London and became an independent university in 2007. Imperial has a more international community, with around 60% of students from outside the UK and 140 countries represented on campus.
