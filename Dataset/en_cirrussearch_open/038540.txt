The dinar (/dɪˈnɑːr/) is the name of the principal currency unit in several countries near the Mediterranean Sea, with a more widespread historical use. The English word "dinar" is the transliteration of the Arabic دينار (dīnār), which was borrowed via the Syriac dīnarā, itself from the Latin dēnārius. The modern gold dinar is a projected bullion gold coin, and as of 2019[update] is not issued as an official currency by any state.
