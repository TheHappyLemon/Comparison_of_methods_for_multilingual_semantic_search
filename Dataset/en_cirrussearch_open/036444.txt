Jüri Ratas (Estonian pronunciation: [ˈjy.ri ˈrɑ.tɑs]; born 2 July 1978) is an Estonian politician who served as the prime minister of Estonia from 2016 to 2021 and as the leader of the Centre Party from 2016 to 2023, and the mayor of Tallinn from 2005 to 2007. Ratas was a member of the Centre Party until switching to Isamaa in 2024. As the prime minister Ratas led two cabinets his first cabinet was in office from 2016 to 2019 and second from 2019 to 2021. His second cabinet was notable for its share of public scandals, highest number of resignations of ministers in Estonian history and the number of public apologies from Ratas, mostly connected to the activities and offensive public statements of the smaller coalition partner nationalist and right-wing populist EKRE party. Among others they called Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin non-educated sales girl and Joe Biden a corrupt character forcing Ratas to apologize on their behalf. His tenure also saw the national budget of Estonia moving to deficit after years of being in surplus.
