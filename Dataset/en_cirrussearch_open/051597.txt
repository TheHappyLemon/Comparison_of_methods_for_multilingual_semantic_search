Vaygach Island (Russian: Вайга́ч, romanized: Vajgač) is an island in the Arctic Sea between the Pechora Sea and the Kara Sea. Vaygach Island is separated from the Yugorsky Peninsula in the mainland by the Yugorsky Strait and from Novaya Zemlya by the Kara Strait. The island is a part of Nenets Autonomous Okrug of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. Area: 3,383 square kilometres (1,306 sq mi) Length: ~ 100 kilometres (62 mi) Width: up to 45 kilometres (28 mi) Average temperatures: −20 °C (−4 °F) (February), 5 °C (41 °F) (June) Highest point: 170 metres (560 ft) Vaygach Island is mainly formed of argillaceous slates, sandstone, and limestone. There are many rivers about 20–40 kilometres (12–25 mi) in length, swamps, and small lakes on the island. For the most part it consists of tundra. Slight rocky ridges run generally along its length, and the coast has low cliffs in places. The island consists mostly of limestone, and its elevation above the sea is geologically recent. Raised beaches are frequent. The rocks are heavily scored by ice, but this was probably marine ice, not that of glaciers. The only settlement on the island is Varnek.
