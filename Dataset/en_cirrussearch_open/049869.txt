Soyuz MS-13, also designated ISS flight 59S, was a crewed Soyuz mission launched on 20 July 2019 – the 50th anniversary of the first Moon landing – carrying three members of the Expedition 60 crew to the International Space Station: a Russian commander, an American and a European flight engineer. Soyuz MS-13 was the 142nd flight of a Soyuz spacecraft. It was at one point the last Soyuz flight contracted by NASA in the expectation that subsequent astronaut transport would be provided by the Commercial Crew Program, but in early 2019 NASA sought to purchase two additional Soyuz seats to provide greater certainty given delays in that program.
