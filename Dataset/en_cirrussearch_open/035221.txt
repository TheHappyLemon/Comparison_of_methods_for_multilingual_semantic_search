Elaeocarpus bojeri, locally known as a bois dentelle ('lace wood' in French), descriptive of its delicate white flowers) is a species of flowering plant in the Elaeocarpaceae family. The species was once only found close to an Indian temple at Grand Bassin in Mauritius, where fewer than ten individuals were known to grow in the 1990s.
