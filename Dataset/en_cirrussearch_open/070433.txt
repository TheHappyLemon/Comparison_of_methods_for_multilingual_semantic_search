The Czech Wikipedia (Czech: Česká Wikipedie) is the Czech language edition of Wikipedia. This Wikipedia contains 543,547 articles, 2,498 active users, and 32 administrators. It was created on May 3, 2002. However, at that time, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki software. The three pages the Czech version had at the time were lost during the switch to MediaWiki. The oldest currently available edit is from when the Main Page was recopied on November 14, 2002. The user interface was localized and the first actual articles were written at the turn of 2002/2003 by a Czech editor of the Esperanto Wikipedia. Czech Wikipedia reached 1,000 articles, many about Esperanto topics, on October 20, 2003. An April 2004 report noted that it had 180 registered users at that time. In June 2005, the Czech Wikipedia reached 10,000 articles and it reached 20,000 in December of the same year. The Main Page was re-designed with more details after reaching this milestone. By November 2006, it exceeded 30,000 articles, and became the 21st language version to exceed 100,000 articles in June 2008. As of April 10, 2015 there are more than 319,100 articles, 29 administrators, almost 293,000 registered users, and dozens of very active contributors. In December 2009, contributors to the Czech Wikipedia held a conference in Prague. In 2008, the Czech NGO Wikimedia Česká republika (Wikimedia Czech Republic) was founded to support the Czech Wikipedia by organizing events, helping communication with authors of free content, and promoting the Czech Wikipedia to the public. On March 21, 2019, Czech Wikipedia was temporarily shut down to protest against the articles 11 and 13. The decision was announced three days in advance in March 18. On February 10, 2021, an article by the Czech weekly magazine Respekt revealed how the Wikipedia combatted ongoing misinformation and source manipulation on their coverage of the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, by blocking disruptive editors and reverting dubious content over months of back and forth. The Wikipedia reached half a million articles in the afternoon of March 16, 2022. The statistics at this time also revealed there were 2,500 active editors and 34 administrators, 70 articles were being created per day on average, and the most actively edited article was the one on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
