Wiki Loves Earth (WLE) is an annual international photographic competition held throughout May and June, organised worldwide by the Wikipedia community members with the help of local Wikimedia affiliates across the globe. Participants take pictures of local natural heritage and scenic landscape in their countries and upload them to Wikimedia Commons. The aim of the event is to highlight the conservation areas of the participating countries with the goal to encourage people to capture pictures of these sights and to put them under a free license which can then be re-used not only on Wikipedia but everywhere by everyone. The first Wiki Loves Earth competition was held in 2013 in Ukraine, and the contest became international in 2014. In 2019, 37 countries participated in the contest. In 2020, the international contest was extended into July in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. As of late June, 35 countries have declared their participation in the 2021 contest edition, with more than 63,000 photos uploaded to date.
