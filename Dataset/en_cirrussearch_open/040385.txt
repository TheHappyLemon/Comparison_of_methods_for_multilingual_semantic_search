The Faroe Islands Premier League (also known as Betri deildin menn for sponsorship reasons) is the top level of football in the Faroe Islands. It was founded in 1942 as Meistaradeildin, and it is played in current format since 2005, when Premier League replaced 1. deild as the country's top football division. The league is organised by the Faroe Islands Football Association. It is contested by 10 clubs. At the end of every season, two teams are relegated and two promoted from 1. deild. All teams in the league have semi-professional status, though some clubs are able to sign players and staff on a full-time basis. As of February 2024, the Faroe Islands Premier League is ranked 38th out of 55 leagues in the UEFA coefficient.
