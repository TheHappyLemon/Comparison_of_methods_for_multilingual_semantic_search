I (И и; italics: И и or И и; italics: И и) is a letter used in almost all Cyrillic alphabets with the exception of Belarusian. It commonly represents either the close front unrounded vowel /i/ (e.g., in Russian), like the pronunciation of ⟨i⟩ in "machine", or the near-close near-front unrounded vowel /ɪ/, (e.g., in Ukrainian), like the pronunciation of ⟨i⟩ in "bin".
