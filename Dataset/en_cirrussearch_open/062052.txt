Gardabani (Georgian: გარდაბანი) is a city of 11,650 residents (2021) in the southern Georgian region of Kvemo Kartli and is the administrative centre of the Gardabani Municipality. It is located 34 kilometres (21 mi) southeast of capital Tbilisi and 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Rustavi in the Kvemo Kartli Plain at an elevation of 300 metres (980 ft) above sea level. Until 1947 Gardabani was known as Karayazi (Azerbaijani: Qarayazı) and the city status was granted in 1969, after a thermal power plant was built for Tbilisi in the 1960s causing rapid growth. Since then more plower plants have been built and the city nowadays supplies almost all thermally generated electricity in the country.
