Software quality control is the set of procedures used by organizations to ensure that a software product will meet its quality goals at the best value to the customer, and to continually improve the organizationâ€™s ability to produce software products in the future. Software quality control refers to specified functional requirements as well as non-functional requirements such as supportability, performance and usability. It also refers to the ability for software to perform well in unforeseeable scenarios and to keep a relatively low defect rate. These specified procedures and outlined requirements lead to the idea of Verification and Validation and software testing. It is distinct from software quality assurance which encompasses processes and standards for ongoing maintenance of high quality of products, e.g. software deliverables, documentation and processes - avoiding defects. Whereas software quality control is a validation of artifacts compliance against established criteria - finding defects.
