"Debout Congolais" (Kongo: Telama besi Kongo; "Arise, Congolese") is the national anthem of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was originally adopted in 1960 upon independence from Belgium but was replaced by "La Zaïroise" when the Congo changed its name to Zaire in 1971. It was finally reinstated when the Congo was reorganised in 1997. The lyrics were written by historian and professor Joseph Lutumba, and the music was composed by Jesuit father Simon-Pierre Boka di Mpasi Londi [fr], who also wrote and composed "La Zaïroise".
