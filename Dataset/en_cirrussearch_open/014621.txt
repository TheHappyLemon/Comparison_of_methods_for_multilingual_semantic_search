William Michael Schuester, often referred to as Mr. Schue, is a fictional teacher character and one of the two main protagonists from the Fox musical comedy-drama series Glee, alongside his student Rachel Berry. He appeared in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Will was portrayed by Matthew Morrison, and was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan. He is a Spanish teacher at the fictional William McKinley High School and the director of the show's titular glee club in Lima Ohio, where the show is set. He ultimately becomes the school's principal. His storylines have seen him revive the school's failing glee club, leave his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), win the love of school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), and marry her. Morrison was cast as Will after Murphy spent three months observing actors on Broadway. Several musical performances featuring him have been released as singles, available for digital download, and also appear on the soundtrack albums Glee: The Music, Volume 1 and Glee: The Music, Volume 2, among others. Morrison was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor â€“ Television Series Musical or Comedy at the 2010 Golden Globe Awards for his performance in the role. The character initially received some negative reviews from critics, deemed "a little drab" by Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times. However, as the series progressed, Morrison attracted praise for his performance, with critics also commenting positively on the development of the romantic relationship between Will and Emma and the negative impact of his relationship with Finn.
