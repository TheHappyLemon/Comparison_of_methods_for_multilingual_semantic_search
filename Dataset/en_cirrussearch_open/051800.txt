Grodno Region or Hrodna Region, also known as Grodno Oblast or Hrodna Voblasts (Belarusian: Гродзенская вобласць, romanized: Hrodzienskaja voblasć; Russian: Гродненская область, romanized: Grodnenskaya oblast; Polish: Obwód Grodzieński), is one of the regions of Belarus. Its administrative center, Grodno, is the largest city in the region. Located in western Belarus, it lies on the Neman River. The region borders Minsk Region to the east, Brest Region to the south, Poland (Podlaskie Voivodeship) to the west and Vitebsk Region and Lithuania (Alytus and Vilnius counties) to the north. Grodno's existence is attested to from 1127. Two castles dating from the 14th to 18th centuries are located here on the steep right bank of the Nemen. One of the city's surviving masterpieces is the 12th century Orthodox Church of St Boris & St Gleb (Kalozhskaya Church), which is the second oldest in Belarus.
