.me is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Montenegro. The .me registry is operated by doMEn, which won a contract to do so after a bid process conducted by the government of Montenegro and was launched through various accredited registrars around the world. Google treats .me as a generic top-level domain (gTLD) because "users and website owners frequently see [the domain] as being more generic than country-targeted."
