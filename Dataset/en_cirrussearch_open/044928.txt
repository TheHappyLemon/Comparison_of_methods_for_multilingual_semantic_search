The Canadian Grand Prix (French: Grand Prix du Canada) is an annual motor racing event held since 1961. It has been part of the Formula One World Championship since 1967. It was first staged at Mosport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario, as a sports car event, before alternating between Mosport and Circuit Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, after Formula One took over the event. After 1971, safety concerns led to the Grand Prix moving permanently to Mosport. In 1978, after similar safety concerns with Mosport, the Canadian Grand Prix moved to its current home at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on Notre Dame Island in Montreal, Quebec. In 2005, the Canadian Grand Prix was the most watched Formula One Grand Prix in the world. The race was also the third most watched sporting event worldwide, behind the first place Super Bowl XXXIX and that yearâ€™s UEFA Champions League Final. The 2020 and 2021 events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After the cancellation of 2021 Canadian Grand Prix, the contract was extended to 2031.
