Ana Brnabić (Serbian Cyrillic: Ана Брнабић, pronounced [âna bř̩nabitɕ]; born 28 September 1975) is a Serbian politician serving as president of the National Assembly of Serbia since 2024. A member of the Serbian Progressive Party, she previously served as prime minister of Serbia from 2017 to 2024. She is the first woman, first openly gay, and longest-serving person to hold the office. She entered government as the minister of public administration and local self-government from 11 August 2016 until 29 June 2017, under prime minister Aleksandar Vučić and acting prime minister Ivica Dačić. In this role, Brnabić initiated reforms of central government services in Serbia. After he was inaugurated as the president of Serbia on 31 May 2017, Vučić proposed Brnabić as his successor in June 2017. Brnabić and her cabinet were voted into office on 29 June 2017 by a majority of 157 out of 250 members of the National Assembly of Serbia. Elected as a non-partisan politician, she joined the ruling Serbian Progressive Party in 2019, and was subsequently elected as vice president in 2021. The National Assembly re-elected her into office after the 2020 and 2022 elections. She was elected president of the National Assembly after the 2023 election. In 2019, Brnabić was ranked by Forbes magazine as the 88th most powerful woman in the world and as the 19th most powerful female political and policy leader. Some observers believe that she had no political power in line with the constitutional role of chief of the executive, arguing instead that Vučić wielded power in his capacity as the president.
