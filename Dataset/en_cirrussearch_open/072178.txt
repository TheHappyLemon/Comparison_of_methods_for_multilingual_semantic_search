Russia's Elena Dementieva defeated compatriot Dinara Safina in the final, 3–6, 7–5, 6–3 to win the gold medal in Women's Singles tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the bronze medal match, Russia's Vera Zvonareva defeated China's Li Na 6–0, 7–5. This was the first Olympic medal sweep in tennis since 1908, when three British women won medals in the outdoor women's singles tournament. It was the fifth podium sweep in tennis in Olympic history, all previous sweeps were by British athletes. It was Russia's first victory in the women's singles. Dementieva became the third woman to win multiple Olympic singles medals, following Steffi Graf (1988 and 1992) and Arantxa Sánchez Vicario (1992 and 1996), and the first to do so in non-consecutive Games. The tournament was held from August 10 to August 17 at the National Tennis Center in Beijing, China. The DecoTurf surface made the event a hardcourt tournament. There were 64 competitors from 33 nations. Justine Henin was the reigning gold medalist from 2004, but she retired from the sport earlier that year.
