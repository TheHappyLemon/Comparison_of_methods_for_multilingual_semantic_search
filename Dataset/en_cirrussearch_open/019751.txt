The 2013 Canadian Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada 2013) was a Formula One motor race that took place on 9 June 2013 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The race was the seventh round of the 2013 season, and marked the 50th running of the Canadian Grand Prix. After taking pole position, Sebastian Vettel took his and Red Bull's first victory at the Canadian Grand Prix, just over 14 seconds ahead of second-placed Fernando Alonso. The event was marred by the death of track marshal Mark Robinson, who was run over by a recovery vehicle. The accident happened while marshals were removing the Sauber of Esteban Guti√©rrez after the Mexican had spun off during the closing stages of the race. Robinson died later in hospital, and became the first trackside death in Formula One since that of marshal Graham Beveridge at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix.[citation needed]
