The school was founded in 1994 by the Stockholm School of Economics with the support of the Swedish government, and the Latvian Ministry of Education on behalf of Latvia. Since 2010 SSE Riga is owned by a foundation established by the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE), the University of Latvia (LU) and the SSE Riga Alumni Association.

Together with its mother school, the Stockholm School of Economics, it has been consistently ranked as the top business school in Latvia and among the best ones in Europe. SSE Riga employs variety of teaching methods, including group work, summer internships and case studies, and has exchange programs with many leading universities and business schools in Europe.
