Biutiful is a 2010 psychological drama film directed, produced and co-written by Alejandro González Iñárritu, and starring Javier Bardem. The project marks Iñárritu's first film in his native Spanish language since his debut feature Amores perros (2000). Alfonso Cuarón and Guillermo del Toro (who make up the "Three Amigos" with González Iñárritu in the film industry) serve as associate producers. The film follows Uxbal, a criminal and father who becomes diagnosed with prostate cancer and seeks to settle various things around his life before he dies. The title is in reference to the phonetic spelling in Spanish of the English word beautiful. Biutiful premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, and was released theatrically by Videocine in Mexico and United International Pictures in Spain on 22 October 2010 and 3 December, respectively. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and was a box-office bomb grossing $24.7 million worldwide on a budget of $35 million. It was nominated for two Academy Awards in 2011: Best Foreign Language and Best Actor for Bardem; his nomination was the first entirely Spanish-language performance to be nominated for the award. Bardem also received the Best Actor Award at Cannes for his work on the film.
