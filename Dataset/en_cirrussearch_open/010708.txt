Free content, libre content, libre information, or free information is any kind of functional work, work of art, or other creative content that meets the definition of a free cultural work, meaning "works or expressions which can be freely studied, applied, copied and/or modified, by anyone, for any purpose." Free content encompasses all works in the public domain and also those copyrighted works whose licenses honor and uphold the definition of free cultural work. In most countries, the Berne Convention grants copyright holders monopolistic control over their creations by default, therefore, copyrighted content must be explicitly declared free. This is usually accomplished by referencing or including licensing statements from within the work.
