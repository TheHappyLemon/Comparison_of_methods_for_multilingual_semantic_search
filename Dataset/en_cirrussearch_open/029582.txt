"Disillusion" is a ballad by the pop group ABBA, on their first album Ring Ring (1973). It is notable as the only song ABBA recorded and released on a studio album to have a songwriting credit from Agnetha Fältskog. She was a songwriter as well as a singer, and had dabbled in that in her pre-ABBA career. She wrote the music, with lyrics added by fellow ABBA member Björn Ulvaeus.
