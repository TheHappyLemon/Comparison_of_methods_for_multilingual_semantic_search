Jennifer's Body is a 2009 American comedy horror film written by Diablo Cody and directed by Karyn Kusama. Starring Megan Fox in the titular role, and Amanda Seyfried, alongside Johnny Simmons, J. K. Simmons, Amy Sedaris, and Adam Brody in supporting roles, the film follows a high school student, demonically possessed following a sacrifice, who kills her male classmates and devours their flesh in order to survive, with her childhood friend striving to end her killing spree. Working with Cody again following their collaborative efforts on Juno, Jason Reitman stated he and his producers "want to make unusual films". Cody said she wanted the film to speak to female empowerment and explore the complex relationships between best friends. As a tie-in to the film, Boom! Studios produced a Jennifer's Body graphic novel, released in August 2009. Jennifer's Body premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2009, and was theatrically released in the United States and Canada on September 18, 2009. The film had a lackluster performance at the box office, grossing $31.6 million against a budget of $16 million and received mixed reviews from critics, with its dialogue, emotional resonance and performances being praised, while the narrative and uneven tone were criticized. In the wake of the #MeToo Movement, it has been described as a feminist cult classic.
