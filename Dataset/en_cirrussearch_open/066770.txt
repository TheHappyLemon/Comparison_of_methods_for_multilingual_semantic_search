The Ukrainian Air Force (Ukrainian: Повітряні сили Збройних сил України, romanized: Povitriyani syly Zbroiynyh syl Ukraiyini, PS ZSU) is the air force of Ukraine and one of the seven branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Its current form was created in 2004 by merging the Ukrainian Air Defence Forces into the Air Force. When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, many aircraft were left in Ukrainian territory. After Ukrainian independence in 1991, the air force suffered from chronic under-investment, leading to the bulk of its inventory becoming mothballed or otherwise inoperable. However its domestic defense industry Ukroboronprom and its Antonov subsidiary are able to maintain its older aircraft. The Ukrainian Air Force participated in the war in Donbas. Following the 2014 ceasefire, the air force was suspended from carrying out missions in the areas of Donbas. Since February 2022, the Air Force has been engaged in constant combat operations in the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The main inventory of the air force still consists of Soviet-made aircraft, but pilots are training to fly the F-16.
