The UEFA coaching licences are documents testifying credentials of coaches among members of UEFA. UEFA, the governing body for football in Europe, mandates several coaching licences for professional managers, each valid for coaching at a certain level for all members of the organization. These include the UEFA Pro Licence, the UEFA A Licence, and the UEFA B Licence. They are issued by each UEFA member state's football federation and are valid for three years.
