Pope Alexander I (Greek: Αλέξανδρος, c. 75–80 AD – c. 115) was the bishop of Rome from c. 107 to his death c. 115. The Holy See's Annuario Pontificio (2012) identifies him as a Roman who served from 108 or 109 to 116 or 119. Some believe he suffered martyrdom under the Roman emperor Trajan or Hadrian.
