.pa is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Panama. It was first registered in 1994-05-25. It is administered by NIC Panamá, which is run by the Universidad Tecnologica de Panama. Because "PA" is also the postal code for the U.S. state of Pennsylvania and the Brazilian state of Pará, it has had occasional use under that meaning, but this has not become widespread.[citation needed]
