Dalarna (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈdɑ̂ːlaɳa] ) is a landskap (historical province) in central Sweden. English exonyms for it are Dalecarlia (US: /ˌdɑːləˈkɑːrliə/) and the Dales. Dalarna adjoins Härjedalen, Hälsingland, Gästrikland, Västmanland and Värmland. It is also bordered by Norway in the west. The province's borders mostly coincide with the modern administrative Dalarna County (län). The word "Dalarna" means "the dales" (valleys). The area is a holiday destination for Swedes from the south, who often travel there in the summer, drawn by its fishing lakes, campgrounds, and forests.[citation needed] Some Swedes own or rent a second home in Dalarna, where they are likely to have a vegetable garden and apple trees.[citation needed] In mid-June, midsummer celebrations and dances are held in many of the small villages and in the larger cities. Dalarna is a region full of historical associations, and both its products and its people have strong local characteristics. In the western district Lima, some people in villages speak a traditional dialect, Dalecarlian, while in Älvdalen, they speak Elfdalian, a dialect which is very distinct from Swedish, Norwegian or Danish. Historically, the people of Dalecarlia – called Dalecarlians, or Dalesmen (dalkarlar, masar) and Daleswomen (kullor) – have been famous for their independent nature toward authority. The Old Norse form of the province name is Járnberaland, which means "the land of the iron carriers." Dalarna is roughly the size of the whole of Jutland (Denmark).
