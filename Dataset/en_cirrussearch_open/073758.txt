The Monte-Carlo Masters (also known as the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters for sponsorship reasons) is an annual tennis tournament for male professional players held in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, which borders on Monaco. It is played on clay courts at the Monte Carlo Country Club and is held in May. The tournament is part of the nine ATP Tour Masters 1000 events on the ATP Tour. Rafael Nadal has won the men's singles title a record eleven times. The event was founded in 1896 as the Monte-Carlo International. The following year the event officially became known as the Monte-Carlo Championships, also known as the Monte Carlo International Championships, which was a combined men's and women's tournament until 1982 when the women's championships ceased.
