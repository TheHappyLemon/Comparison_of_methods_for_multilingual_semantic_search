The Serbian Super League (Serbian: Супер лига Србије / Super liga Srbije), referred to as the Mozzart Bet SuperLiga (Serbian: Моцарт Бет СуперЛига, English: Mozzart Bet Super League) for sponsorship reasons, is a Serbian professional league for football clubs. At the top of the Serbian football league system, it is the country's primary football competition. It is usually contested by 16 clubs, but the 2020–21 season was contested by 20 clubs, because the Football Association of Serbia restructured the league due to the COVID-19 pandemic, operating a system of promotion and relegation with Serbian First League, the second tier in the Serbian football pyramid. The SuperLiga was formed during the summer of 2005 as the country's top football league competition in Serbia and Montenegro. Since summer 2006 after the secession of Montenegro from Serbia, the league only has had Serbian clubs. Serbian clubs used to compete in the Yugoslav First League. This competition was formed in 1923 and lasted until 2003. After the downfall of SFR Yugoslavia in 1991 a new Yugoslavia would be formed that would be named FR Yugoslavia with Montenegro and Serbia. They kept the name Yugoslavia until 2003 when the country changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro: this union lasted until 2006 when Montenegro gained independence and formed its own league, the Montenegrin First League. The current SuperLiga champions are Red Star Belgrade. UEFA currently ranks the league 13th in Europe of 55 leagues. The league was known as Meridian SuperLiga from 2005 until 2008. The league's official sponsor until 2015 was beer brand Jelen pivo, this resulted in the league's official name to be Jelen SuperLiga.
