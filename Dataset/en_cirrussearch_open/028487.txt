Dinamo National Olympic Stadium (Belarusian: Нацыянальны Алімпійскі стадыён Дынама, Nacyjanalny Alimpijski stadyjon Dynama, Belarusian pronunciation: [stadɨˈjɔn dɨˈnama]) is a multi-purpose stadium in Minsk, Belarus. It first opened in 1934 and has had several renovations over the years, reopening after the latest one in 2017. Earlier it was used mostly for football matches and was the home ground of Dinamo Minsk, FC Minsk and the Belarus national football team. Previously the stadium officially held 40,000, but because part of the upper stand had been abandoned in the mid-1990s for safety reasons, the actual capacity before renovations was 34,000. After renovation the capacity is only 22,246.
