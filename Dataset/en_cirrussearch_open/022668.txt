Laodicea on the Lycus (Greek: Λαοδίκεια πρὸς τοῦ Λύκου Laodikeia pros tou Lykou; Latin: Laodicea ad Lycum, also transliterated as Laodiceia or Laodikeia) (modern Turkish: Laodikeia) was a rich ancient city in Asia Minor, now Turkey, on the river Lycus (Çürüksu). It was located in the Hellenistic regions of Caria and Lydia, which later became the Roman Province of Phrygia Pacatiana. It is now near the modern city of Denizli. Since 2002, Pamukkale University has continued archaeological excavations, followed by intensive restoration work. In 2013 the archaeological site was inscribed in the Tentative List of World Heritage Sites in Turkey. It contained one of the Seven churches of Asia mentioned in the Book of Revelation.
