George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, KG (/ˈvɪlərz/ VIL-ərz; 20 August 1592 – 23 August 1628), was an English courtier, statesman, and patron of the arts. He was a favourite and self-described "lover" of King James VI and I. Buckingham remained at the height of royal favour for the first three years of the reign of James's son, King Charles I, until he was assassinated. Villiers was born in Brooksby, Leicestershire from a modest background. His ascent began notably in 1614 when, aged 21, he caught the attention of the king. Villiers' rise was facilitated by his physical beauty, charm, and talents such as dancing and fencing,[citation needed] which were nurtured by his mother Mary, a widow who aimed to see her son succeed at court. His achievements include being knighted and climbing the ranks of nobility, eventually becoming the Duke of Buckingham. He developed a close and controversial relationship with King James, leading to speculation about the nature of their bond. Villiers' influence extended beyond the king's favor; he played a significant role in political and military affairs, including the negotiation of royal marriages and leading military expeditions. His tenure as Lord High Admiral and de facto foreign minister, was marked by a series of failed military campaigns, such as the ill-fated expedition to Cádiz, which damaged his reputation and public image. Buckingham's assassination in 1628 by John Felton, a disgruntled army officer, highlighted the extent of his unpopularity among the public.
