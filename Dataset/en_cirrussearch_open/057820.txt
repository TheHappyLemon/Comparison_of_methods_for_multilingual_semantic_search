The Boss Baby: Family Business (known in other territories as The Boss Baby 2) is a 2021 American animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Universal Pictures. Loosely based on the 2010 picture book The Boss Baby and its 2016 sequel The Bossier Baby by Marla Frazee, it is the second installment in The Boss Baby franchise and the sequel to The Boss Baby (2017). The film was again directed by Tom McGrath from a screenplay by Michael McCullers, and a story by McGrath and McCullers. It stars the voices of James Marsden, Amy Sedaris, Ariana Greenblatt, Jeff Goldblum, and Eva Longoria, while Alec Baldwin, Jimmy Kimmel, and Lisa Kudrow reprise their roles from the first film. The plot follows the now-adult Templeton brothers who are brought back together after Tim's daughter Tina requests their help for Baby Corp to stop a professor from erasing childhoods worldwide. Plans for a Boss Baby sequel were announced in May 2017 with McGrath returning to direct. Animation began at DWA Glendale and some production assets were borrowed from Jellyfish Pictures, with voice acting being done remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 2, 2021, in traditional and select RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema and 4DX locations, by Universal Pictures; it also streamed on paid tiers of Peacock for 60 days. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed over $146 million worldwide against a budget of $82 million. A third Boss Baby film was announced to be in early development.
