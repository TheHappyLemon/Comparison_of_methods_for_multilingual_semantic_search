A man overboard rescue turn (or person overboard) is a shiphandling manoeuvre usually implemented immediately upon learning of a person having gone overboad into the sea. To bring a vessel closer to the person's location, implementations of the principles described are: the Anderson turn (or single turn), the quick turn (also known as the Q-turn or the figure eight turn), the Williamson turn, and the Scharnow turn. The choice of manoeuvre is dependent on several factors, including: Location of the casualty Whether the casualty is seen going overboard immediately or if their missing is delayed Whether the ship is using engines or using sails The space available for the vessel to steer The training of the crew involved. Ideally, in any man overboard scenario, the casualty should be approached with the vessel downwind of the persons position, with the vessel moving upwind. The man overboard rescue turn is often carried out as part of regular drills on Merchant ships as a requirement of the SOLAS Convention.
