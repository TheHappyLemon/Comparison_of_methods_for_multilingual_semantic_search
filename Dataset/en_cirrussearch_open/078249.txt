.dk is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Denmark. The supervision of the .dk top-level domain is handled exclusively by Punktum dk. Any new .dk domain name has to be applied for via an approved registrar. Then the domain name applicant can ask the registrar to manage their domain name or have it managed directly by the Punktum dk. Registrations of domain names with the characters æ, ø, å, ö, ä, ü, é, and ẞ are also allowed.
