A nonomino (or enneomino or 9-omino) is a polyomino of order 9; that is, a polygon in the plane made of 9 equal-sized squares connected edge to edge. The name of this type of figure is formed with the prefix non(a)-. When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, there are 1,285 different free nonominoes. When reflections are considered distinct, there are 2,500 one-sided nonominoes. When rotations are also considered distinct, there are 9,910 fixed nonominoes.
