The Moldova (German: Moldau) is a river in Romania, in the historical region of Moldavia. It is a right tributary of the river Siret. The river rises from the Obcina Feredeu Mountains of Bukovina in Suceava County and joins the Siret in Cotu Vameș, east of the city of Roman in Neamț County. The total length of the Moldova from its source to its confluence with the Siret is 213 km (132 mi). Its basin area is 4,299 km2 (1,660 sq mi). The river gave its name to the Principality of Moldavia, whose first capital, Târgul Moldovei (now Baia), is on the Moldova River. The etymology of the name is disputed.
