The 2024 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as UEFA Euro 2024 (stylised as UEFA EURO 2024) or simply Euro 2024, will be the 17th edition of the UEFA European Championship, the quadrennial international football championship organised by UEFA for the European men's national teams of its member associations. Germany will host the tournament, which is scheduled to take place from 14 June to 14 July 2024 and the winner will later compete in the 2025 CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions against the 2024 Copa América winner. 24 teams will compete, with Georgia as the only team making their first appearance in a UEFA European Championship finals tournament. It will be the third time that European Championship matches are played on German territory and the second time in reunified Germany, as the former West Germany hosted the tournament's 1988 edition, and four matches of the multi-national Euro 2020 were played in Munich. It will be the first time the competition is held in what was formerly East Germany with Leipzig as a host city, as well as the first time that a reunified Germany serves as a solo host nation. The tournament will return to its usual four-year cycle, after the 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Italy is the defending champion, having won the 2020 tournament after beating England on penalties in the final.
