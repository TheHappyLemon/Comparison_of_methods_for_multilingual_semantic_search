Nampalys Mendy (born 23 June 1992) is a professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Ligue 1 club Lens. Born in France, he represents Senegal at international level. Due to his small stature, simple distribution, and reliable style of play, Mendy has been compared to former French international, Claude Makélélé. Monaco club scout Didier Christophe, for example, referred to Mendy as a "carbon copy" of Makélélé. Mendy featured in Senegal's 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Final victory against Egypt.
