Airdrieonians Football Club is a Scottish professional football team in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, who are members of the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) and play in the Scottish Championship. They were formed in 2002 as Airdrie United Football Club following the liquidation of the original Airdrieonians club, formed in 1878. The club's official name was changed in 2013 with the approval of the Scottish Football Association to the traditional name of Airdrieonians. As with the previous club, this is often colloquially shortened to simply "Airdrie". The club have won three trophies in their short history – the Scottish Second Division in 2003–04 and the Challenge Cup in 2008–09 and 2023–24. Once described as "the luckiest team in the Scottish League", the club have benefited in league division placements due to other club's misfortunes on three occasions (2008, 2009 and 2012). However the club have lost six Scottish league play-off finals (2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2021 and 2022) and two semi-finals (2010 and 2017) in total, eventually offset by a Championship play-off final victory in 2023 against Hamilton Academical.
