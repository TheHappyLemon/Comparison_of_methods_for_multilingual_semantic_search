The Kingdom of Castile (/kæˈstiːl/; Spanish: Reino de Castilla: Latin: Regnum Castellae) was a polity in the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages. It traces its origins to the 9th-century County of Castile (Spanish: Condado de Castilla, Latin: Comitatus Castellæ), as an eastern frontier lordship of the Kingdom of Asturias. During the 10th century, the Castilian counts increased their autonomy, but it was not until 1065 that it was separated from León and became a kingdom in its own right. Between 1072 and 1157, it was again united with León, and after 1230, the union became permanent Throughout that period, the Castilian kings made extensive conquests in southern Iberia at the expense of the Islamic principalities. The Kingdoms of Castile and of León, with their southern acquisitions, came to be known collectively as the Crown of Castile, a term that also came to encompass overseas expansion.
