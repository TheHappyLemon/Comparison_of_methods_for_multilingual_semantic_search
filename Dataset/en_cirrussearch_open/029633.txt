Subway IP LLC, doing business as Subway (stylized in all caps), is an American multinational fast food restaurant franchise that specializes in submarine sandwiches (subs), wraps, salads, and drinks. Subway was founded by Fred DeLuca and financed by Peter Buck in 1965 as Pete's Super Submarines in Bridgeport, Connecticut. After several name changes in the beginning years, it was finally renamed Subway in 1972, and a franchise operation began in 1974 with a second restaurant in Wallingford, Connecticut. Since then it has expanded to become a global franchise. Subway offers an array of topping choices for the customer to include in their sandwich. The longtime Subway slogan, "Eat Fresh", is intended to indicate the fresh ingredients that are used in their sandwiches. It was the fastest-growing franchise in the world in 2015 and, as of September 2023, had over 37,000 locations in more than 100 countries and territories. More than half its locations (21,796 or 58.1%) are in the United States. It also is the largest single-brand restaurant chain, and the largest restaurant operator in the world. Its international headquarters is in Shelton, Connecticut, with a second headquarters in Miami, Florida.
