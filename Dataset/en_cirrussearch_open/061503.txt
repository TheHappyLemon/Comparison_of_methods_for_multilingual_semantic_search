A hromada (Ukrainian: територіальна громада, romanized: terytorialna hromada, lit. 'territorial community') is a basic unit of administrative division in Ukraine, similar to a municipality. It was established by the Government of Ukraine on 12 June 2020. Similar terms exist in Poland (gromada) and in Belarus (hramada). The literal translation of this term is "community", similar to the terms used in western European states, such as Germany (Gemeinde), France (commune), Italy (comune), and Portugal (freguesia), or in several English-speaking countries (township). A hromada is designated urban hromada if its administration is located in a city; settlement hromada if it is located in a settlement (selyshche), and rural hromada if it is located in a village (selo) or another rural settlement. Territories of hromadas (which, in turn, are divided into 7744 starosta okruhs (elderships)) form raions (districts) and several raions form oblasts (regions).
