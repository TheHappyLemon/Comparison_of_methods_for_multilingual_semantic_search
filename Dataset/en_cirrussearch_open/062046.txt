Carlos Alcaraz Garfia (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkarlos alkaˈɾaθ]; born 5 May 2003) is a Spanish professional tennis player. He has been ranked as high as world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), and is the current world No. 3. Alcaraz has won thirteen ATP Tour-level singles titles, including two major titles (at the 2022 US Open and 2023 Wimbledon Championships) and five Masters 1000 titles. Following his win at the 2022 US Open, Alcaraz became the youngest man and the first teenager in the Open Era to top the singles rankings, at 19 years, 4 months, and 6 days old. After turning professional in 2019 at the age of 16, Alcaraz won three titles on the ITF Men's World Tennis Tour and four on the ATP Challenger Tour. He broke into the top 100 in rankings in May 2021, and ended that year in the top 35 after reaching his first major quarterfinal at the US Open. In March 2022, Alcaraz won his first Masters 1000 title at the Miami Open at the age of 18, and then won his second at the Madrid Open where he defeated Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Alexander Zverev in succession. In late 2022, Alcaraz won his first major singles title at the US Open and finished the year as the youngest year-end No. 1 in ATP ranking history, later being named the Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year for his performance in the season. In 2023, Alcaraz claimed two additional Masters 1000 titles at Indian Wells and Madrid, and earned his second major title at Wimbledon defeating four-time defending champion Novak Djokovic, to become the first champion outside of the Big Four since Lleyton Hewitt in 2002.
