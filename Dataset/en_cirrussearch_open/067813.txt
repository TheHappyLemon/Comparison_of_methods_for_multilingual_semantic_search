The Curaçao national football team (Dutch: Curaçaos voetbalelftal; Papiamento: Selekshon di Futbòl Kòrsou) represents Curaçao in international football, and is controlled by the Curaçao Football Federation (Federashon Futbòl Kòrsou; FFK). Following a constitutional change that allowed its predecessor, the Colony of Curaçao and Dependencies to become a unified constituent country consisting of several island territories as the Netherlands Antilles and its dissolution in 2010, Curaçao has played under a new constitutional status as a separate constituent country since 2011. Both FIFA and CONCACAF recognize the Curaçao national team to be the direct and sole successor of the dependant Curaçao (1921–1958) and the Netherlands Antilles national football teams.
