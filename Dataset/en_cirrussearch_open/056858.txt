Classical electromagnetism or classical electrodynamics is a branch of theoretical physics that studies the interactions between electric charges and currents using an extension of the classical Newtonian model. It is, therefore, a classical field theory. The theory provides a description of electromagnetic phenomena whenever the relevant length scales and field strengths are large enough that quantum mechanical effects are negligible. For small distances and low field strengths, such interactions are better described by quantum electrodynamics which is a quantum field theory. Fundamental physical aspects of classical electrodynamics are presented in many textbooks. For the undergraduate level, textbooks like The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Electricity and Magnetism, and Introduction to Electrodynamics are considered as classic references and for the graduate level, textbooks like Classical Electricity and Magnetism, Classical Electrodynamics, and Course of Theoretical Physics are considered as classic references.
