Paul Emerson Carlyle Ince (/Éªns/; born 21 October 1967) is an English professional football manager and former player who was most recently manager of EFL Championship side Reading. A former midfielder, Ince played professionally from 1986 to 2007, starting his career with West Ham United and later representing Manchester United, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Swindon Town and Macclesfield Town in England, as well as Inter Milan in Italy. With a combined total of 271 league appearances for the two, Ince is one of the few players, especially in the Premier League era, to have represented both of arch rivals Liverpool and Manchester United. Ince spent the majority of his playing career at the highest level; after breaking through with his then-Second Division boyhood club West Ham United, he joined Manchester United in 1989 where he would win the Premier League twice, the FA Cup twice and the Football League Cup once during his six-year spell at Old Trafford. After falling out with manager Alex Ferguson, Ince was sold to Inter Milan of Serie A in 1995, where he was a runner-up in the 1997 UEFA Cup. After two years in Italy, Ince returned to the Premier League with Liverpool, later also representing Middlesbrough and Wolverhampton Wanderers in the top flight before beginning to move into coaching in the mid-2000s. After a spell as player-coach of Swindon Town, he retired from playing while player-manager of Macclesfield Town in 2007. He went on to manage Milton Keynes Dons (twice), Blackburn Rovers, Notts County and, after an almost-two-year break, Blackpool. He was capped 53 times by England, scoring two goals. As a player, he won numerous honours with Manchester United, and became the first black player to captain the England national team. His son Tom is also a footballer.
