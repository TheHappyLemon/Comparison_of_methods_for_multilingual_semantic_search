An Albino is a type of chess problem, "in which, at some point in the solution, a white Pawn on its starting square makes each of its four possible moves (forward one square, forward two squares, capture to the left, capture to the right)." When a Black pawn exhibits similar activity or a quadruple defense instead of "Albino" it is termed a "Pickaninny" (see: albino and pickaninny). The Albino is, "the four possible moves of a WP [white pawn] on its initial square (excluding squares a2 and h2)," and, the Pickaninny, "the four possible moves of a BP [black pawn] on its initial square (excluding squares a7 and h7)". The latter term was coined by Frank Janet by 1916. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
