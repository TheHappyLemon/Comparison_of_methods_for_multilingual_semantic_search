The Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex (also known as Olympic Stadium; Ukrainian: Національний спортивний комплекс "Олімпійський", romanized: Natsionalnyi sportyvnyi kompleks "Olimpiiskyi") is a multi-use sports and recreation facility in Kyiv, Ukraine, located on the slopes of the city's central Cherepanova Hora (Cherepanov Hill), Pecherskyi District. The Olympic National Sports Complex Stadium is the premier sports venue in Ukraine and the sixteenth largest such venue in Europe. Although it is often used by FC Dynamo Kyiv for football matches, it is technically not the football club's home stadium. Since May 2020, the stadium has also been used for the home matches of Shakhtar Donetsk due to the war in Donbas. The complex beside its stadium also features several other sports facilities and is designed to host the Olympic Games (the stadium hosted some football matches at the 1980 Summer Olympics). Following extensive renovation, including the construction of a new roof, the stadium was reopened on 9 October 2011 with a performance by Shakira, and had its international inauguration with a 3–3 friendly draw by Ukraine against Germany on 11 November 2011. It hosted the final of the UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final.
