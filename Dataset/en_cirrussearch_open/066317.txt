The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station (Ukrainian: ДніпроГЕС, romanized: DniproHES), also known as Dnipro Dam, in the city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, is the largest hydroelectric power station on the Dnieper river. It is the fifth step of the Dnieper cascade of hydroelectric stations that provides electric power for the Donets–Kryvyi Rih Industrial region. The Dnieper Reservoir stretches 129 kilometres (80 mi) upstream to near Dnipro city. The dam was built by the Soviet Union. DniproHES-1 was first built in 1927–1932. It was destroyed during World War II to make it harder for the advancing German forces to cross the river, and again further blown up in 1943, this time by retreating German troops. It was then rebuilt in 1944–1950. DniproHES-2 was built in 1969–1980 and modernized during the 2000s. The dam is an important crossing of the Dnieper. It has two shipping canals, one disued with three staircase locks and one single lock that allows vessels navigating the river bypassing the dam at its eastern end. A highway connecting the banks of the Dnieper crosses with a bridge over the shipping canals. The dam was hit by Russian missiles on 22 March 2024 and stopped working.
