Cavite City, officially the City of Cavite (Filipino: Lungsod ng Cavite, Spanish and Chavacano: Ciudad de Cavite), is a 2nd class component city in the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 100,674 people. The city was the capital of Cavite Province from its establishment in 1614 until 1954, when it was transferred to the newly created city of Trece Martires near the center of the province. It was started as the small port town of Cavite Puerto that prospered during the early Spanish colonial period, when it became the main seaport of Manila. It hosted the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade and the port was used for other heavy and larger sea-bound ships. Thereafter, San Roque and La Caridad, two formerly independent towns of Cavite province, were later added to form one municipality. The present larger Cavite City now includes the communities of San Antonio (including Ca√±acao and Sangley Point), the southern districts of Santa Cruz and Dalahican, and the outlying islands of the province, including the historic Corregidor Island.
