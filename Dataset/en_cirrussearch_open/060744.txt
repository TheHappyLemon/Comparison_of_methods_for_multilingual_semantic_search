The Colorado Rockies are an American professional baseball team based in Denver. The Rockies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West Division. The team plays its home baseball games at Coors Field, which is located in the Lower Downtown area of Denver. The club is owned by the Monfort brothers and managed by Bud Black. The Rockies began as an expansion team for the 1993 season and played their home games for their first two seasons at Mile High Stadium. Since 1995, they have played at Coors Field, which has earned a reputation as a hitter's park. The Rockies have qualified for the postseason five times, each time as a Wild Card winner. In 2007, the team earned its only NL pennant after winning 14 of their final 15 games in the regular season to secure a Wild Card position, capping the streak off with a 13-inning 9–8 victory against the San Diego Padres in the tiebreaker game affectionately known as "Game 163" by Rockies fans. The Rockies then proceeded to sweep the Philadelphia Phillies and Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLDS and NLCS and entered the 2007 World Series as winners of 21 of their last 22 games. However, they were swept by the American League (AL) champions Boston Red Sox in four games. As the Rockies were swept in their only World Series appearance, they are one of only two teams never to win a World Series game (the other being the Seattle Mariners, who have yet to make a World Series appearance). From 1993 to 2023, the Rockies have an overall record of 2,260–2,598 (.465 winning percentage). After the Denver Nuggets won the 2023 NBA Finals, the Rockies became the only one of Denver’s franchises in the five major North American professional sports leagues (MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL, & NHL) yet to win a championship.
