In linear algebra, an invertible complex square matrix U is unitary if its matrix inverse U−1 equals its conjugate transpose U*, that is, if U∗U=UU∗=I,{\displaystyle U^{*}U=UU^{*}=I,} where I is the identity matrix. In physics, especially in quantum mechanics, the conjugate transpose is referred to as the Hermitian adjoint of a matrix and is denoted by a dagger (†), so the equation above is written U†U=UU†=I.{\displaystyle U^{\dagger }U=UU^{\dagger }=I.} A complex matrix U is special unitary if it is unitary and its matrix determinant equals 1. For real numbers, the analogue of a unitary matrix is an orthogonal matrix. Unitary matrices have significant importance in quantum mechanics because they preserve norms, and thus, probability amplitudes.
