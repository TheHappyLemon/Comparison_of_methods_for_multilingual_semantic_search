Pip Ivan (Ukrainian: Піп Іван; Polish: Pop Iwan) is the third highest peak (after Hoverla and Brebeneskul) in the Chornohora (Czarnohora) range, with a height of 2022 meters (6,634 ft) above sea level. In the interwar period (1918–1939) the peak marked the Polish - Czechoslovak, from March 1939 Polish - Hungarian border and numerous skirmishes between OUN and Polish border troops took place in the area. On the peak (then in Polish called Pop Iwan), from 1936–1938 the Polish government built an astronomical and meteorological observatory, which was commonly called "Biały Słoń" ("White Elephant").
