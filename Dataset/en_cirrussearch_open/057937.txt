B-SAD is a Portuguese football club currently based in Almada, founded on 30 June 2018 as an independent entity. An offshoot of Clube de Futebol Os Belenenses, they played four seasons in the Primeira Liga, being relegated to the Liga Portugal 2 in 2022 and then to Liga 3 in 2023 - the third tier of Portuguese football. After a failed merger with Cova da Piedade in 2023, their Liga 3 license was revoked and B-SAD subsequently reformed and relocated from Lisbon to Almada to enroll and compete in the Setúbal district championships - the lowest tier of Portuguese football. Before changing their name, after the 2021–22 season, they were referred to as Belenenses SAD, or officially Os Belenenses – Sociedade Desportiva de Futebol, SAD.
