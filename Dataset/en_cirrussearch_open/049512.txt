The Spain women's national football team, officially known as the Spanish national football team (Spanish: Selección Española de Fútbol) has represented Spain in international women's football competitions since 1980. It is governed by the Royal Spanish Football Federation, the governing body for football in Spain. Spain is one of five national teams to have been crowned world champions, having qualified three times for the FIFA Women's World Cup and winning the title in 2023. They are one of only two countries, along with Germany, to have won both men's and women's World Cups. Together with their youth teams, Spain is the current world champion in all three female categories (U-17, U-20 and senior level), unprecedented in the women's game. At continental level, Spain won the first edition of the UEFA Women's Nations League in 2024, becoming the first nation to win both men's and women's competitions. They also have qualified four times for the UEFA Women's Championship, reaching the semifinals in 1997.
