The Pokljuka Plateau (pronounced [pɔˈkljuːka]) is a forested karst plateau at an elevation of around 1,100 to 1,400 metres (3,600 to 4,600 ft), located in the Julian Alps in northwestern Slovenia. The plateau is known for its forests, mountain pastures (Javornik, Lipanca, Uskovnica, Zajamniki, etc.), and winter sports facilities. It is also a common starting point for mountain hikers. The yearly Biathlon World Cup meets are held at the Pokljuka Biathlon Center, 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) west of the town of Bled (25 kilometres or 16 miles by car). Pokljuka is part of Triglav National Park. Administratively, it belongs to the municipalities of Bled, Bohinj, and Gorje. Many beech and fir trees were chopped down in the 18th century for the iron foundries in Bohinj. They have been naturally replaced mostly by spruce trees. Some swamps can also be found, which is not usual on such high plateaus.
