Ukraine first participated at the Olympic Games as an independent nation in 1994, and has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games since then. The first athlete who won the gold medal for the yellow-blues was Oksana Baiul. However for the first time the Ukrainian national flag and the Ukrainian state anthem sounded in 1992 when Oleg Kutscherenko from Luhansk Oblast won his gold medal in Barcelona as part of the so called "Unified Team". Previously, athletes of modern Ukraine mostly competed as part of the Russian Empire (1900â€“1912) and the Soviet Union from 1952 to 1988, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukrainian athletes were part of the Unified Team in 1992. Tatiana Gutsu became the best athlete of the Unified Team in 1992 from independent Ukraine. Independently, Ukraine has won a total of 120 medals at the Summer Games and 8 at the Winter Games, with gymnastics at summer and biathlon at winter as the nation's top medal-producing sports. The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine was created in 1990 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1993. Ukraine has won a total of 148 medals since it regained independence, with 38 of them gold, the second most amongst all post-Soviet states behind Russia.
