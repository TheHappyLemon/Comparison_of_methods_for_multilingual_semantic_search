Ellen May Gandy (born 15 August 1991), also known by her nickname Elly Gandy, is a British-born Australian former female butterfly swimmer. She represented Great Britain and England until 2012, and had almost all of her elite-level success under those flags. She represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics in the 200m butterfly swimming event, and was the 2011 World silver medalist at that distance. Following a disappointing 2012 Games, Gandy expressed an intention to swim for Australia, having lived and trained there since 2007, and served a period of ineligibility in order to do so. She represented Australia for the first time at a FINA World Cup event in Eindhoven in August 2013. She competed for Australia at the 2014 Commonwealth Games but failed to medal. Gandy did not qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics, effectively ending her elite swimming career. Under her new flag, Gandy broke the Australian and Commonwealth short-course 200m butterfly record. She remains the British long course record-holder in 100 and 200 metre butterfly, and 4 Ã— 100 metre medley.
