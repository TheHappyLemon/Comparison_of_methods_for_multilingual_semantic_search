Ludza Municipality (Latvian: Ludzas novads) is a municipality in Latgale, Latvia. The municipality was formed in 2009 by merging Briģi Parish, Cirma Parish, Isnauda Parish, Istra Parish, Nirza Parish, Ņukši Parish, Pilda Parish, Pureņi Parish, Rundēni Parish and Ludza town, the administrative centre being Ludza.
