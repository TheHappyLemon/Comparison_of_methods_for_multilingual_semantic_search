The Indian Grand Prix was a Formula One race in the calendar of the FIA Formula One World Championship, which was held at the Buddh International Circuit in sector 25 along Yamuna Expressway in Gautam Buddh Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh from 2011 until 2013. The first edition took place on 30 October 2011, as the 17th race of the 2011 Formula One season. The inaugural race was won by Germany's Sebastian Vettel. Jaypee Sports International Limited was the organizer of Formula One racing in India and had signed a five-year contract with Formula One Management (FOM) to host the championship in India. In August 2013, FIA announced that the Indian Grand Prix would miss the 2014 edition before returning to an early-season slot in 2015. Subsequently, due to a tax dispute with the Uttar Pradesh government, the 2015 edition was cancelled and its possible return delayed until 2016. However, no resolution was found and the grand prix has never been restored to the calendar.
