It stars Adam Sandler in his first appearance in a family film alongside Keri Russell, Guy Pearce, Aisha Tyler, Russell Brand, Richard Griffiths, Teresa Palmer, Lucy Lawless, and Courteney Cox. In the film, when a hotel handyman's stories to his niece and nephew come true, his stories become more outlandish.

Despite the film being a box office success, earning $212.9 million against an $80 million budget, it was panned by critics.
