The 2020 Gent–Wevelgem was a road cycling classic race that took place on 11 October 2020 in Belgium. It was the 82nd edition of Gent–Wevelgem and the eighteenth event of the 2020 UCI World Tour. One of the Spring Classics, Gent-Wevelgem was originally scheduled for 29 March 2020, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium. The race was rescheduled for 11 October 2020 as part of a new autumnal 'spring classics' season, though it was only the Belgian races which were eventually held.
