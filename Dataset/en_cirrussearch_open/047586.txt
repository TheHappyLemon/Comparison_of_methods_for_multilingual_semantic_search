The Ladoga ringed seal (Russian: Ладожская нерпа; Pusa hispida ladogensis) is a freshwater subspecies of the ringed seal (Pusa hispida) found entirely in Lake Ladoga in northwestern Russia. This pinniped was isolated in freshwater lakes and separated from the Arctic ringed seal as a result of the isostatic rebound of the region following the end of the Weichselian Glaciation. It is related to the even smaller population of Saimaa ringed seals in Lake Saimaa, a lake that flows into Ladoga through the Vuoksi River.
