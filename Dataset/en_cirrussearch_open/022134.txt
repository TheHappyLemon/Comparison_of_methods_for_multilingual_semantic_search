Túpac Katari 1 or TKSat-1 is a telecommunications satellite that the government of Bolivia outsourced to People's Republic of China (PRC) to serve telecommunications in Bolivia, such as mobile, television and Internet use. It was launched into orbit on 20 December 2013 from the Satellite Launch Center in Xichang, China, with a trial period of a little over three months, and commercial operation starting in March 2014. It was built on behalf of the Bolivian Space Agency. The China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC), a subsidiary of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), was responsible for the construction (using French, German and USA technology), launch and orbit of the satellite. The satellite is named after 18th century Bolivian independence activist Túpac Katari.
