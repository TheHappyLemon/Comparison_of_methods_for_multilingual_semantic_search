Příbram (Czech pronunciation: [ˈpr̝̊iːbram]; German: Freiberg in Böhmen or Pribram, in 1939–1945 Pibrans) is a town in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 33,000 inhabitants. It is well known for its mining history, and more recently, its new venture into economic restructuring. The town is the third-largest in the Central Bohemian Region (behind Kladno and Mladá Boleslav), and is a natural administrative and cultural centre of the south-western part of the region, although it also tends to be largely influenced by the proximity of Prague. The Svatá Hora pilgrimage site above the town is the oldest and most important Marian pilgrimage site in Bohemia. Příbram is also known for the Mining Museum Příbram.
