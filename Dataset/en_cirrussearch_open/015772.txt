The Citroën Xsara (/ˈzɑːrə/) is a compact C-segment family car, produced by the French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroën, under their Citroën marque, from 1997 to 2006. The Xsara was a development of the Citroën ZX and Peugeot 306, which shared a platform and running gear. It came in three and five door hatchback (notchback) and five door estate body styles; the estate was marketed as the Break and the three door as the Coupé. The styling shared cues with the larger Bertone designed Xantia, but was regarded as bland by the motoring press. The straight four engine range includes 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 litre petrol engines as well as 1.4, 1.6, 1.9 and 2.0 litre naturally aspirated and turbocharged diesels. In some countries, such as Portugal, the 1.5 litre TUD5 diesel engine was also available. The Xsara was 1998 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland.
