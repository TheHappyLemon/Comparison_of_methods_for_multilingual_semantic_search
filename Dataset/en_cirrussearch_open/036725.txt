An Erlenmeyer flask, also known as a conical flask (British English) or a titration flask, is a type of laboratory flask which features a flat bottom, a conical body, and a cylindrical neck. It is most often used in a laboratory. It is named after the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825–1909), who created it in 1860. Erlenmeyer flasks have wide bases and narrow necks. They may be graduated, and often spots of ground glass or enamel are used where they can be labeled with a pencil. It differs from the beaker in its tapered body and narrow neck. Depending on the application, they may be constructed from glass or plastic, in a wide range of volumes. The mouth of the Erlenmeyer flask may have a beaded lip that can be stoppered or covered. Alternatively, the neck may be fitted with ground glass or other connector for use with more specialized stoppers or attachment to other apparatus. A Büchner flask is a common design modification for filtration under vacuum.
