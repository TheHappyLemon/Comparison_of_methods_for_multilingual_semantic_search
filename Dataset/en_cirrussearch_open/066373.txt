The flag of the Republic of Dagestan (Russian: Флаг Дагестана; Avar: Дагъистаналъул байрахъ; Azerbaijani: Дағыстан бајрағы, romanized: Dağıstan bayrağı; Kumyk: Дагъыстаны байракъ) was adopted after the transformation of the Dagestan ASSR into the Republic of Dagestan within the Russian Federation. The flag was formally adopted on 26 February 1994. It features a horizontal tricolor of green (for Islam), blue (for the Caspian Sea), and red (for courage and fidelity). On 19 November 2003 the proportion of the flag was changed from the original 1:2 to 2:3, and the middle stripe from light blue to blue.
