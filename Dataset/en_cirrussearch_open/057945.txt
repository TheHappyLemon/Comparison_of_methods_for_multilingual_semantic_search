Woody Woodpecker (also known as Woody Woodpecker: The Movie) is a 2017 American live-action and animated slapstick comedy film directed by Alex Zamm, based on the cartoon character of the same name and produced by Universal 1440 Entertainment in co-production with Universal Animation Studios and distributed by Universal Pictures. The film stars Timothy Omundson, Graham Verchere, Jordana Largy and Thaila Ayala, and features Eric Bauza as the voice of Woody Woodpecker. The film's plot follows Woody protecting his forest from a real estate lawyer planning to build an investment house in his habitat. While Woody Woodpecker was filmed in English, it was only released theatrically in the Latin American market, which the film catered to and where the character is most popular. Elsewhere, it was released primarily as a direct-to-video feature. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $15.3 million. A sequel, Woody Woodpecker Goes to Camp, will be released in theaters and as a Netflix exclusive on April 12, 2024.
