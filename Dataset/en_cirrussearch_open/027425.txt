Cinemas of Latvia date back to 1910 when the first short films were made. The first cinematic screening in Riga took place on May 28, 1896. By 1914, all major cities in Latvia had cinemas where newsreels, documentaries, and mostly foreign-made short films were screened. Two years after cinema was invented by the Lumiere brothers, on 22 January 1898, Sergei Eisenstein was born in Riga.
