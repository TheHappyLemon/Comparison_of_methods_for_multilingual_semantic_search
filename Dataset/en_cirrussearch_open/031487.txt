Transaero (Russian: Трансаэро), officially OJSC Transaero Airlines (Russian: ОАО «АК „ТРАНСАЭРО“», Открытое акционерное общество «Авиационная компания „ТРАНСАЭРО“») was a Russian airline that operated scheduled and charter flights to over 150 domestic and international destinations. Transaero's main hubs were Moscow Vnukovo Airport and Saint Petersburg Airport, with further bases throughout Russia. For much of its history the head office was at Domodedovo International Airport, and towards the end its head office was in Saint Petersburg. Transaero filed for bankruptcy on 1 October 2015, and announced that it would cease all operations by 15 December the same year. However, Russian authorities revoked its operating license on 25 October. In September 2021, the Moscow Commercial Court extended Transaero's business failure until March 2022 following a motion by the airline's bankruptcy supervisor Alexey Belokopyt.
