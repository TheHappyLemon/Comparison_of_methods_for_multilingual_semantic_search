Romania first participated at the Olympic Games in 1900, with a single participant. The National Olympic Committee for Romania is the Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee, and was created and recognized in 1914. The nation first sent a team to compete at the Games in 1924, and has only missed two editions each of the Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games since then. Notably, Romania was the lone Eastern Bloc nation to participate at the 1984 Summer Olympics, which the other nations boycotted. That was also Romania's most successful Olympic Games: they won 20 gold medals and 53 medals in total. Gymnastics is Romania's top medal-producing sport. Romania has won the third highest total number of medals (after Hungary, and Poland) of nations that have never hosted the Games.
