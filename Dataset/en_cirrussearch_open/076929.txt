At the international level, he gained 19 caps for the San Marino national football team. Widely regarded as the best Sanmarinese player of all time, he is one of the few sportspeople from his country to have won a world title alongside motorcyclist Manuel Poggiali, jumper Elisabetta Rossi, and fisherman Marino Michelotti, he is regarded the most iconic athlete born in the country. For its 50th anniversary in 2004, UEFA asked each of its then 52 member associations to nominate one player as the single most outstanding player of the period 1954–2003, and Bonini was chosen as the Golden Player of San Marino by the San Marino Football Federation in November 2003.
