The Illusionist (French: L'Illusionniste) is a 2010 animated film written and directed by Sylvain Chomet. The film is based on an unproduced script written by French mime, director and actor Jacques Tati in 1956. Controversy surrounds Tati's motivation for the script, which was written as a personal letter to his estranged eldest daughter, Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel, in collaboration with his long-term writing partner Henri Marquet, between writing for the films Mon Oncle and Play Time. The main character is an elderly version of Tati, with hints of his character Monsieur Hulot. The plot revolves around a struggling illusionist who visits an isolated community and meets a young lady who is convinced that he is a real magician. Chomet relocated the film, originally intended by Tati to be set in Czechoslovakia, to Scotland in the late 1950s. According to the director, "It's not a romance, it's more the relationship between a dad and a daughter." Sony's US press kit declares that the "script for The Illusionist was originally written by French comedy genius and cinema legend Jacques Tati as a love letter from a father to his daughter, but never produced". The film received acclaim from critics, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, losing to Pixar's Toy Story 3. The Illusionist was the last film to be distributed by Path√© theatrically in the United Kingdom before being shut down in 2009 and focusing as a solo production company on British films starting in 2013 up until their shut down in November 2023.
