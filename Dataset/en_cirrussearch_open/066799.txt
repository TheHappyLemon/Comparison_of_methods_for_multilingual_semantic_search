Islam is the largest religion practiced in Kazakhstan, with estimates of about 72% of the country's population being Muslim. Ethnic Kazakhs are predominantly Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi school. There are also small numbers of Shias. Geographically speaking, Kazakhstan is the northernmost Muslim-majority country in the world, and the largest in terms of land area. Kazakhs make up over half of the total population, and other ethnic groups of Muslim background include Uzbeks, Uyghurs and Tatars. Islam first arrived on the southern edges of the region in the 8th century from Arabs. According to the Constitution, The Republic of Kazakhstan proclaims itself as a democratic, secular, legal and social state whose highest values are a person, his life, rights, and freedoms. Although Kazakhs identify with their Muslim heritage, religious practices are generally very moderate, and displays of religiosity, such as the wearing of the headscarf or daily attendance in mosques, are rare. However, observers have also noted a rise in religiosity and an overall Islamic revival (like in the region as a whole), Kazakhs who self-identify as Muslims rising from 79% in 2007 to 93% in 2012, while as of 2012, 10% of the Kazakhs practice Islam in its totality (praying five times a day and observing the Hijab for women), the youth also frequenting the mosques more often, whereas their number "appears to be growing every year." In 2019, there were 2500 mosques in the country, number which "increased 37-fold in the span of 25 years."
