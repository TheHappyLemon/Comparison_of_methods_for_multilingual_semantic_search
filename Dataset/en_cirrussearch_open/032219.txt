The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Barbados accepted the convention on April 9, 2002, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Barbados has only one World Heritage Site, Historic Bridgetown and its Garrison, which was inscribed in 2011.
