Mount Bazardüzü (Azerbaijani: Bazardüzü dağı, Azerbaijani pronunciation: [bɑzɑrdyˈzy]; Lezgian: Кичӏен сув [kiˈtʃʼe suv]; Russian: Базардюзю, Russian pronunciation: [bəzərdʲʉˈzʲu]) is a mountain peak in the Greater Caucasus range on the border between Russia (Dagestan) and Azerbaijan. At 4,466 metres (14,652 ft) above sea level, it is the highest peak in both Dagestan and Azerbaijan, and is located in the Qusar region. The southernmost point of Dagestan (and therefore Russia) is located about seven kilometers southwest of the peak. Translated from Azerbaijani, Bazarduzu means “market square”, more precisely as a specific landmark - “turn to the market, bazaar”.[citation needed] In the Middle Ages in the Shahnabad Valley, located east of this peak, annual large multinational fairs were held.[citation needed]
