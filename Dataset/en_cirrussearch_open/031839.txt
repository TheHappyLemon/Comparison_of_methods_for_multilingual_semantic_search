The Amur–Yakutsk Mainline (Russian: Амуро-Якутская магистраль, Amuro-Yakutskaya Magistral), abbreviated to AYaM (Russian АЯM), is a partially complete railway in eastern Russia, linking the Trans–Siberian Railway and Baikal–Amur Mainline with the Sakha Republic. Passenger services on the line go from Tynda to the town of Nizhny Bestyakh, opposite the river from Yakutsk. In November 2011, construction of the railway reached Nizhny Bestyakh. The final step required to bring the railway into the city itself is a combined road and rail bridge, to be constructed upstream of Yakutsk where the river is narrower. The railway via Nizhny Bestyakh is planned in the long term to form the start of a railway towards Magadan and possibly even across the Bering Strait.
