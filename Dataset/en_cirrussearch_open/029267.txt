"Black Smoke" is a song performed by German singer Ann Sophie. The song represented Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015, receiving zero points. Despite "Heart of Stone" by Andreas Kümmert being the original winner of the selection show Unser Song für Österreich, Kümmert decided to withdraw himself just when he was announced as the winner and therefore Ann Sophie and "Black Smoke" were chosen to represent the country. The song was co-written by British singer Ella Eyre. Black Smoke became the third German entry to get zero points at Eurovision, and the first one since Ulla Wiesner with "Paradies, wo bist du?" in 1965, 50 years earlier.
