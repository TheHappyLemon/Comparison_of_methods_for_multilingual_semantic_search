Ilya Alexeyevich Samsonov (/sæmˈsoʊ.nɔːv/, Russian: Илья Алексеевич Самсонов; born 22 February 1997) is a Russian professional ice hockey goaltender for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). Growing up in Magnitogorsk, Russia, Samsonov made his Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) debut playing in relief with Metallurg Magnitogorsk during the 2014–15 KHL season. After a successful junior season with Metallurg's Junior club, Stalnye Lisy, Samsonov was ranked as the top European Goalie in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. He was eventually drafted 22nd overall by the Washington Capitals despite missing the scouting combine in Buffalo and conducting no interviews with the team. Following the 2015 Draft, Samsonov returned to the KHL where he posted a 6–4–3 record with a 2.04 goals against average and .925 save percentage through 19 games. Following the 2017–18 KHL season, Samsonov embarked on his NHL career by signing a three-year, entry-level contract with the Washington Capitals. Samsonov participated in the Capitals training camp but was re-assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hershey Bears, prior to the start of the 2018–19 season. He eventually made his NHL debut the following season while playing in a primary backup role to starter Braden Holtby. Following his debut win, Samsonov subsequently won 10 more to become only the third NHL rookie goalie to win his first eleven contests and the first since 1973–74.
