Reversal of Fortune is a 1990 American drama film adapted from the 1985 book Reversal of Fortune: Inside the von B端low Case, written by law professor Alan Dershowitz. It recounts the true story of the unexplained coma of socialite Sunny von B端low, the subsequent attempted murder trial, and the eventual acquittal of her husband, Claus von B端low, who had Dershowitz as his defense attorney. The film was directed by Barbet Schroeder and stars Jeremy Irons as Claus, Glenn Close as Sunny, and Ron Silver as Dershowitz. Screenwriter Nick Kazan originally envisioned Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer in the role of Claus von B端low, but was thrilled with Irons' performance. Irons earned the 1990 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film.
