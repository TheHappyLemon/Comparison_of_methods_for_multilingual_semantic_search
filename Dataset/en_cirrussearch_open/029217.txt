Yukio Hatoyama (鳩山 友紀夫, born 鳩山 由紀夫, Hatoyama Yukio, born 11 February 1947) is a Japanese politician who served as Prime Minister of Japan and Leader of the Democratic Party of Japan from 2009 to 2010. He was the first Prime Minister from the modern Democratic Party of Japan. Hatoyama is currently the founder and leader of Kyowa Party, a minor political party established in 2020 after he announced his return to politics. First elected to the House of Representatives in 1986, Hatoyama became President of the DPJ, the main opposition party, in May 2009. He then led the party to victory in the August 2009 general election, defeating the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which had been in power for over a decade. He represented the Hokkaido 9th district in the House of Representatives from 1986 to 2012. In 2012, Hatoyama announced his retirement from politics. Since then, he has made large online presence such as on Twitter with his outspoken political views. He generated controversy when he visited Crimea in 2015 and claimed that the annexation by the Russian Federation was constitutional and falsely claimed that Ukraine and NATO would launch a nuclear strike against Russia in 2023. In 2020, Hatoyama formed the Kyowa Party and announced his intentions to re-enter Japanese politics.
