Overall Champions The 2021–22 Biathlon World Cup (BWC) was a multi-race series over a season of biathlon, organised by the International Biathlon Union. The season started on 27 November 2021 in Östersund, Sweden and ended on 20 March 2022 in Oslo Holmenkollen, Norway. Norwegians Johannes Thingnes Bø and Tiril Eckhoff were the defending overall champions from the 2020–21 season. For the first time in the history of the Biathlon World Cup, the competition will be held in Estonia, specifically in Otepää. Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian biathletes are only allowed to compete under a neutral flag since the competition in Kontiolahti. Their performances are not included in the previous classifications of their countries. Previously, the Ukrainian national team announced the withdrawal from the biathlon competition by the end of the season. On 2 March 2022, IBU announced that Russian and Belarusian biathletes are banned from IBU events. Polish biathlete Magdalena Gwizdoń starting in the sprint in Otepää broke the all-time record of the World Cup (starting in her 27th season). The previous record for starting in 26 seasons was held by Ole Einar Bjørndalen.
