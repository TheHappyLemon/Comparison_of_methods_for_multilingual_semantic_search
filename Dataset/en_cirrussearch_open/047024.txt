Ngerulmud (Palauan pronunciation: [ŋəˈɾulmuð]) is the seat of government of the Republic of Palau, an island nation in the Pacific Ocean. It replaced Koror City as a capital in 2006. The settlement is located in the state of Melekeok on Babeldaob, the country's largest island, located 20 kilometers (12 miles) northeast of Koror City and 2 km (1 mile) northwest of Melekeok City. It is the least-populous capital city of a sovereign nation in the world (although Plymouth, the destroyed—but still official—capital of Montserrat, a British overseas territory, is wholly uninhabited.).
