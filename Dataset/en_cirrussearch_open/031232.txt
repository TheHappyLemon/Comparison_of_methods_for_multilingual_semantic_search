Primary education or elementary education is typically the first stage of formal education, coming after preschool/kindergarten and before secondary school. Primary education takes place in primary schools, elementary schools, or first schools and middle schools, depending on the location. Hence, in the United Kingdom and some other countries, the term primary is used instead of elementary. There is no commonly agreed on duration of primary education, but often three-six years of elementary school, and in some countries (like the US) the first seven-nine years are considered primary education. The International Standard Classification of Education considers primary education as a single-phase where programs are typically designed to provide fundamental reading, writing, and mathematics skills and establish a solid foundation for learning. This is ISCED Level 1: Primary education or the first stage of basic education.
