Michelle Marie Pfeiffer (/ˈfaɪfər/ FY-fər; born April 29, 1958) is an American actress. Prolific in film for over four decades, she became one of Hollywood's most bankable stars during the 1980s and 1990s, as well as one of the era's defining sex symbols. She is known for pursuing a wide range of characters that span multiple genres, which have earned her various accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a British Academy Film Award, in addition to nominations for three Academy Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award. Beginning her acting career with minor television and film appearances, Pfeiffer attained her first leading role in the critically and commercially unsuccessful Grease 2 (1982). Disillusioned with being typecast in nondescript parts as attractive women, she achieved her breakout role as Elvira Hancock in Scarface (1983). Pfeiffer's mainstream success grew with performances in The Witches of Eastwick (1987) and Tequila Sunrise (1988), and she received her first of six consecutive Golden Globe Award nominations for Married to the Mob (1988). Her performances in Dangerous Liaisons (1988) and The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) earned her two consecutive Academy Award nominations, for Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress respectively, winning a Golden Globe Award for the latter. Pfeiffer went on to star in The Russia House (1990) and Frankie and Johnny (1991), making her one of the highest-paid actresses of the 1990s. In 1992, she played Catwoman in Batman Returns and received her third Academy Award nomination for Love Field, which were succeeded by performances in The Age of Innocence (1993) and Wolf (1994). She also produced several of her own star vehicles under her company Via Rosa Productions, including Dangerous Minds (1995). Opting to prioritize her family, she acted sporadically throughout the 2000s, appearing in What Lies Beneath (2000), White Oleander (2002), Hairspray, and Stardust (both 2007). Following another hiatus, Pfeiffer returned to prominence in 2017 with performances in Where Is Kyra?, Mother!, and Murder on the Orient Express, and received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for playing Ruth Madoff in The Wizard of Lies. In 2020, she received her eighth Golden Globe Award nomination for French Exit. Pfeiffer has played Janet van Dyne in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2018, beginning with Ant-Man and the Wasp.
