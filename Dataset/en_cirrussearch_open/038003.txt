Gutman's Cave (Latvian: Gūtmaņa ala) is the widest and highest cave in the Baltic countries, located by the Gauja River in the area known as the ancient Gauja valley [lt] in the Gauja National Park near Sigulda, Latvia. It started forming more than 10,000 years ago when meltwater eroded the sandstone rock after the Ice Age. It is the oldest tourist attraction in Latvia. On the walls of the cave are inscriptions from the 17th century. The legend of the Rose of Turaida began in this cave.
