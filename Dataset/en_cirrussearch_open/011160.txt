Db2 is a family of data management products, including database servers, developed by IBM. It initially supported the relational model, but was extended to support objectâ€“relational features and non-relational structures like JSON and XML. The brand name was originally styled as DB2 until 2017, when it changed to its present form. (In the early days, it was sometimes wrongly styled as DB/2 - in a false derivation from the operating system OS/2 .)
