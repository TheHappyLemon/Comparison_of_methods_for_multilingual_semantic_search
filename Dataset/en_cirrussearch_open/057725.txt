Säkkijärven polkka (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈsækːiˌjærʋen ˈpolkːɑ]; "the Säkkijärvi polka") is a well-known folk tune from Finland that is very popular with Finnish accordionists. It was especially popularized by Viljo "Vili" Vesterinen (1907–1961). The tune was first recorded in Säkkijärvi (now Kondratyevo in the Leningrad Oblast, Russia), and the lyrics sometimes sung with the tune, stating that while Säkkijärvi itself might have been lost (ceded to the Soviet Union in 1940), the Finns at least still had the polkka. Most famous and historical is the recording made on June 17, 1939 with former members of the Dallapé Orchestra. The recording took place in the ballroom of the German school in Helsinki. The recording became not only the savior of Viipuri, but also the most famous performance of all time of the Säkkijärvi polkka.
