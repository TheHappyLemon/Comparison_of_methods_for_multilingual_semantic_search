The De Havilland Canada DHC-8, commonly known as the Dash 8, is a series of turboprop-powered regional airliners, introduced by de Havilland Canada (DHC) in 1984. DHC was bought by Boeing in 1986, then by Bombardier in 1992, then by Longview Aviation Capital in 2019; Longview revived the De Havilland Canada brand. Powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW150s, it was developed from the Dash 7 with improved cruise performance and lower operational costs, but without STOL performance. The Dash 8 was offered in three sizes: the initial Series 100 (1984-2005) and the more powerful Series 200 (1995-2009) with 37-40 seats, the Series 300 (1989-2009) with 50-56 seats, and Series 400 (1999-Present) with 68-90 seats. The QSeries (Q for quiet) are post-1997 variants fitted with active noise control systems. Per a property transaction made by Bombardier before the 2019 sale to DHC, DHC had to vacate its Downsview, Toronto, manufacturing facility in August 2022, and as of AugustÂ 2023[update] is planning to restart Dash 8 production in Wheatland County, Alberta, by no later than 2033.
