PeR (Please Explain the Rhythm) is a Latvian pop and beatboxing band formed in 2007. The original line-up was Ralfs Eilands, Emīls Vegners, and Pēteris Upenieks. Vegners left the band in 2007 and was replaced by Edmunds Rasmanis. But when Upelnieks left the trio in 2011, he was not replaced, rendering the band a duo consisting of just Eilands and Rasmanis. After three failed attempts in earlier years to represent Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest, PeR won the 2013 Dziesma contest and represented the country in the 2013 Contest with the song "Here We Go" and placed last in the second semi-final.
