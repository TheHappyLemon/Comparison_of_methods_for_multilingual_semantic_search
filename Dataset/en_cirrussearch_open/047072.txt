Bush are an English rock band formed in London in 1992. Their current lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Gavin Rossdale, lead guitarist Chris Traynor, bassist Corey Britz, and drummer Nik Hughes. In 1994, Bush found immediate success outside the UK with the release of their debut album, Sixteen Stone, which is certified six times multi-platinum by the RIAA. They went on to become one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1990s, selling over ten million records in the United States and 20 million records worldwide. Despite their success in the US (especially in the mid-1990s), the band were considerably less popular in their home country and they have enjoyed only marginal success there. Bush have had numerous top ten singles on the Billboard rock charts and one No.Â 1 album with Razorblade Suitcase in 1996. The band broke up in 2002 but reformed in 2010, and have released five albums since then: The Sea of Memories (2011), Man on the Run (2014), Black and White Rainbows (2017), The Kingdom (2020), and The Art of Survival (2022).
