Marcos Aoás Corrêa (born 14 May 1994), also known as Marquinhos (Brazilian Portuguese: [maʁˈkĩj̃us]), is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain, which he captains, and the Brazil national team, which he vice-captains. Marquinhos began his career at Corinthians, and after winning the 2012 Copa Libertadores he moved to Roma for an eventual fee of €3 million. He was a regular in his only season as Roma reached the Coppa Italia final. In July 2013, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain for €31.4 million on a five-year contract, one of the highest fees for a player under the age of 20. Marquinhos played less frequently after the acquisition of compatriot David Luiz in 2014, returning to an integral role after the latter was sold in 2016. Marquinhos was part of PSG's team that reached the 2020 UEFA Champions League final. After Thiago Silva's departure in August 2020, Marquinhos took up the role of captain. His trophy cabinet with PSG includes eight Ligue 1 titles and twelve domestic cups, and he ranks second for all-time appearances for the club. Marquinhos made his full international debut for Brazil in 2013, and was part of their under-21 side which won the 2014 Toulon Tournament. He also represented the nation at the 2015 Copa América and the following year's Copa América Centenario, and won a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics. He subsequently took part at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the 2019 Copa América, the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 World Cup, winning the 2019 title.
