The Northern Dvina (Се́верная Двина́, IPA: [ˈsʲevʲɪrnəjə dvʲɪˈna]; Komi: Вы́нва, romanized: Výnva) is a river in northern Russia flowing through Vologda Oblast and Arkhangelsk Oblast into the Dvina Bay of the White Sea. Along with the Pechora River to the east, it drains most of Northwest Russia into the Arctic Ocean. It should not be confused with the Western Dvina. The principal tributaries of the Northern Dvina are the Vychegda (right), the Vaga (left), and the Pinega (right).
