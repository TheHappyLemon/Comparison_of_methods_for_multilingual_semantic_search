2013 GP2 Series Drivers' Champion: Fabio Leimer Teams' Champion: Russian Time Previous 2012 Next 2014 Parent series: Formula One Support series: GP3 Series The 2013 GP2 Series season was the forty-seventh season of the second-tier of Formula One feeder championship and also ninth season under the GP2 Series moniker, a support series to the 2013 Formula One World Championship. The 2013 season saw three new teams — Russian Time, Hilmer Motorsport and MP Motorsport — join the championship, replacing iSport International, Ocean Racing Technology and Scuderia Coloni. 2013 was scheduled to be the last season in which teams compete with the third-generation GP2 car — the Dallara GP2/11 — which was introduced in 2011, but series organisers decided to keep the GP2/11 for another three-year cycle in a bid to keep costs down. The season saw 10 different winners. Champion Fabio Leimer took 3 race wins, as runner-up Sam Bird took 5 victories, Jolyon Palmer took 2 race wins, as did Jon Lancaster. Stefano Coletti took 3 sprint race wins. Adrian Quaife-Hobbs, Nathanael Berthon, Marcus Ericsson and Alexander Rossi each took 1 race win, and ART Grand Prix driver James Calado took 2 race wins.
