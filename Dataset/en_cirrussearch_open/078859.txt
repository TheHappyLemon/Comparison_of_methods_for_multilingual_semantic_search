Psylloidea is a superfamily of true bugs, including the jumping plant lice and others which have recently been classified as distinct families. Though the group first appeared during the Early Jurassic, modern members of the group do not appear until the Eocene, and Mesozoic members of the order are usually assigned to the possibly paraphyletic family Liadopsyllidae.
