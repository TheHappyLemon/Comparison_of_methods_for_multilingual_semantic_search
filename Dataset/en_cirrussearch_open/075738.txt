The Charlotte Hornets are an American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Hornets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at the Spectrum Center in Uptown Charlotte. The franchise was originally established in 1988 by George Shinn as an expansion team. In 2002, the team relocated to New Orleans and later became the New Orleans Pelicans. Charlotte was granted a new franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats, which began play in the 2004–05 NBA season. Michael Jordan, a former NBA player and Hall of Famer, acquired a minority stake in the Bobcats in 2006 and became the majority owner in 2010. In 2013, the franchise announced a rebranding to reclaim the Charlotte Hornets name starting with the 2014–15 season, also reacquiring the history and records of the original Hornets franchise. The Hornets' history is notable for its rapid fanbase growth and competitive performances, despite the challenges of being an expansion team. Early successes in the 1990s under the leadership of players like Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning helped establish a strong foundation. The franchise experienced highs and lows, including playoff appearances and relocations. Jordan's acquisition of the team brought renewed interest and ambition, and a commitment to reconnect with the community and its basketball history. In August 2023, Jordan sold his majority stake to a group led by Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, though he retains a minority share.
