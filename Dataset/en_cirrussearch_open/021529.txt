The Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2014 was the 12th edition of the annual Junior Eurovision Song Contest, and took place, for the first time, in Malta. This was the third time that the contest was hosted by the previous year's winning country. Maltese national broadcaster PBS was the host broadcaster for the event. The final took place on 15 November 2014 and was in the Malta Shipbuilding in Marsa, near Valletta. Moira Delia, a Maltese television personality, hosted the show, marking the first time in Junior Eurovision history that there was only one presenter of the show. A total of sixteen countries participated, with Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia making their debuts. The winner of the contest was Vincenzo Cantiello, who represented Italy with the song "Tu primo grande amore". Bulgaria and Armenia finished in second and third place, respectively. This was Italy's first victory in a Eurovision competition since the last edition of Jeux Sans Frontières in 1999, and also marked the first time since the inaugural 2003 contest that a country had won in its débutante year.
