Bosnia and Herzegovina competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This was the nation's sixth appearance at the Summer Olympics. Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina (OKBIH) sent a total of 6 athletes to the Games, 4 men and 2 women, to compete only in athletics, judo, shooting, and swimming. Bosnian athletes included Kenyan-born marathon runner Lucija Kimani, and rifle shooter Nedžad Fazlija, who participated at his fifth Olympic games without winning an Olympic medal. Heavyweight judoka Amel Mekić became the nation's flag bearer for the second time at the opening ceremony. Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, has yet to win its first Olympic medal as an independent nation.
