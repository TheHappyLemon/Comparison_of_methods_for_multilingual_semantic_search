An orchestra pit is an area in a theater (usually located in a lowered area in front of the stage) in which musicians perform. The orchestra plays out of general sight in the pit, rather than on the stage as for a concert, when providing music for forms of theatre that require it (such as opera and ballet) or when incidental music is required. The conductor typically stands at the front of the orchestra pit facing the stage.
