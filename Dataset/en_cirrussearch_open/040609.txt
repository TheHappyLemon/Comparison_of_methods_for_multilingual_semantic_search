Karaj (Persian: کرج; pronounced [kæˈɾædʒ] ) is a city in the Central District of Karaj County, Alborz province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district. Although the county hosts a population around 1.97 million, as recorded in the 2016 census, most of the 1,419 km2 (548 sq mi) county is rugged mountain. The urban area is the fourth-largest in Iran, after Tehran, Mashhad, and Isfahan. Eshtehard County and Fardis County were split off from Karaj County since the previous census. At the National Census of 2006, Karaj had a population of 1,377,450 in 385,955 households, when it was in Tehran province. The latest census in 2016 counted 1,592,492 people in 508,420 households, by which time the county had separated from the province and become a part of recently established Alborz province. The earliest records of Karaj date back to the 30th century BC. The city was developed under the rule of the Safavid and Qajar dynasties and is home to historical buildings and memorials from those eras. This city has a unique climate due to access to natural resources such as many trees, rivers, and green plains. After Tehran, Karaj is the largest immigrant-friendly city in Iran, so it has been nicknamed "Little Iran."
