The Cardigans are a Swedish pop rock band formed in Jönköping, Sweden, in 1992 by guitarist Peter Svensson, bassist Magnus Sveningsson, drummer Bengt Lagerberg, keyboardist Lars-Olof Johansson and lead singer Nina Persson. Post-hiatus shows since 2012 have been with Oskar Humlebo on guitar instead of Svensson. With their debut album Emmerdale (1994) they gained a solid base in their home country and enjoyed some success abroad, especially in Japan. Their second album Life (1995) secured them an international reputation. Their popularity rose when their single "Lovefool", from the album First Band on the Moon (1996), was included in the soundtrack to the 1996 film Romeo + Juliet. Other singles included "Erase/Rewind" and "My Favourite Game" from the album Gran Turismo (1998). After a two-year hiatus the band returned to recording, and released their fifth album Long Gone Before Daylight (2003), a mellower country-flavoured record. Their latest album, as of March 2024, is Super Extra Gravity (2005). After a 2006 tour, the band took a five-year break from musical activities before reuniting in 2012 to play several concerts. They have sold over 15 million albums worldwide.
