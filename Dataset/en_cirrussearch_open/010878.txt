Chellsie Marie Memmel (born June 23, 1988) is an American artistic gymnast. She is the 2005 world all-around champion (the third American woman, after Kim Zmeskal and Shannon Miller, to win that title) and the 2003 world champion on the uneven bars. She was a member of the United States women's gymnastics team at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China. With a total of seven World Championship and Olympic medals, Memmel is tied with Shawn Johnson as the eighth most decorated American female gymnast, behind Simone Biles (34), Shannon Miller (16), Nastia Liukin (14), Alicia Sacramone (11), Aly Raisman (10), Jade Carey (8), and Dominique Dawes (8). Her return to gymnastics in her 30s attracted attention to the idea that by avoiding over-training and mistreatment, gymnasts could continue to perform at a high level in adulthood. She was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2022.
