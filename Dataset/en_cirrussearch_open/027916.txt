The São Paulo Metro (Portuguese: Metrô de São Paulo, [meˈtɾo dʒi sɐ̃w ˈpawlu]), commonly called the Metrô, is a rapid transit system that forms part of the urban railways that serves the city of São Paulo, alongside the São Paulo Metropolitan Trains Company (CPTM), both forming the largest metropolitan rail transport network of Latin America. The six lines in the metro system operate on 104.4 kilometres (64.9 mi) of route, serving 89 stations. The metro system carries about 4,000,000 passengers a day. Metro itself is far from covering the entire urban area in the city of São Paulo and only runs within the city limits. However, it is complemented by a network of metropolitan trains operated by CPTM and ViaMobilidade, which serve the city of São Paulo and the São Paulo Metropolitan Region. The two systems combined form a 380 km (240 mi) long network. The metropolitan trains differs from Metro because it also serves other municipalities around São Paulo with larger average distance between stations and freight trains operating in some lines (except for the Line 9 - Emerald, which has almost no differences to the Metro lines).[citation needed] Considered the most modern in Latin America, the system is the first to install platform screen doors at a station, and use communications-based train control with lines 4 and 15 being fully automated. Line 15 is a monorail line that partially opened for service in 2014 and is the first high capacity monorail line of Latin America. The São Paulo Metro and CPTM both operate as State-owned companies and have received awards in the recent past as one of the cleanest systems in the world by ISO9001. The São Paulo Metro was voted Best Metro Americas at the MetroRail 2010 industry conference and has been frequently chosen as one of the best metro systems in the world by specialist media outlets such as CNN and Business Insider, being the only system in Latin America to make the list.
