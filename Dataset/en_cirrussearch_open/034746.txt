The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Antigua and Barbuda accepted the convention on November 1, 1983, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Antigua and Barbuda has only one World Heritage Site, Nelson's Dockyard, which was inscribed in 2016.
