Gregor Foitek (German pronunciation: [ˈɡʁeːɡoːɐ̯ ˈfo.iːtɛk]; born 27 March 1965) is a Swiss former racing driver. He won the 1986 Swiss Formula 3 Championship. Moving up to Formula 3000 he was widely blamed for causing a race-stopping crash at Brands Hatch in 1988, the restart of which led to a second major crash on the first lap in which Johnny Herbert sustained major leg injuries. Foitek participated in 22 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 26 March 1989. He scored no championship points. He later made two CART starts for Foyt Enterprises in 1992 but was knocked out of both races by mechanical issues. Today he helps run Foitek Automobile, a family-run Ferrari and Maserati dealership in Altendorf.
