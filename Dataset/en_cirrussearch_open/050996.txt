Visingsö is an island in the southern half of Lake Vättern in Sweden. Visingsö lies 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of the city Jönköping and 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) west of Gränna from which two car ferries connect the island. The island is 14 kilometres (8.7 miles) long and 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) wide, with a total area of 24 square kilometres (9.3 square miles). According to legend, a giant named Vist created Visingsö by throwing a lump of soil into the lake so that his wife could use it to step over the lake.
