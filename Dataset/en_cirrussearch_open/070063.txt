The Caraballo Mountains is a mountain range in the central part of Luzon island in the Philippines, situated between the Cordillera Central and Sierra Madre mountain ranges. The mountains serve as the location of the river source of the Cagayan River, the longest in the country. Several portions of the mountain range are protected under the National Integrated Protected Areas System, including the Casecnan Protected Landscape and the Pantabanganâ€“Carranglan Watershed Forest Reserve.
