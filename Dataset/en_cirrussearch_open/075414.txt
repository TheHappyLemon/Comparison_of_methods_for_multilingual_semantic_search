B'Day Anthology Video Album is the third DVD by American singer Beyoncé. It was released through Columbia Records, Sony Music and Music World Entertainment exclusively through Walmart stores on April 3, 2007 alongside the deluxe edition, but was later serviced to other retailers. The DVD features thirteen music videos for songs from her second studio album, B'Day (2006) and its deluxe edition (2007). Beyoncé shot nine videos for the album, and four pre-filmed videos were also included. B'Day Anthology Video Album has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Outside North America, the album was featured as a bonus disc to the deluxe edition of B'Day. The "Still in Love (Kissing You)" video was the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit, therefore only initial pressings of the album contain its video.
