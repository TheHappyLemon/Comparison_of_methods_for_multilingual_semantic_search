At the 1900 Summer Olympics, a Basque pelota tournament was contested. Only two teams entered - one from Spain and one from France - but the French team of Maurice Durquetty and Etchegaray withdrew on the afternoon of the single contest due to a disagreement about the rules. Therefore, the contest was scratched and the Spanish team were awarded first prize. This is the only Olympics to date where pelota was an official sport, being revived at the 1924, 1968 and 1992 Games as a demonstration sport.
