Lake Köyceğiz is an alluvial set lake in the Muğla Province of Turkey. Having an area of 5200 hectares, it is one of the vastest coastal lakes in the country. It bears the name of the town of Köyceğiz, situated on its north bank. It is connected to the Mediterranean through a narrow and reedy channel called "Dalyan" which flows by a township of the same name (Dalyan) and the ancient city of Kaunos. Dalyan channel joins the sea at İztuzu Beach. The surroundings of the lake as a whole and particularly the banks of its Dalyan sea connection are important nature reserves and popular tourist attractions.
