The X Factor is a television music competition franchise created by British producer Simon Cowell and his company Syco Entertainment. It originated in the United Kingdom, where it was devised as a replacement for Pop Idol (2001â€“2003), and has been adapted in various countries. The "X Factor" of the title refers to the undefinable "something" that makes for star quality. Similar to Got Talent, the franchise maintains a YouTube channel, called X Factor Global. The channel uploads clips of X Factor shows from around the world. The channel currently has over 3 million subscribers. Additionally, many individual X Factor shows have their own YouTube channels such as X Factor Latvia.
