The triple jump, sometimes referred to as the hop, step and jump or the hop, skip and jump, is a track and field event, similar to long jump. As a group, the two events are referred to as the "horizontal jumps". The competitor runs down the track and performs a hop, a bound and then a jump into the sand pit. The triple jump was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games and has been a modern Olympics event since the Games' inception in 1896. According to World Athletics rules, "the hop shall be made so that an athlete lands first on the same foot as that from which he has taken off; in the step he shall land on the other foot, from which, subsequently, the jump is performed." The male world record holder is Jonathan Edwards of the United Kingdom, with a jump of 18.29 m (60 ft 0 in). The female world record holder is Yulimar Rojas of Venezuela, with a jump of 15.74 m (51 ft 7+1⁄2 in).
