Johann Friedrich von Recke (1 August 1764 – 13 September 1846) was a senior public official in the Baltic Germans Duchy of Courland. He is remembered now, primarily, for his activities as an antiquarian and collector. Following his withdrawal from government service he became the co-compiler of the General Writers and Scholars Lexicon of the Provinces of Latvia, Estonia and Courland (Allgemeine Schriftsteller- und Gelehrten-Lexikon der Provinzen Livland, Esthland und Kurland).
