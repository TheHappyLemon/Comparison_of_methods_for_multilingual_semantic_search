The Kingdom of Livonia was a nominal state in what is now the territory of Estonia and Latvia. Russian tsar Ivan IV declared the establishment of the kingdom during the Livonian War of 1558â€“1583, but it never functioned properly as a polity. In 1570, Magnus, Duke of Holstein was crowned in Moscow as the king of Livonia. Magnus left Moscow with a Russian army with the intention of conquering Swedish-controlled Reval, but called off the siege in 1571 after failing to capture the city. Magnus eventually fell out of favour with Ivan and defected.
