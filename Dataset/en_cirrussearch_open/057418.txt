The current area is 490 square kilometres and the majority of the national park sites are located within the Danube and Drava floodland areas, of which 190Â km2 are Ramsar wetlands. Black stork and White-tailed eagle populations are of European significance. Seven invertebrate species are found only here in Hungary. Habitats along the Drava host more than 400 protected plants and animals. Species endemic to national park areas include the black hawthorn and the Drava caddis fly.
