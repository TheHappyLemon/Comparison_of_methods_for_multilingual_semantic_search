Liechtenstein Castle (German: Burg Liechtenstein) is a castle near Maria Enzersdorf in Lower Austria, bordering Vienna. It is on the edge of the Wienerwald (Vienna Woods). Liechtenstein (German for "bright stone") Castle is the eponymous ancestral seat and place of origin of the House of Liechtenstein, the ruling family of the Principality of Liechtenstein. The family owned the castle from the middle of the 12th century until the 13th century, and again from 1808 to the present.
