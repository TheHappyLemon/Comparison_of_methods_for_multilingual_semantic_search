Kazakhstan is divided into 17 regions (Kazakh: облыстар, romanized: oblystar; sg. облыс, oblys; Russian: области, romanized: oblasti; sg. область, oblast). The regions are further subdivided into districts (Kazakh: аудандар, romanized: audandar; sg. аудан, audan; Russian: районы, romanized: rayony; sg. район, rayon). Three cities, Almaty, Shymkent, and the capital city Astana, do not belong to their surrounding regions.

Ulytau Region was created from Karaganda Region with its capital in Jezkazgan. Jetisu Region was created from Almaty Region with its capital in Taldykorgan; Almaty Region's capital was moved from Taldykorgan to Qonayev.
