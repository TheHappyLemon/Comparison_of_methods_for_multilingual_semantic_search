In the Soviet Union, latinisation or latinization (Russian: латиниза́ция, romanized: latinizatsiya) was the name of the campaign during the 1920s and 1930s which aimed to replace traditional writing systems for all languages of the Soviet Union with systems that would use the Latin script or to create Latin-script-based systems for languages that, at the time, did not have a writing system. Most of these alphabets are defunct and several (especially for languages in the Caucasus) contain multiple letters that do not have Unicode support as of 2023.
