Abasan al-Kabira (Arabic: عبسان الكبيرة) is a Palestinian city located in the Khan Yunis Governorate of the State of Palestine, in the southern Gaza Strip. It is connected with Khan Yunis city by a local street that crosses other villages like Bani Suheila and Khuza'a. Abasan al-Kabera and the nearby village of Abasan al-Saghira, have in recent years been built up to each other so that they form a larger urban area around Khan Yunis.[citation needed] According to the 2017 census conducted by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the city had a population of 26,767. The city primarily depends on agriculture for income. Moreover, small industry is involved with producing construction supplies like bricks and agricultural implements, while some residents work in commerce. The society is strongly influenced by tribal structure so, there are many extended families such as Qudayh in (Arabic: قديح) (the Ashraaf of the Holy Land), Alshawaf, Al-Daghmah, M'ssabih, Abu Yousef, Abu Mustafa, Abu Tair, Abu Dagga, Abu Tabash, Abu Draz, Abu Mutlaq, Abu Hamed, Abu Subha and Abu Amer, Abu Tuaima. The families generally turn to custom to solve disputes amongst themselves.[citation needed]
