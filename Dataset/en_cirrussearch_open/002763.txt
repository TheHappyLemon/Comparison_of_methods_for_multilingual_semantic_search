"Pursuit of Happiness" is a song by American musician Kid Cudi, respectively featuring production and vocals from American electronic rock duo Ratatat and American neo-psychedelic act MGMT. The song was officially released on September 15, 2009, as the third single from Cudi's debut album, Man on the Moon: The End of Day (2009). The meaning of the song is often misconstrued with being about the positive side of a carefree lifestyle, when rather it tells a dark tale of drinking and driving as well as the regret and pain associated with drug abuse and how it leads to escapism. The song was certified diamond (10 million units) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in December 2022.
