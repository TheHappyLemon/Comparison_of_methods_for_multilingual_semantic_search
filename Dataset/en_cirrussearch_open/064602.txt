Leland Tyler Wayne (born September 16, 1993), known professionally as Metro Boomin, is an American record producer. Critically acclaimed for his dark production style, he is regarded as among the most influential producers in modern hip hop and trap music. His frequent collaborators include Future, Young Thug, the Weeknd, Travis Scott, Don Toliver, 21 Savage, Gucci Mane, Gunna and Nav. Raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Wayne began his career in music production in 2009 at the age of 16; he relocated to Atlanta to attend Morehouse College in 2011 and continued to work extensively with Atlanta-based artists Future, Young Thug, 21 Savage, Gucci Mane, and Migos. Wayne gained wider recogntion for producing the 2014 single "Tuesday" for iLoveMakonnen, which peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. He was credited on a string of similarly successful singles throughout 2016, including "Jumpman" by Drake and Future, "Low Life" by Future, and his first number one, "Bad and Boujee" by Migos. This was followed by "Congratulations" by Post Malone, "Tunnel Vision" by Kodak Black, "Mask Off" by Future, "Bank Account" by 21 Savage, and his second number one, "Heartless" by the Weeknd. As a non-performing lead artist, Wayne has released the collaborative projects Savage Mode (2016) and Savage Mode II (2020) with 21 Savage, DropTopWop (2017) with Gucci Mane, Perfect Timing (2017) with Nav, Double or Nothing (2017) with Big Sean, and We Don't Trust You (2024) with Future. Wayne's debut studio album, Not All Heroes Wear Capes (2018) and its follow-up, Heroes & Villains (2022) both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter spawned the single "Creepin" (with the Weeknd and 21 Savage), which peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and within the top ten in several countries. We Don't Trust You spawned the single "Like That" (with Future and Kendrick Lamar), which became his first song to debut atop the chart as a lead artist.
