NEE-02 Krysaor is an Ecuadorian technology demonstration satellite, and Ecuador's second satellite launched to space. Built by the Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency (EXA), it is a single-unit CubeSat nanosatellite. Krysaor is a Pegasus-class spacecraft, a "twin" of Ecuador's first satellite, NEE-01 Pegaso. Like Pegaso, this spacecraft's instruments include a dual visible and infrared camera which allows the spacecraft to take pictures and transmit live video from space.
