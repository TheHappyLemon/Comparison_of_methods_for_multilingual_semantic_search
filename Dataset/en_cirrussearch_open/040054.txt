The black-throated thrush (Turdus atrogularis) is a passerine bird in the thrush family. It is sometimes regarded as one subspecies of a polytypic species, "dark-throated thrush", red-throated thrush then being the other subspecies. More recent treatments regard the two as separate species. The black-throated thrush is a migratory Eastern Palearctic species. Its range overlaps with the more easterly-breeding red-throated thrush.
