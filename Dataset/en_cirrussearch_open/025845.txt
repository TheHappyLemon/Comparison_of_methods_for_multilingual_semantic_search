Guldhjälmen (lit. 'The Gold Helmet') comprises two Swedish annual ice hockey awards that recognize the most valuable player of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) and of the Swedish Women's Hockey League (SDHL) as judged by each league's players, respectively. Guldhjälmen is sponsored by the Swedish Magasinet Hockey in cooperation with CCM Hockey and TV4. Guldhjälmen was introduced in 1986 as Elitserien (renamed SHL in 2013) award. It is analogous to the NHL's Ted Lindsay Award, a MVP award voted on by members of the NHL Players' Association, and is the companion of the Viking Award, which recognizes the best Swedish player active in North America as determined by player vote. It should not be confused with Guldpucken (lit. 'The Golden Puck'), which is awarded the to the men's Swedish Player of the Year by Expressen and the Swedish Ice Hockey Association. The first winner was Finnish defenseman Kari Eloranta of HV71 for the 1985–86 Elitserien season. Winger Joakim Lindström has received Guldhjälmen three times, once more than any other player in history. The award was expanded to encompass the player-selected MVP of the SDHL in 2020. Following the 2019–20 SDHL season, Swiss forward Lara Stalder of Brynäs IF was selected to become the first woman to win Guldhjälmen by vote of SDHL players. Guldhjälmen should not be confused with the Kronprinsessan Margaretas pris (lit. 'Crown Princess Margareta's Award'), also known as the SDHL MVP, which is awarded to the most valuable player of the SDHL as chosen by the Swedish Ice Hockey Association.
