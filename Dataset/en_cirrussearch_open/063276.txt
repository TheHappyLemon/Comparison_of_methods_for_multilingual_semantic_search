Olympic Park Munich 500m 550yds 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1    Olympiastadion (German pronunciation: [ʔoˈlʏmpi̯aːˌʃtaːdi̯ɔn] ) is a stadium located in Munich, Germany. Situated at the heart of the Olympiapark München in northern Munich, the stadium was the main venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics. The original capacity was maximally and officially around 75,000 seats, during the Olympics; yet average audiences of 80,000 to 90,000 people were registered daily. Also, the stadium has hosted many major football matches including the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final and the UEFA Euro 1988 Final – originally the official capacity was 73.000 for football. The stadium hosted European Cup Finals in 1979, 1993 and 1997. Its current capacity is 63,118 seated spectators. The stadium has also hosted various concerts, with capacity up to 77,337 depending on configuration. Until the construction of Allianz Arena for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was home to Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich. Football is still played at this venue, which is usually used for the Regionalliga Bayern club Türkgücü Munich. Unlike the Olympiastadion, the new stadium was purpose-built for football alone.
