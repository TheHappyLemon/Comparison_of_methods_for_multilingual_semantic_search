Ceire Cion (Hebrew: צעירי ציון, "Youth of Zion"), sometimes called the Zionist Party or Ethnic Socialist Party, was a centre-left Jewish political party in Latvia during the inter-war period. It was led by jurist Max Lazerson. The party combined the ideas of Zionism and democratic socialism. One of the party's goals was to create a Jewish state in Palestine.
