The French Bulldog (French: Bouledogue Fran√ßais) is a French breed of companion dog or toy dog. It appeared in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century, apparently the result of cross-breeding of Toy Bulldogs imported from England and local Parisian ratters. It is commonly kept as a pet, and is among the most frequently registered dogs in a number of countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The breed is susceptible to various health issues as a consequence of breeding for their distinctive appearance, especially the brachycephalic face and skin wrinkles.
