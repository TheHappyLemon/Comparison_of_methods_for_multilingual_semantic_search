The Intelligence College in Europe (ICE) is an intergovernmental entity, independent of the European Union institutions, inaugurated in March 2019 in Paris. ICE aims to bring together all the intelligence communities (civilian, military, internal, external and technical services) of European countries, national and European decision-makers as well as the academic world in order to stimulate strategic thinking and thus develop a common intelligence culture.
