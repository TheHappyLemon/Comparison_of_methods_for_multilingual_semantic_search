The Inhul (Ukrainian: Інгул) is a left tributary of the Southern Bug (Boh) and is the 14th longest river of Ukraine. It flows through the Kirovohrad and Mykolaiv regions. It starts near the village of Rodnykivka, Oleksandriia Raion in Kirovohrad Oblast (Central Ukraine), flowing south towards the Southern Bug at Mykolaiv, which is 65 km (40 mi) north (up river) from where the Southern Bug empties into the Black Sea. The Inhul River is 354 km (220 mi) long. The river valley is mostly trapezium-like with a width of up to 4 km and a depth of up to 60 meters. At the upper stream it has a narrow winding channel that cuts through the Dnieper Upland, and its rocky banks show granite and gneiss; at the middle and lower stream after entering the Black Sea Lowland, it widens up to 30 meters and over. The river freezes over in December and thaws sometime in March. Among major cities on the river are Kropyvnytskyi and Mykolaiv.
