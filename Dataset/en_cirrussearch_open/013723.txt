Street Fighter X Tekken (pronounced "Street Fighter Cross Tekken") is a crossover fighting game developed and published by Capcom and released in March 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in May for Windows and in October for the PlayStation Vita. The game features characters from both the Street Fighter franchise and Namco's Tekken series. In the game, each player selects two characters respectively and face other as duos in tag team fighting matches, with the objective to knock out one of the members from the opposing team (deplete the opponent's health). In addition to the game's multiplayer modes, the game also features a single-player Story mode with a plot revolving around a mysterious object called the "Pandora". The game is the product of a partnership between Namco and Capcom that previously produced the role-playing game Namco Ã— Capcom. As Street Fighter X Tekken was made by Capcom (with Namco being involved more in the licensing of the Tekken cast), the gameplay is based on the 2D gameplay of Street Fighter, with projectile moves such as the Hadouken, as opposed to the Tekken series. Unique features in Street Fighter X Tekken include: the Gem System, which allows players to equip special gems to power-up various character attributes and Pandora Mode, in which a character's strength and abilities are temporarily augmented. Namco was also set to produce their own take on the crossover, Tekken X Street Fighter, which would follow their 3D style of gameplay; however, development has been on hold since 2016. The game was well received by critics, who complimented the roster and deep game mechanics. Nevertheless, it fell short of Capcom's sales expectations. In addition, Capcom's release of downloadable content (DLC) for the game was met with criticism when it was revealed that the company was charging for access to characters that were already on the game disc.
