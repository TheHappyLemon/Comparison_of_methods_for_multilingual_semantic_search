Demi Gene Moore (/dəˈmiː/ də-MEE; née Guynes; born November 11, 1962) is an American actress and producer. She first gained attention on daytime television, before breaking out as a film star in the 1980s. By the mid 1990s, she was the highest-paid actress at the time. She has earned several accolades throughout her career, including nominations for an Emmy Award, two Golden Globe Awards and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Moore began acting in 1981, and appeared on the soap opera General Hospital (1982–1984). After departing the show, she rose to prominence as a member of the Brat Pack, starring in the films Blame It on Rio (1984), St. Elmo's Fire (1985), and About Last Night... (1986). She earned recognition and stardom for her role in Ghost (1990), which was the highest-grossing film of its year. She had further box-office successes with A Few Good Men (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993), and Disclosure (1994), and received $12.5 million to star in Striptease (1996), becoming the highest-paid actress to that point. Moore was considered to be one of the most bankable stars of the 1990s. Moore's career saw a downturn after the films The Scarlet Letter (1995), The Juror (1996), and G.I. Jane (1997) fell below commercial expectations. Since then, her career has seen a resurgence with roles in Passion of Mind (2000), Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003), Bobby (2006), Mr. Brooks (2007), Flawless (2008), Margin Call (2011), and Blind (2017). Her television projects include If These Walls Could Talk (1996), Empire (2015–2017), Brave New World (2020), and Feud: Capote vs. The Swans (2024). Her memoir Inside Out (2019) became a New York Times Best Seller. Moore has been married thrice. From 1981 to 1985, she was married to musician Freddy Moore. From 1987 to 2000, she was married to Bruce Willis, with whom she has three daughters. She was married to Ashton Kutcher from 2005 to 2013.
