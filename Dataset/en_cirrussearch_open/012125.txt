Anthony "Fat Tony" D'Amico is the name of two recurring characters in the animated sitcom The Simpsons. Both are voiced by Joe Mantegna and first appeared in the episode "Bart the Murderer" of the third season. Fat Tony is a mobster and the underboss of the Springfield Mafia. His henchmen include Legs, Louie, and Johnny Tightlips, and he answers to Don Vittorio DiMaggio. Upon the death of the original Fat Tony in the episode "Donnie Fatso" of the twenty-second season, the character's near-identical cousin of the same name is introduced. The characters somewhat resemble real-life mobster Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno.
