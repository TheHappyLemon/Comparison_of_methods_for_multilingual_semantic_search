A language model is a probabilistic model of a natural language. In 1980, the first significant statistical language model was proposed, and during the decade IBM performed ‘Shannon-style’ experiments, in which potential sources for language modeling improvement were identified by observing and analyzing the performance of human subjects in predicting or correcting text. Language models are useful for a variety of tasks, including speech recognition (helping prevent predictions of low-probability (e.g. nonsense) sequences), machine translation, natural language generation (generating more human-like text), optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, and information retrieval. Large language models, currently their most advanced form, are a combination of larger datasets (frequently using scraped words from the public internet), feedforward neural networks, and transformers. They have superseded recurrent neural network-based models, which had previously superseded the pure statistical models, such as word n-gram language model.
