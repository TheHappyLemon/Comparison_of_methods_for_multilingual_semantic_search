Charlie's Angels is a 2019 American action comedy film written and directed by Elizabeth Banks from a story by Evan Spiliotopoulos and David Auburn. It stars Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, and Ella Balinska as the new generation of Angels who are working for a private detective agency named the Townsend Agency. The film is the third installment in the Charlie's Angels film series and serves as a continuation of the story that began with the television series of the same name by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, and the two previous theatrical films, Charlie's Angels (2000) and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003). Development of the film began in September 2015 when Sony Pictures opted to reboot the series following the cancellation of the 2011 television reboot and the release of 2003's Full Throttle. Months later, Banks joined the project as director, producer, and writer. Casting announcements were made throughout 2018, with Banks herself also confirmed to star. Principal photography commenced in September 2018 and took place in Germany and Turkey. The lead single from the film's soundtrack, "Don't Call Me Angel", performed by Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Del Rey, was released in September 2019, followed by the soundtrack and score album's respective releases on November 1 and 8. Charlie's Angels was theatrically released in the United States on November 15, 2019, by Sony Pictures Releasing to mixed reviews from critics and a poor opening weekend box office performance. It was ranked by both USA Today and Variety as one of the biggest box-office disappointments of 2019. The film eventually grossed $73.3 million worldwide against an estimated production budget of $48â€“55 million and an estimated advertising budget of $50 million.
