An election of the delegation from Latvia to the European Parliament was held on 25 May 2019. The previous elections were held in 2014. The election uses the Sainte-LaguÃ« method, which is weighted against the larger parties. That explains why, according to the results of one opinion poll, parties with 6% of the vote would be allocated one seat each, while a party with 17% of the vote would also be allocated only one seat.
