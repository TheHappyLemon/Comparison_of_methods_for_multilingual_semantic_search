The 2017 Volta a Catalunya was a road cycling stage race that took place between 20 and 26 March. It was the 97th edition of the Volta a Catalunya and the ninth event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. The race was won for the second time by Movistar Team rider Alejandro Valverde, who – like all of his teammates received a one-minute time penalty in the team time trial stage of the race – won three stages, the mountains classification as well as the overall general classification. Valverde finished over a minute clear of his next closest competitor; Alberto Contador finished second for Trek–Segafredo, 63 seconds in arrears of Valverde. The podium was completed by Valverde's teammate Marc Soler – taking the young rider classification as a result – a further 13 seconds adrift of Contador. In the other classifications, the performances for Valverde and Soler were good enough for the Movistar Team to win the teams classification, while Cannondale–Drapac's Pierre Rolland won the intermediate sprints classification.
