No is a 2012 historical drama film directed by Pablo Larraín. The film is based on the unpublished stage play El Plebiscito written by Antonio Skármeta. Mexican actor Gael García Bernal plays René, an in-demand advertising man working in Chile in the late 1980s. The film captures the advertising tactics in the political campaigns for the 1988 Chilean national plebiscite, when the citizenry decided whether or not dictator Augusto Pinochet should stay in power for another eight years. At the 85th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.
