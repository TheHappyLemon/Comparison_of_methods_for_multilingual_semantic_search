The Federative Republic of Brazil accepted the convention on 1 September 1977, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, there are 23 World Heritage Sites in Brazil, including fifteen cultural sites, seven natural sites and one mixed site. The first site in Brazil, the Historic Town of Ouro Preto, was inscribed on the list at the 4th Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Paris, France in 1980. In 1983, Jesuit Missions of the Guaranis was accepted to the list in a joint bid with Argentina, making it Brazil's first trans-border property. Iguaçu National Park was enlisted in 1986 as the first site selected for its natural significance. Brazil's latest contribution to the World Heritage List, the Sítio Roberto Burle Marx, was inscribed in 2021. In addition to its inscribed sites, Brazil also maintains twenty-three properties on its tentative list.
