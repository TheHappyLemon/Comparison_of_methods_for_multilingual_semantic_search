The People's Choice Awards is an American awards show, recognizing people in entertainment, voted online by the general public and fans. The show has been held annually since 1975, with the winners originally determined using Gallup Polls until a switch to online voting in 2005. The awards were created by Bob Stivers, who produced the first show in 1975. The first awards recognized The Sting as Favorite Picture of 1974, Barbra Streisand as the year's Favorite Film Actress, and John Wayne as its Favorite Film Actor. So far, Ellen DeGeneres and Taylor Swift are the most awarded people, with a total of 20 awards each. In 1982, Stivers sold the People's Choice Awards to Procter & Gamble Productions (P&G); under P&G, the ceremony was broadcast by CBS, and Procter & Gamble's brands held exclusive national advertising time across the entire telecast. In April 2017, the E! network announced that they had acquired the People's Choice Awards. The ceremony was shifted from its previous January scheduling to November, to reduce its proximity to the busier months of awards season. Since 2021, the ceremony has aired on E!'s sister broadcast network NBC. In March 2023, NBC announced that it would premiere a country music awards show—the People's Choice Country Awards—as a spin-off event; it will be held in September at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. In June 2023, it was announced that the People's Choice Awards would move to February, beginning with the 49th ceremony in 2024. In addition, the ceremony will stream live on Peacock in addition to the NBC and E! broadcasts.
