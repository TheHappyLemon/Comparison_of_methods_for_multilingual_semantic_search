Alexander Nikolayevich Zaitsev (June 15, 1935 â€“ October 31, 1971) was a leading Soviet chess grandmaster. He was born in Vladivostok, Russia. Perhaps his finest achievement was a share of first place at the 1968 USSR Chess Championship in Alma Ata. He eventually took the silver medal after losing the play-off to co-winner Lev Polugaevsky. The Chessmetrics website, which provides estimated ratings and rankings for players, places him as 21st in the world in 1969. Zaitsev had been born with a clubfoot. In 1971, he had an operation to correct the problem. Details are hard to come by, but Zaitsev died of complications from the surgery.
