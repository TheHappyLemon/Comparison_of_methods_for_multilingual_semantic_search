Closure is the first video album by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released on November 25, 1997. The double VHS set consists of one tape of live concert and behind-the-scenes footage from their Self-Destruct and Further Down the Spiral tours and one tape of music videos. The first cassette's footage highlights tour footage and backstage antics by Nine Inch Nails and their tour guests: Marilyn Manson, Jim Rose Circus and David Bowie. One segment, in particular, is dedicated to Reznor's penchant at the time for violently destroying keyboards and other tour equipment each show, which was Directed by Jonathan Rach. The music videos on the second cassette are interspersed with snippets from educational films, as well as exclusive footage shot by Peter Christopherson which is reminiscent of the video for "Closer"; these segments include remixed music from the band's back catalogue, most prominently featuring "A Warm Place" and "The Art of Self Destruction, Final". Closure also contains snippets of the non-commercially released Broken film. Footage from the Edison Manufacturing Company film Electrocuting an Elephant is shown before "March of the Pigs". According to Russell Mills, who created the artwork, a live album was also planned as a companion to Closure and artwork was made for it, but the idea was scrapped.
