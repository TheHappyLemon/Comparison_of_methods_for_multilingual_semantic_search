Twixt is a 2011 American horror film written, produced, and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It stars Val Kilmer, Bruce Dern, Elle Fanning, Ben Chaplin, Alden Ehrenreich, David Paymer, Joanne Whalley and Tom Waits. The film follows a struggling novelist (Kilmer) who stumbles upon a murder mystery in a small town, in the process entering an alternative, dream world. The film's title refers to the two worlds explored in the film, the dream and the waking worlds. The film premiered on September 4, 2011 at the Toronto International Film Festival and was screened at various film festivals in North America, receiving a limited theatrical release in a handful of international markets. It received a generally negative reception from critics, though several reviews were more positive, and Cahiers du cin√©ma placed it as the third best film of 2012. Twixt was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Fox Home Entertainment on July 23, 2013. A re-edited director's cut, entitled B'Twixt Now and Sunrise, was released theatrically on September 30, 2022, and on Blu-ray and digital on February 28, 2023.
