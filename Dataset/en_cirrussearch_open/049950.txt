The 2019–20 Serie A (known as the Serie A TIM for sponsorship reasons) was the 118th season of top-tier Italian football, the 88th in a round-robin tournament, and the 10th since its organization under an own league committee, the Lega Serie A. Juventus were the eight-time defending champions and they successfully defended their title following a 2–0 win against Sampdoria on 26 July 2020. The season was originally scheduled to run from 24 August 2019 to 24 May 2020. However, on 9 March 2020, the Italian government halted the league until 3 April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Serie A did not resume play on this date, citing it would only resume once "health conditions allow it". On 18 May, it was announced that Italian football would be suspended until 14 June. On 28 May, it was announced that Serie A would resume starting 20 June.
