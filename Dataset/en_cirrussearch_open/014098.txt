The 1978 NHL Amateur Draft was the 16th NHL Entry Draft. It was hosted at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Quebec, on June 15, 1978. It was the last draft to be called the "Amateur Draft" before the process was renamed to the NHL Entry Draft in 1979. The last active player in the NHL from this draft class was Viacheslav Fetisov, who retired after the 1997â€“98 season, although he was re-drafted in 1983.
