The Tallinn–Narva railway (Estonian: Tallinna–Narva raudtee) is a 211 km (131 mi) long railway line in Estonia which runs through Northern Estonia between Estonia's capital city Tallinn and the city of Narva on the border with Russia. The 1,520 mm (4 ft 11+27⁄32 in) Russian gauge railway line is double track between Tallinn and Tapa and single track between Tapa and Narva. It is the oldest railway in Estonia, and was opened in 1870 when a railway line connecting Saint Petersburg with Paldiski via Tallinn was opened. A significant part of the railway load consists of freight trains (such as oil trains) from Russia to the ports of Tallinn and its immediate vicinity (Muuga, Tallinn and Paldiski Harbor).
