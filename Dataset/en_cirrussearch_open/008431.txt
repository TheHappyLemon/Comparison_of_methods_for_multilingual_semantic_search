The 1963 FIBA World Championship was the 4th FIBA World Championship, the international basketball world championship for men's national teams. The competition was hosted by Brazil from 12 to 25 May 1963. The Philippines was originally awarded the right to host the tournament, but FIBA rescinded this after the Filipino immigration officials refused to grant visas to players from communist countries. Brazil, the defending champion and a previous host, re-host the championship from 12 to 25 May 1963, and won the first back to back title with just six games, seeding the well-rested host team in the final round only.
