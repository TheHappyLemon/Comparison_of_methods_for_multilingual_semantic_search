Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe type of muscular dystrophy predominantly affecting boys. The onset of muscle weakness typically begins around age four, with rapid progression. Initially, muscle loss occurs in the thighs and pelvis, extending to the arms, which can lead to difficulties in standing up. By the age of 12, most individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are unable walk. Affected muscles may appear larger due to an increase in fat content, and scoliosis is common. Some individuals may experience intellectual disability, and females carrying a single copy of the mutated gene may show mild symptoms. The disorder follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, with approximately two-thirds of cases inherited from the mother and one-third resulting from a new mutation. The cause is a mutation in the gene encoding the dystrophin protein, essential for maintaining the muscle fiber's cell membrane integrity. Diagnosis can frequently be made at birth through genetic testing, and elevated creatine kinase levels in the blood are indicative of the condition. While there is no known cure, management strategies such as physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may alleviate symptoms. Assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles. Medication options include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants for seizure and muscle activity control, and immunosuppressants to delay muscle cell damage. Gene therapy is in the early stages of study in humans, with preliminary results showing potential for improved muscle strength, though long-term outcomes remain unknown as of 2020[update]. Various figures of the occurrence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy are reported. One source reports that it affects about one in 3,500 to 6,000 males at birth. Another source reports Duchenne muscular dystrophy being a rare disease and having an occurrence of 7.1 per 100,000 male births. A number of sources referenced in this article indicate an occurrence of 6 per 100,000. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common type of muscular dystrophy, with a median life expectancy of 28â€“30 years. However, with comprehensive care, some individuals may live into their 30s or 40s. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is considerably rarer in females, occurring in approximately one in 50,000,000 live female births.
