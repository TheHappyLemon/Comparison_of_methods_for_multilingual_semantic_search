Klinefelter syndrome (KS), also known as 47,XXY, is an aneuploid genetic condition where the recipient has an additional copy of the X chromosome. As the presence of a Y chromosome denotes male sex, people with Klinefelter syndrome are still genetically male, although they occasionally suffer health complications. These complications commonly include infertility and small, poorly functioning testicles (if present). These symptoms are often noticed only at puberty, although this is one of the most common chromosomal disorders, occurring in one to two per 1,000 live births. It is named after American endocrinologist Harry Klinefelter, who identified the condition in the 1940s. The syndrome is defined by the presence of at least one extra X chromosome in addition to a Y chromosome yielding a total of 47 or more chromosomes rather than the usual 46. Klinefelter syndrome occurs randomly. The extra X chromosome comes from the father and mother nearly equally. An older mother may have a slightly increased risk of a child with KS. The syndrome is diagnosed by the genetic test known as a karyotype.
