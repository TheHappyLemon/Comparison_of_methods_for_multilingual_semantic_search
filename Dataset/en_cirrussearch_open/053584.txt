The Vienna Woods (German: Wienerwald, pronounced [ˈviːnɐˌvalt] ) are forested highlands that form the northeastern foothills of the Northern Limestone Alps in the states of Lower Austria and Vienna. The 45-kilometre-long (28 mi) and 20–30-kilometre-wide (12–19 mi) range of hills is heavily wooded and a popular recreation area with the Viennese.
