Atlantis is a fictional starship and city in the Stargate television franchise. It is the primary setting of the television series Stargate Atlantis (2004-2009), and it has been depicted in Stargate SG-1 as well as various spin-off fiction and products. In the show, Atlantis was constructed millions of years ago by the Ancients, who eventually abandoned the city in the distant Pegasus Galaxy. In 2004, after SG-1 uncover the location of the city, Elizabeth Weir led a civilian and military expedition, setting up a base of operation in the city. The shows production designer Bridget McGuire oversaw the interior set design of Atlantis, with James Robbins adding to it after taking over the role in the third season of Stargate Atlantis. McGuire and Robbins also worked on the exterior look of the city, collaborating with, amongst others, visual effects supervisor John Gajdecki and concept artist Chris Wren.
