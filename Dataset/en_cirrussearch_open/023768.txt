Kadiivka (Ukrainian: Кадіївка) or Stakhanov (Russian: Стаханов), is a city in Alchevsk Raion, Luhansk Oblast, Donbas, eastern Ukraine. It is located on the Komyshuvakha River, a right tributary of the Luhan. Ukraine renamed the city Kadiivka in 2016, and refers to the city by this name, however Ukraine has not controlled the city since early 2014. Following their 2022 annexation referendum, Russia claimed the entire Luhansk Oblast, including Stakhanov (Kadiivka), as part of their Lugansk People's Republic (LPR / LNR). Kadiivka's population is approximately 73,248 (2022 estimate). Russia maintains the name Stakhanov, after the famous Soviet miner Alexei Stakhanov, and all city signage remains in the name of Stakhanov.
