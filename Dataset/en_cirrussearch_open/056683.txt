Spanking is a form of corporal punishment involving the act of striking, with either the palm of the hand or an implement, the buttocks of a person to cause physical pain. The term spanking broadly encompasses the use of either the hand or implement, the use of implements can also refer to the administration of more specific types of corporal punishment such as caning, paddling and slippering. Some parents spank children in response to undesired behavior. Adults more commonly spank boys than girls both at home and in school. Some countries have outlawed the spanking of children in every setting, including homes, schools, and penal institutions, while others permit it when done by a parent or guardian.
