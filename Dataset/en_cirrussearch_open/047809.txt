The coat of arms of Moldova is the national emblem of the Republic of Moldova. The escutscheon's aurochs head accompanied by a rose, crescent and pointed star is derived from the coat of arms of the Principality of Moldavia. The heraldic supporter of an eagle with a cross in the beak is derived from the interwar coat of arms of the Kingdom of Romania. Most of Moldova's territory was part of Romania between World War I and World War II.
