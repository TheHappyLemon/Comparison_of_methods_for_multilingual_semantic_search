Austria competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. The nation has competed at every edition of Summer Olympic Games, except the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The Österreichisches Olympisches Comité sent a total of 70 athletes to the Games, 39 men and 31 women, to compete in 17 sports. This was approximately the same size as the previous Games, with the difference of one male athlete, the addition of one female athlete and three sporting events participated in. There was only a single competitor in eventing, fencing, rhythmic gymnastics, modern pentathlon, and Greco-Roman wrestling. The Austrian team included past Olympic medalists: judoka Ludwig Paischer, who won silver in Beijing, and swimmer Markus Rogan, who was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. Rifle shooter and multiple time world champion Thomas Farnik, at age 45, competed at his sixth Olympics and was the oldest and most experienced team member. Meanwhile, two Austrian athletes made their fifth Olympic appearance: table tennis player and former world champion Werner Schlager, and slalom kayaker Helmut Oblinger, the husband of former Olympic bronze medalist Violetta Oblinger-Peters. Austria, however, failed to win a single medal for the first time in since 1964, after achieving poor performance at these games. Hurdler Beate Schrott, butterfly swimmer Dinko Jukic, open skiff sailors Nico Delle Karth and Nikolaus Resch, sprint kayak pair Yvonne Schuring and Viktoria Schwarz, and modern pentathlete Thomas Daniel qualified successfully for the final rounds of their respective sports, but missed out of the medal standings.
