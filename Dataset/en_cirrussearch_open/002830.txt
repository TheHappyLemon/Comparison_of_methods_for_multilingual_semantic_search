Sergio Germán Romero (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈseɾxjo xeɾˈman roˈmeɾo]; born 22 February 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Boca Juniors. Romero made his debut with Racing Club in the Argentine Primera División in 2007 and then transferred to Dutch club AZ Alkmaar at the end of the season. He won the Eredivisie in 2009, and two years later joined Italian side Sampdoria. In 2013, Romero joined Monaco on a season-long loan. He signed for Manchester United in July 2015, largely serving as backup to David de Gea but playing in a series of important matches for the club. Romero was the starting goalkeeper through Manchester United's 2016-17 UEFA Europa League run, playing in the Final and keeping a clean sheet as the club defeated Ajax to win a fifth major European trophy in their history. He made 61 appearances for United across six seasons in total, later returning to Argentina with Boca Juniors in 2022, where he won the Argentine Primera División. Romero is the most capped goalkeeper in the history of the Argentina national team, playing over 90 times since his debut in 2009. He has represented Argentina at two World Cups and at three Copa América tournaments, finishing as runner-up in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, as well as in the 2015 and 2016 Copa América tournaments. He also was part of the team that won gold at the 2008 Olympics.
