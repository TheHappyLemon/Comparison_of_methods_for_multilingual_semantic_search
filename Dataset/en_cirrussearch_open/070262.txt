Death in Paradise is a British–French crime comedy drama television series created by Robert Thorogood, starring Ben Miller (series 1–3), Kris Marshall (series 3–6), Ardal O'Hanlon (series 6–9) and Ralf Little (series 9–13). The programme is filmed on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe and is broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom, France 2 in France, PBS, Ovation and Britbox in the United States and Canada, Prime in New Zealand (with repeats on BBC UKTV), and on Foxtel's "BBC First" channel, ABC and 9Gem in Australia. Death in Paradise has enjoyed high viewing figures and a generally positive critical reception since its debut, leading to repeated renewals. The most recent series, series 13, began broadcasting in the UK on 4 February 2024 and ended on 24 March. The show is currently commissioned for one more series, ensuring the programme will run until at least 2025.

A second spin-off called Return to Paradise for ABC television in Australia and BBC One, was announced in November 2023.
