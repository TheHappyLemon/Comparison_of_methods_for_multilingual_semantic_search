Marijos Apsilankymo katedra) also called Vilkaviškis Cathedral is a religious building of the Catholic Church that serves as the cathedral of Vilkaviškis, Lithuania, and is the seat of the Diocese of Vilkaviškis. The church was built in Romanesque style, between 1870 and 1881 and was consecrated in 1884. With the erection of the Diocese of Vilkaviškis in 1926, the church was elevated to the rank of cathedral.
