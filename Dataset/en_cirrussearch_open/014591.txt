Growing to 1 metre (3+1⁄2 feet) tall, it is characterized by small whitish flowers, a tall stem of fernlike leaves, and a pungent odor. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Asia, Europe, and North America. It has been introduced as a feed for livestock in New Zealand and Australia. Used by some animals, the plant may have somewhat toxic properties, although historically it has been employed for medicinal purposes.
