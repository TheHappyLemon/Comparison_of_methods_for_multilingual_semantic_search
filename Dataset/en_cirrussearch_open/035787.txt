The 30th Chess Olympiad (Tagalog: Ika-30 Olimpiyadang pang-ahedres), organized by FIDE and comprising an open and a women's tournament, as well as several other events designed to promote the game of chess, took place between June 7 and June 25, 1992, at the Philippine International Convention Center in Manila, Philippines. Following the fall of the Iron Curtain, the field of competitors was quite different from previous Olympiads. Twelve of the 15 former Soviet republics now competed as independent nations, and they all finished in the top half. Meanwhile, an all-German team was present for the first time since World War II. Of the former Yugoslav republics, Croatia, Bosnia, and Slovenia appeared independently; Serbia-Montenegro and Macedonia did not. This Olympiad also marked the final appearance of Czechoslovakia and the re-appearance of South Africa. With the Soviet team a thing of the past, all three medal ranks were now occupied by different ex-Soviet teams. Russia, captained by world champion Kasparov, took up the illustrious legacy of their predecessor and won by four points. Uzbekistan's silver was a small surprise; the Armenian bronze less so.
