The EuroBasket 2022 was the 41st edition of the EuroBasket championship organized by FIBA Europe. It was the first since it was agreed it would take place every four years, with a similar system of qualification as for the FIBA Basketball World Cup. It was originally scheduled to take place between 2 and 19 September 2021, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics to 2021, it was postponed to September 2022. Like the previous two editions, the tournament was co-hosted by four countries. Games in the group stage were held in the Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, and Italy. The knock-out phase was played in Berlin, Germany. The tournament featured three All-NBA First Team members, Nikola Jokić (Serbia), Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece) and Luka Dončić (Slovenia), making it one of the most anticipated tournaments in EuroBasket history. Spain won the final against France, achieving its fourth EuroBasket title in the last six tournaments. Germany secured the bronze medal on home soil after defeating Poland.
