The Uber Arena, previously known under several other names, is a multipurpose indoor arena in the Friedrichshain neighborhood of Berlin, Germany, which opened in 2008. The arena became known as Uber Arena following a long-term deal with venue operators AEG Europe in 2024. With a capacity of 17,000 people, it is home to the Eisbären Berlin ice hockey club and the Alba Berlin basketball team, and is used for other ice hockey, basketball and handball matches as well as concerts. The arena hosted the 2008–09 Euroleague Final Four, European professional basketball club competition. The arena was one of the most prominent elements of the Mediaspree urban redevelopment project, quickly gaining emblematic status in the debates surrounding the project's impact. The arena hosted the 2022 Premier League Darts final on 13 June 2022.
