Sven Tumba (born Sven Olof Gunnar Johansson; 28 August 1931 â€“ 1 October 2011) was one of the most prominent Swedish ice hockey players of the 1950s and 1960s. He also represented Sweden in football as well as golf and became Swedish champion in waterskiing. Johansson first became known as "Tumba" in the 1950s since there were other players with the same last name, and he grew up in the Swedish town of Tumba. In October 1960 he married his wife Mona, and five years later he, along with Mona, legally changed his family name to Tumba. Johansson was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1997. After his retirement from ice hockey, he became an accomplished golfer, a golf course designer, creator and organizer of golf exhibitions and tournaments, as well as an ambassador for the game of golf, even officially introducing the game of golf to the former Soviet Union.
