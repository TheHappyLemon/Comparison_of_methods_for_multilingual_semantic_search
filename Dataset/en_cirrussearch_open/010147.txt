Traditional Russian units of measurement were standardized and used in Imperial Russia and after the Russian Revolution, but were abandoned after 21 July 1925, when the Soviet Union adopted the metric system, per the order of the Council of People's Commissars. The Tatar system is very similar to the Russian one, but some names are different.[citation needed] The Polish system is also very close to the Russian. The system existed since Kievan Rus', but under Peter the Great, the Russian units were redefined relative to the English system. Until Peter the Great the system also used Cyrillic numerals, and only in the 18th century did Peter the Great replace it with the Hinduâ€“Arabic numeral system.
