On 1 July 2009 the former districts of Latvia were divided into 109 municipalities (Latvian: novadi, sg. novads), and nine republic cities (Latvian: republikas pilsētas, sg. republikas pilsēta) with their own city council and administration. In 2010, acting upon the request of the local populace, Mērsrags Municipality was split off from Roja Municipality, bringing the total to 110 municipalities. The previous administrative reform had been enacted in 1990 upon the restoration of the independence of Latvia. For the current administrative divisions since 1st of July 2021, see Administrative divisions of Latvia.
