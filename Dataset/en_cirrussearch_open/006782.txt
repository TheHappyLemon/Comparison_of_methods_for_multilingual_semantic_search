Vennaskond (Estonian for Brotherhood) is an Estonian punk rock band founded in 1984. The band has toured in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Romania, Sweden, Germany, France, India, Poland and the United States (including CBGB). To show respect to the band, Metallica covered Vennaskond's hit song Insener Garini hüperboloid (Engineer Garin's Hyperboloid) in Estonia in front of a 60 000 strong crowd during their gig in Tartu, Estonia on 18 July 2019. The band is explicitly anarchist, with many lyrics referring to historical anarchists. The frontman of the band, Tõnu Trubetsky, has been called "Estonia's leading anarchist".
