Goodison Park is a football stadium in the Walton area of Liverpool, England, 2 miles (3 km) north of the city centre. It has been the home of Premier League club Everton since 1892 and has an all-seated capacity of 39,414. Goodison Park has hosted more top-flight games than any other stadium in England. It has also been the venue for an FA Cup Final and numerous international fixtures, including a semi-final match in the 1966 World Cup. Initially, Everton planned to leave Goodison Park and relocate to the new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock in 2024, but they now have decided to leave their home at the end of the 2024–25 season, when the Goodison Park site will be redeveloped.
