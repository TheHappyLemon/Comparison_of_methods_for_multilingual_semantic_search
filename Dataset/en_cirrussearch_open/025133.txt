The Garonne (/ɡəˈrɒn, ɡæˈ-/, also US: /ɡɑːˈrɔːn/, French: [ɡaʁɔn]; Occitan, Catalan, Basque, and Spanish: Garona, Occitan pronunciation: [ɡaˈrunɔ]; Latin: Garumna or Garunna) is a river that flows in southwest France and northern Spain. It flows from the central Spanish Pyrenees to the Gironde estuary at the French port of Bordeaux – a length of 529 km (329 mi), of which 47 km (29 mi) is in Spain (Val d'Aran); the total length extends to 602 km (374 mi) if one includes the Gironde estuary between the river and the sea. Its basin area is 56,000 km2 (22,000 sq mi), which increases to 84,811 km2 (32,746 sq mi) if the Dordogne River, which flows from the east and joins the Garonne at Bec d'Ambès to form the Gironde estuary, is included. Umayyad and Aquitanian forces fought the Battle of the River Garonne in 732 beside the river near present-day Bordeaux.
