Cyborgs: Heroes Never Die (Ukrainian: Кiборги: Герої не вмирають; Romanized: Kiborhy: Heroyi ne vmyrayut) is a 2017 Ukrainian war drama film about the Cyborgs, the Ukrainian defenders in the Second Battle of Donetsk Airport during the war in Donbas. The film was written by Nataliya Vorozhbyt, directed by Akhtem Seitablayev and produced by Ivanna Diadiura. Based on a national patriotic myth and released on the second anniversary of the fall of the airport's old terminal, Cyborgs had the highest-grossing opening weekend for a Ukrainian film at that time. Funded chiefly by the Ukrainian State Film Agency and filmed with assistance from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the film is not propaganda as it portrays the Ukrainian fighters performing both heroic and antiheroic actions. The film received six Golden Dzygas at the 2018 Ukrainian National Film Awards.
