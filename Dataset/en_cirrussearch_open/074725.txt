SketchUp is 3D modeling software that allows users to create and manipulate 3D models of buildings, landscapes, furniture, and other objects. It is commonly used in architecture and interior design. SketchUp is owned by Trimble Inc. The program is currently available as a web-based application, SketchUp Free, and three paid subscriptions, SketchUp Shop, SketchUp Pro, and SketchUp Studio, each with increasing functionality. The program includes drawing layout functionality, surface rendering in different "styles", and enables placement of its models within Google Earth.
