Malacca Strait is a narrow stretch of water, 500 mi (800 km) long and from 40 to 155 mi (65â€“250 km) wide, located between the Indonesian island of Sumatra to the southwest and the Malay Peninsula (Peninsular Malaysia) to the northeast, connecting the Andaman Sea (Indian Ocean) with the Singapore Strait and the South China Sea (Pacific Ocean). As the main shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, it is one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. It is named after the Phyllanthus emblica, which is known by the locals as the Malaka tree, grown in coastal regions alongside the strait.
