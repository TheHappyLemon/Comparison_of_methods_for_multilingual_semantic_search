The 2024 United States presidential election will be the 60th quadrennial presidential election, set to be held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. Voters will elect a president and vice president for a term of four years. Incumbent President Joe Biden, a member of the Democratic Party, is running for re-election. His predecessor Donald Trump, a member of the Republican Party, is running for re-election for a second, non-consecutive term. This will mark the seventh presidential rematch in American history and the first since 1956. If Trump wins, he would become the second president to serve a non-consecutive term, the first being Grover Cleveland. The winner of this election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. It will occur at the same time as elections relating to the U.S. Senate, House, gubernatorial, and state legislative. On March 12, Biden and Trump became the presumptive nominees for the Democratic and Republican parties respectively by clinching a majority of delegates, although they have yet to be confirmed at the nominating conventions. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. emerged as the highest-polling third-party presidential candidate since Ross Perot in the 1992 and 1996 elections, running as an independent. Abortion, immigration, healthcare, education, the economy, foreign policy, border security, LGBT rights, climate change, and democracy are expected to be leading campaign issues.
