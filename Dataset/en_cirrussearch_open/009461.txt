The Senegal national football team (French: Équipe de football du Senegal), nicknamed Les Lions de la Teranga (meaning: The Lions of Teranga), represents Senegal in international association football and is operated by the Senegalese Football Federation. They are the current champions of the African Nations Championship. One of Africa's most famous national football teams, Senegal reached the quarter-finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the second team from Africa to do so (after Cameroon in 1990). They managed to upset defending world champions France, finish second in their group, and beat Sweden in extra time in the round of 16, before losing to Turkey in the quarter-finals. Senegal's first appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations was in 1965, when they lost 1–0 to Ivory Coast for fourth place. They hosted the 1992 African Cup of Nations, where they made it to the quarter-finals, and finished as runners-up in both 2002 and 2019. Senegal would finally win their first AFCON title in 2021, defeating Egypt in the final on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time. Along with Norway, Senegal is one of very few national football teams never to have lost against Brazil, having one win and one draw in friendly matches.
