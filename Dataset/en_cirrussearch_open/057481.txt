Lake Achen (German: Achensee) is a lake in Austria, north of Jenbach in Tyrol. Lake Achen is also called "Fjord of the Alps" and "Tyrolean Sea". The largest lake within the federal state, its maximum depth is 133 metres (436 ft). Together with the Achen Valley, it parts the Karwendel mountain range in the west from the Brandenberg Alps in the east. Water quality is near that of drinking water, with sight up to ten metres (33 ft) below the surface. An alpine lake, water temperature is accordingly low, rarely above 20 °C (68 °F). Its size and wind conditions make it suitable for windsurfing. Eben am Achensee, Achenkirch, and Pertisau are municipalities on the lake. The Achensee and its hinterland serves as the model for the 'Tiernsee', setting of the Chalet School series of children's books by Elinor M. Brent-Dyer.
