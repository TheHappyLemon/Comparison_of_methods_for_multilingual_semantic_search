The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR; Ilocano: Rehion/Deppaar Administratibo ti Kordiliera; Filipino: Rehiyong Pampangasiwaan ng Cordillera), also known as the Cordillera Region and Cordillera (IPA: [kɔrdiljɛra]), is an administrative region in the Philippines, situated within the island of Luzon. It is the only landlocked region in the insular country, bordered by the Ilocos Region to the west and southwest, and by the Cagayan Valley Region to the north, east, and southeast. It is the least populous region in the Philippines, with a population less than that of the city of Manila. The region comprises six provinces: Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mountain Province. The regional center is the highly urbanized city of Baguio. The region was officially created on July 15, 1987, and covers most of the Cordillera Mountain Range of Luzon and is home to numerous ethnic peoples. The Nueva Vizcaya province has a majority of Igorot population, but was placed by the American colonial government in the Cagayan Valley Region instead during the early 20th century, so do Quirino. According to the 2020 Census of Population and Housing, this region is the least populated region in the Philippines.
