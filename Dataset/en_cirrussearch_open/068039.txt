When Bobby learns that his father is dying, he travels to his family home in Washington to visit him, taking along his uncouth girlfriend. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards, and in 2000, was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and recommended for preservation.
