A Kid Named Cudi is the debut mixtape by American rapper Kid Cudi, released on July 17, 2008, by New York City streetwear brand 10.Deep, in conjunction with independent record label Fool's Gold Records. Considered his breakout project, the mixtape marked Cudi's first official release, issued prior to his debut album Man on the Moon: The End of Day (2009). Production was handled by Plain Pat and Emile; samples range from Outkast to Paul Simon and N.E.R.D to Band of Horses. The mixtape allowed a new progression of Kid Cudi with the release catching the ear of Kanye West, founder of GOOD Music, whom Cudi would ultimately be signed to later that year. Notably, the album contains the song "Day 'n' Nite", Kid Cudi's commercial debut single, which reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The mixtape received favorable reviews from music critics, and is also largely credited with establishing Cudi's fan base. Cudi reissued a re-mastered version of A Kid Named Cudi, 14 years after its original release, on July 15, 2022, via Republic Records. The mixtape was reissued following Cudi's first greatest hits album The Boy Who Flew to the Moon, Vol. 1 (2022) and prior to his eighth solo album Entergalactic (2022), also preceding his 2022 global concert tour To the Moon.
