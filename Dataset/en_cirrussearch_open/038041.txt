This is a list consisting of all the heads of government of modern and contemporary Romania (i.e. prime ministers, both in full constitutional powers and acting or ad interim), since the establishment of the United Principalities in 1859 to the present day. The incumbent prime minister of Romania, as of 1 April 2024, is Ion-Marcel Ciolacu, the current leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), who has been serving since 15 June 2023 onwards. Ciolacu has been leading a PSD-PNL grand coalition government, as part of and representing the ruling National Coalition for Romania (CNR), since mid June 2023 to the present day. The Ciolacu Cabinet is the second CNR government to date and the only one to be composed of only two major political parties, after the UDMR/RMDSZ was eliminated from the coalition and, consequently, entered in opposition. In addition, the share of governmental power between the two major political parties which constitute this CNR cabinet is equal (i.e. 11 ministries per each constituent political party). For some time however, the stability and cohesion of the incumbent cabinet are both quite debatable.
