The Church of Our Lady of Victories at the Sablon (French: Église Notre-Dame des Victoires au Sablon; Dutch: Onze-Lieve-Vrouw ter Zege op de Zavelkerk), or the Church of Our Lady of the Sablon (French: Église Notre-Dame du Sablon; Dutch: Onze-Lieve-Vrouw ter Zavelkerk), is a Roman Catholic church located in the Sablon/Zavel district, in the historic centre of Brussels, Belgium. It is dedicated to Our Lady of the Sablon. Built in the 15th century, the church was patronised by the nobility and wealthy citizens of Brussels, and is characterised by its late Brabantine Gothic exterior and rich interior decoration including two Baroque chapels. Its neo-Gothic decorative elements date from the 19th century. The complex was designated a historic monument in 1936. The church is located along the Rue de la Régence/Regentschapsstraat, halfway between the Place Royale/Koningsplein and the Palace of Justice, not far for the Royal Museums of Fine Arts and across the street from the Square du Petit Sablon/Kleine Zavelsquare. This site is served by the tram stop Petit Sablon/Kleine Zavel (on lines 92 and 93).
