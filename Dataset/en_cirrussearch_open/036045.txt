"Nina, Pretty Ballerina" is a song recorded in November 1972 by Swedish pop group ABBA, and released on 7" vinyl record in Austria and France in October 1973 as the seventh and final single from the band's debut album Ring Ring. It reached #8 on the singles chart in Austria. The song was also the theme song of Sirius talk-show host Lynn Samuels. Lynn Samuels only played "Nina, Ballerina," as she called it, on Friday, to reward herself for working all week, when she was on Sirius Radio in New York.
