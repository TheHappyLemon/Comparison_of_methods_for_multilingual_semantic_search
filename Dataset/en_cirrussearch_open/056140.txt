Nuuk Cathedral (Greenlandic: Annaassisitta Oqaluffia) or Church of Our Saviour (Danish: Vor Frelser Kirke) is a wooden Lutheran cathedral in the Old Nuuk neighborhood of Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. It was established in 1849. The red building with its spire is a prominent site on the landscape. During National Day celebrations, large crowds usually gather around the church.
