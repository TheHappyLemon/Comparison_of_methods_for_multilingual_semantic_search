Chinland, officially the State of Chinland, is a self-governing polity in Southeast Asia. Its claimed territory encompasses Myanmar's Chin State. It controls nearly all of the Chin State in western Myanmar, along the borders with Bangladesh and India. The Chinland Council, the ruling authority of Chinland, stated that one of its main goals is the formation of federal union, where Chinland will become an autonomous federal unit within a future federal Myanmar once the State Administration Council military junta has been overthrown.
