The Ukrainian State (Ukrainian: Українська Держава, romanized: Ukrainska Derzhava), sometimes also called the Second Hetmanate (Ukrainian: Другий Гетьманат, romanized: Druhyi Hetmanat), was an anti-Bolshevik government that existed on most of the modern territory of Ukraine (except for Western Ukraine) from 29 April to 14 December 1918. It was installed by German military authorities after the socialist-leaning Central Council of the Ukrainian People's Republic was dispersed on 28 April 1918. The Ukrainian State was governed by Pavlo Skoropadskyi, the hetman of all Ukraine, who outlawed all socialist-oriented political parties, creating an anti-Bolshevik front with the Russian State. It collapsed in December 1918, when Skoropadskyi was deposed and the Ukrainian People's Republic returned to power in the form of the Directorate.
