The King's Man is a 2021 British-American spy action film directed by Matthew Vaughn from his story and a screenplay he wrote with Karl Gajdusek. The third installment in the British Kingsman film series, which is based on the comic book The Secret Service (later retitled to Kingsman) by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, in-turn based on a concept by Millar and Vaughn, it is a prequel to Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) and Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017). Its ensemble cast includes Ralph Fiennes (also one of its executive producers), Gemma Arterton, Rhys Ifans, Matthew Goode, Tom Hollander, Harris Dickinson, Daniel Br√ºhl, Djimon Hounsou, and Charles Dance. It focuses on several events during World War I and the birth of the Kingsman organization. It was released in the United States on 22 December 2021, and in the United Kingdom on 26 December 2021 by 20th Century Studios following several release delays partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It received mixed reviews from critics, grossing $126 million against nearly a $100 million budget, making it a box-office bomb. A direct sequel, titled The King's Man: The Traitor King, is currently in development.
