The State of Aleppo (French: État d'Alep; Arabic: دولة حلب Dawlat Ḥalab) was one of the six states that were established by the French High Commissioner of the Levant, General Henri Gouraud, in the French Mandate of Syria which followed the San Remo conference and the collapse of King Faisal I's short-lived Arab monarchy in Syria. The other states were the State of Damascus (1920), the Alawite State (1920), the State of Jabal Druze (1921), the Sanjak of Alexandretta (1921), as well as the State of Greater Lebanon (1920), which later became the modern country of Lebanon.
