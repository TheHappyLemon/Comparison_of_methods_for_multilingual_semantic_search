Sergei Leonidovich Tikhanovsky (Russian: Серге́й Леони́дович Тихано́вский), also transliterated as Syarhey Leanidavich Tsikhanouski (Belarusian: Сярге́й Леані́давіч Ціхано́ўскі; born 18 August 1978), is a Belarusian YouTuber, video blogger, dissident and pro-democracy activist. He is considered by Amnesty International to be a prisoner of conscience. He is known primarily for his activism against the government of Belarus's long-serving president, Alexander Lukashenko. In May 2020, he announced his intention of running for the 2020 presidential election, but he was arrested two days after the announcement, and his wife Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya then ran in place of him as the main rival to Lukashenko in the contested election.
