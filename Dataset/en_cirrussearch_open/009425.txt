The Algeria national football team (Arabic: منتخب الْجَزَائِر لِكُرَّةُ الْقَدَم) represents Algeria in men's international football, and is governed by the Algerian Football Federation. The team plays their home matches at the 5 July Stadium in Algiers and Miloud Hadefi Stadium in Oran. Algeria joined FIFA on 1 January 1964, a year and a half after gaining independence. They are the current champions of the FIFA Arab Cup. The North African team has qualified for four World Cups in 1982, 1986, 2010 and 2014. Algeria has won the Africa Cup of Nations twice, once in 1990, when they hosted the tournament, and again in Egypt in 2019. They were also champions of the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup, the 1991 Afro-Asian Cup of Nations, the men's football tournament of the 1978 All-Africa Games and the men's football tournament of the 1975 Mediterranean Games. The traditional rivals of Algeria are mainly: Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. Algeria has also had very competitive matches against Nigeria, especially in the 1980s during Algeria's best football generation, against Mali due to sharing a common border and a long-standing competitive rivalry, and against Senegal, where Algeria's first global success began. For the Algerians, their biggest victory on the world stage was their 2–1 win against West Germany during the 1982 FIFA World Cup in which the African nation shocked the world. Algeria has produced many talented players throughout its history and is considered one of the best teams in African football history. At the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Algeria became the first African team to score at least four goals in a match at a World Cup, which was against South Korea.
