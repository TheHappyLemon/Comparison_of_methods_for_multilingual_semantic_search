The Cuba national football team (Spanish: Selección de fútbol de Cuba) represents Cuba in men's international football, and is controlled by the Football Association of Cuba. Nicknamed Leones del Caribe (Lions of Caribbean), the team represents all three FIFA, Caribbean Football Union and Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF). They were the first Caribbean team to get to the World Cup Quarter finals – they did so in 1938. There, in the round of 16, they defeated Romania in a replay, 2–1, after drawing against them 3–3. They were then eliminated in the quarter-finals by Sweden, 8–0. Cuba has not returned to the World Cup since. Cuba finished second in the North American Nations Cup in 1947, which they hosted the tournament, second also in Caribbean Cup in 1996, 1999, and 2005, but won in 2012.
