Kaseya Center (/kəˈseɪ.ə/ kə-SAY-ə) is a multi-purpose arena on Biscayne Bay in Miami, Florida. The arena was previously named American Airlines Arena from opening in 1999 until 2021, FTX Arena from 2021 until 2023 following the bankruptcy of FTX, and Miami-Dade Arena during an interim period in 2023. Since April 2023, the naming rights to the arena are owned by Kaseya under a 17-year, $117.4 million agreement. The arena has capacity for 19,500 people, including 2,105 club seats, 80 luxury suites, and 76 private boxes. Additionally, for more intimate performances, The Waterfront Theater, the largest indoor theater in Florida, is within the arena complex, seating between 3,000 and 5,800 patrons. The theater can be configured for concerts, worship events, family events, musical theatre shows and other stage productions. American Airlines, which has a hub at Miami International Airport, maintains a travel center at the venue. The arena is directly served by the Miami Metrorail at Government Center station via free transfers to Metromover Omni Loop, providing direct service to Freedom Tower station and Park West station stations, within walking distance.
