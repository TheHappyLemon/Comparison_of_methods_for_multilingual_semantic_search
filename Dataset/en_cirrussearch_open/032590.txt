The so-called Molotov Line (Russian: Линия Молотова, Liniya Molotova) comprised a system of border fortified regions built in the Soviet Union in the years 1940–1941 along its new western borders. These border revisions resulted of the occupation of the Baltic States, Eastern Poland and Bessarabia in 1940.
