Per Tomas Brolin (born 29 November 1969) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a forward or as a midfielder. At club level, he had a successful period with A.C. Parma during the early 1990s, winning the 1992 Coppa Italia, the 1993 Cup Winners' Cup, the 1993 UEFA Super Cup, and the 1995 UEFA Cup. He also represented Näsvikens IK, GIF Sundsvall, IFK Norrköping, Leeds, FC Zürich, Crystal Palace and Hudiksvall ABK during a career that spanned between 1984 and 1998. A full international between 1990 and 1995, Brolin won 47 caps and scored 27 goals for the Sweden national team and helped them finish third at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He was also a member of the Sweden squads that competed at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1992, and 1992 Summer Olympics. He was the 1990 and 1994 recipient of Guldbollen as Sweden's best footballer of the year. 13 days before his 25th birthday in November 1994 he broke a bone in his foot leading to 5 months out of first team football. After returning from that injury he was unable to deliver the height of performance he had pre-injury. After struggles with form, injury and weight he retired as a footballer at the age of 28.
