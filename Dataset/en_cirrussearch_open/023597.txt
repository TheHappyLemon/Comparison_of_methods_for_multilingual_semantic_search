The Pskov Republic (Russian: Псковская Республика, romanized: Pskovskaya Respublika) was a medieval state in what is now northern Russia and Estonia. Originally a principality and then a part of the Novgorod Republic, Pskov became an independent republic in 1348. Its territory was roughly equivalent to modern-day Pskov Oblast. Its capital city was Pskov.
