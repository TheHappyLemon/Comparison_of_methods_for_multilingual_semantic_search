The Wilno school massacre was a school shooting that occurred on 6 May 1925 at the Joachim Lelewel High School in Wilno, Poland (now Vilnius, Lithuania). During the final exams, at about 11 a.m., at least two eighth-grade students attacked the board of examiners with revolvers and hand grenades, killing two students, one teacher, and themselves. It was the first-ever school shooting that took place in Poland, preceding the Inowrocław school shooting in April 1936, the Kluczbork School of Economics shooting on December 16, 2001 and the Brześć Kujawski school shooting on May 27, 2019.
