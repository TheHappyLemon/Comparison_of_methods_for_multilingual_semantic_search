Col du Grand Colombier (el. 1,498 metres or 4,915 feet) is a mountain pass in the Jura mountains in France. This pass lies at the southern extremity of the Jura in the massif of the Grand Colombier. With the Col du Chasseral, it is the highest road pass in the Jura. It passes between the Grand Colombier (el. 1,531 m (5,023 ft)) and the Croix du Colombier (1,525 m (5,003 ft)), which is accessible by trail from the pass. The view from the summit is superb, either down the valley of the Rhône, the Lac du Bourget and the gorges of Val-de-Fier, or the distant peaks of the Alps.
