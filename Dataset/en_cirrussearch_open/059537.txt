Kralendijk (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈkraːlə(n)dɛik]) is the capital city and main port of the island of Bonaire in the Caribbean Netherlands. The language spoken in the town is Papiamentu, but Dutch and English are widely used. As of 2017[update], the town had a population of 10,620. In Papiamentu, the town is often called Playa or "beach". Off the coast of Kralendijk lies the uninhabited island of Klein Bonaire, noted for diving and snorkeling activities. This small island can be reached by water taxi, or, for divers, by practically all of the local dive operators.
