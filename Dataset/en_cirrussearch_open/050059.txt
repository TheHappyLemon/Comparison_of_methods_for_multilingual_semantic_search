Pomors or Pomory (Russian: помо́ры, lit. 'seasiders', Russian pronunciation: [pɐˈmorɨ]) are an ethnographic group descended from Russian settlers, primarily from Veliky Novgorod, living on the White Sea coasts and the territory whose southern border lies on a watershed which separates the White Sea river basin from the basins of rivers that flow south.
