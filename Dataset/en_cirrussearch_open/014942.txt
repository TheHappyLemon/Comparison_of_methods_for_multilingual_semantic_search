Archival evidence suggests that 19,540 bodies lie here, 8,000 of whom were shot or died during the Great Terror. The cemetery is located near the rail station at Levashovo, Saint Petersburg, in an empty area referred to in Russian as the Levashovskaya Pustosh (Russian: Левашовская пустошь), the Levashovo Wasteland. Bodies dating back to the Terror were first found there in spring 1989 by a Memorial (society) exploration group led by V.T. Muravsky. The FSB, successor to the NKVD and KGB, finally handed the area over to the city council in 1990.
