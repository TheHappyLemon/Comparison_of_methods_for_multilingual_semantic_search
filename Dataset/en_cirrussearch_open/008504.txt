The Admiralty House (Swedish: Amiralitetshuset) is an admiralty house on the islet Skeppsholmen in central Stockholm, Sweden. Built in 1647-50 as the Admiralty Board moved over to Skeppsholmen, and probably designed by Louis Gillis, a Dutch architect operating in Stockholm since the 1620s, it was built in a Dutch Renaissance style with stepped gables, much like the present building, but the limestone portal is the only part remaining from this period. In 1680-1750 it was used as an archive, and then as a corn stable until 1794 when rebuilt as a barrack. Still used as the latter, it was redesigned in 1844-46 by the architect Fredrik Blom as a Neo-Renaissance building with turrets added on the corners. It was rebuilt in 1952 by Rudolf Cronstedt to accommodate the Admiralty again, but today houses the Swedish Tourist Association (Svenska Turistf√∂reningen, STF).
