Cierva Cove (64°9′S 60°53′W﻿ / ﻿64.150°S 60.883°W﻿ / -64.150; -60.883) is a cove lying 6 nautical miles (11 km) southeast of Cape Sterneck in Hughes Bay, just south of Chavdar Peninsula along the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica. Shown on an Argentine government chart of 1950, it was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960 for Juan de la Cierva, the Spanish designer of the autogiro, which was the first successful rotating wing aircraft in 1923.
