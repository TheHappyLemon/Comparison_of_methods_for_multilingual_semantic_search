The Cathedral of the Theotokos in Vilnius (Lithuanian: Vilniaus Dievo Motinos Ėmimo į Dangų katedra; Russian: Пречи́стенский кафедра́льный собо́р) is the episcopal see of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania. Between 1415 and 1795, it was the mother church of the Ruthenian Orthodox Church and the Ruthenian Uniate Church (following the 1596 Union of Brest) within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and then the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
