Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is a 2013 American fantasy horror film that stars Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton as the siblings from the fairy tale "Hansel and Gretel" who are now grown up and work together to exterminate witches for hire. The film is written and directed by Tommy Wirkola. The film also stars Famke Janssen and Peter Stormare as the supporting cast. In 2010, after being approached by Gary Sanchez Productions, Wirkola pitched the film to Paramount Pictures. Renner was cast as Hansel in September 2010 whilst the role of Gretel was planned for Noomi Rapace before Arterton's casting in January 2011. Principal photography began in March 2011, taking place at Babelsberg Studio in Germany. Filming concluded in June that year. Originally scheduled for release in March 2012, the film was delayed to allow additional time to shoot a post-credits scene with Renner. Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters was theatrically released in the United States on January 25, 2013. Despite receiving generally negative reviews from critics, particularly for what they saw as its weak script and gratuitous violence, the film was a box-office hit, grossing $226 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million.
