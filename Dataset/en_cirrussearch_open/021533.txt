Powell Island is a narrow island 13 km (8.1 mi) long and 4 km (2.5 mi) wide, lying between Coronation and Laurie Islands in the central part of the South Orkney Islands of Antarctica. Its southern end lies 7 km east of the south-western extremity of Coronation Island, between Lewthwaite Strait and Washington Strait. A steep-sided rocky ridge forms the western part of the island; to the east of it lies a broad icy piedmont which is visibly supported in the east by a few low-lying rock outcrops.,
