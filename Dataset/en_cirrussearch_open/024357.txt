The first level of country subdivisions of Iran are the provinces (Persian: استان‌ها; ostānhā). Each province is further subdivided into counties called shahrestan (Persian: شهرستان, romanized: shahrestān), and each county (or shahrestan) is subdivided into districts called bakhsh (Persian: بخش, romanized: bakhsh). There are usually a few cities (Persian: شهر, romanized: shahr) and rural districts called dehestan (Persian: دهستان, romanized: dehestān) in each district (or bakhsh). Rural districts are a collection of a number of villages. One of the cities of the county is appointed as the capital of the county.
