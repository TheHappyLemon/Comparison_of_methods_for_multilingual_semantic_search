Tatar edition of Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The Tatar Wikipedia (Tatar: Татар Википедиясе) is the Tatar language edition of Wikipedia. Launched in September 2003, It currently has 501,065 articles, making it the 30th largest Wikipedia by article count. This Wikipedia has 6 administrators along with 50,862 registered users and 87 active users. The Tatar Wikipedia mainly uses the Cyrillic script. However, unlike most other Cyrillic-based languages, some of the articles are in Latin script; accordingly, the language name appears in the language sidebar in both scripts. One of the most active participators and promoters of Tatar Wikipedia is Farhad Fatkullin, Wikimedian of the Year 2018. An organized group of editors from Bashkir Wikipedia entitled Wikigrannies sometimes actively participate in editing of Tatar Wikipedia as these languages are very close and often cross-used in native areas.
