The 1958 Women's World Chess Championship was a rematch between defending champion Olga Rubtsova and ex-champion Elisabeth Bykova, who she had won the title from in 1956. The match was played in Moscow from 4 February to 12 March. It was a 16-game event (the first player to reach 8.5 points will be the winner.) Bykova won the match convincingly, regaining the title.
