The 2014 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League, the 59th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 22nd season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. The match took place on Saturday, 24 May 2014, at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal, between Spanish sides Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid. It was the fifth tournament final to feature two teams from the same association, the second all-Spanish final and the first between teams from the same city. Real Madrid won the match 4–1 after extra time, with goals from Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo following a 93rd-minute header by Sergio Ramos, which cancelled out Diego Godín's first-half goal. In doing so, Real Madrid secured a record 10th title in the competition, 12 years after their ninth victory. As the winners, Real Madrid earned the right to play against 2013–14 UEFA Europa League winners Sevilla in the 2014 UEFA Super Cup. They also qualified to enter the semi-finals of the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup as the UEFA representative, ultimately triumphing in both competitions.
