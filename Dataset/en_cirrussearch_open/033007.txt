The 2014 Hungarian Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 Pirelli Magyar Nagydíj 2014) was a Formula One motor race held on 27 July 2014 at the Hungaroring in Mogyoród, Hungary. It was the eleventh round of the 2014 Formula One season and the 30th Hungarian Grand Prix, and the 29th time it had been held as a round of the World Championship. The 70-lap race was won by Daniel Ricciardo for the Red Bull Racing team after starting from fourth position. Fernando Alonso finished second in for Ferrari (the final podium of his career until the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix), with Lewis Hamilton third for Mercedes. The race was only the third Hungarian Grand Prix to be rain-affected, after the 2006 and 2011 races. Thunderstorms and heavy rain soaked the track at around lunchtime, forcing the drivers to start on intermediates before the track dried out later on in the race.
