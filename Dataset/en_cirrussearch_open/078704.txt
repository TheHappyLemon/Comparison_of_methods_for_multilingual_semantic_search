Happy Tree Friends (commonly abbreviated as HTF) is an American adult animated web series created by Aubrey Ankrum, Rhode Montijo, and Kenn Navarro, and developed by Montijo, Navarro, and Warren Graff for Mondo Media. Disguised as a kids' cartoon, the show follows the misadventures of cute anthropomorphic forest animals, whose initially peaceful lives always end with sudden, usually accidental, graphically violent incidents. Debuting on December 24, 1999, Happy Tree Friends has achieved a cult following on Mondo's website and YouTube channel and expanded into a multimedia franchise, which includes the television series of the same name.
