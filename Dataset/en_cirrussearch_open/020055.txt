Bennett is an English surname and, less commonly, a given name. Alternative spellings include Bennet, Benett and Benet. It is common throughout the British Isles, in England, Scotland and also in Ireland.[citation needed] It is related also to the medieval name Benedict from the Latin "Benedictus" meaning "well-spoken of" or "blessed". Bennett is the English spelling of the Anglo-Norman name Ben[n]et (modern French first name Benoît, surname Bénet). The oldest public record of the surname is dated 1208 in County Durham in North East England. In Ireland, the name is an Irish rendition of Beinéid, which is located in South Leinster. The name is also found throughout the southeastern providence of Ulster in Northern Ireland in the form of "MacBennett" in County Monaghan, County Down, and County Tyrone. Bennett was also found in Perthshire in Scotland. According to author George F. Black, Benedictus, the son of Walter de Sancto Edmundo, witnessed a charter of sale of land in Perth in 1219. The name was common in Edinburgh throughout the 17th century. The variant "Bennet" is more common throughout Scotland, while Bennett is common along the Anglo-Scottish border.
