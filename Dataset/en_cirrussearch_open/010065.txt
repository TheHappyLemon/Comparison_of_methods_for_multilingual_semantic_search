The Million Pound Drop (also The Million Pound Drop Live and briefly The £100K Drop) is a British game show which was broadcast on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. The show was first aired on 24 May 2010 and was presented by Davina McCall. The show used social networking sites (such as Facebook and Twitter) to advertise the show as well as to find contestants. David Flynn, managing director of Endemol's Remarkable Television, which produced the show, said: "The plan was to create buzz and an air of mystery around the show by trickling information about auditions via Twitter and Facebook, giving fans a level of exclusivity." After a three-year hiatus the series returned in a daily afternoon slot in May 2018 but with a reduced prize fund of £100,000 and with a new name, namely The £100K Drop, and McCall reprising her role. The new format presented three series totalling 120 episodes. The show was cancelled in December 2019.
