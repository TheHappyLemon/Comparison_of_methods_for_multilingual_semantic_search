The shar pei (Chinese: 沙皮; Cantonese Yale: shā pèih; pinyin: shā pí) is a dog breed from southern China. Traditionally kept as a property guardian, the shar pei was driven to the brink of extinction in the 20th century. The breed is known in the West for its deep wrinkles, while a traditional less wrinkled form is maintained in Hong Kong.
