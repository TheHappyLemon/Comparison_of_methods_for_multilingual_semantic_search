Mykines (Danish: Myggen√¶s) is the westernmost of the 18 main islands of the Faroese Archipelago. It lies west of 7.5 degrees W, effectively putting it in the UTC-1 region. However, Mykines uses Greenwich Mean Time like the rest of the Faroes. The only settlement on the island is also called Mykines.
