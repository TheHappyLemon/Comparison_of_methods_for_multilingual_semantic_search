The Swedish extradition of Baltic soldiers, or simply the Extradition of the Balts (Swedish: Baltutl√§mningen), was a controversial political event that took place in January 1946, in the aftermath of World War II when Sweden, a neutral country during the war, extradited to the Soviet Union some 150 Latvian and Estonian soldiers who had been recruited into Waffen-SS by Germany as well as nine Lithuanian soldiers who had been fighting against the Soviet invasion of the Baltic states during the war. Many of them were subsequently imprisoned and several sentenced to death by the Soviet government.
