She began her career as a child actress, starring on the children's television series Barney & Friends (2002–2004). Gomez rose to prominence and emerged as a teen idol, for her leading role as Alex Russo on the Disney Channel sitcom Wizards of Waverly Place (2007–2012). As a recording artist, she signed with Hollywood Records in 2008 and formed the pop rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene, for which she served as lead vocalist. With three studio albums and seven singles, each of the band's releases have received gold certifications or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Further pursuing a career as a soloist, Gomez found continued success with her solo studio albums, as each have debuted atop the US Billboard 200. Her EDM-inspired debut, Stars Dance (2013) yielded the international top-ten single "Come & Get It". Desiring more artistic control, Gomez signed with Interscope Records to release the electropop set Revival (2015), supported by the top-ten singles "Good for You", "Same Old Love", and "Hands to Myself". Its follow-up, Rare (2020), topped the charts in 11 countries, and was led by the single "Lose You to Love Me", which marked Gomez's first number-one song on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100. She forayed into Spanish-language music with the extended play Revelación (2021), which earned her first Grammy and Latin Grammy Award nominations. Gomez has also released various collaborative singles, including "We Don't Talk Anymore", "It Ain't Me", "Wolves", "Taki Taki", and "Calm Down (Remix)"; the latter became the most commercially successful Afrobeats song of all time and became the best-selling collaboration of 2023 globally. Gomez has starred in numerous films, including voicing Mavis in the Hotel Transylvania film franchise (2012–2022). On television, she produced the teen drama series 13 Reasons Why (2017–2020), the documentary Living Undocumented (2019), her cooking show Selena + Chef (2020–present), and the mystery comedy series Only Murders in the Building (2021–present), in which she plays a lead acting role. Gomez has received numerous accolades, including an American Music Award, a Billboard Music Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, and 16 Guinness World Records; and received nominations for four Emmy Awards, two Grammy Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. Outside of music and acting, Gomez has worked with various charitable organizations, and advocates for mental health, and gender, racial, and LGBT equality; she has been a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since 2009. She launched the cosmetics company Rare Beauty in 2020, which was valued at $2 billion in 2024, and founded the Rare Impact Fund, a non-profit committed to raising $100 million this decade for mental health awareness.
