"Hakuna matata" is a Swahili phrase, meaning "no trouble" or "no worries" and "take it easy" (literally hakuna: "there is no/there are no"; matata: "worries".) The 1994 Walt Disney Animation Studios animated film The Lion King brought the phrase to Western prominence in one of its most popular songs, in which it is translated as "no worries". The song is often heard at Disney's resorts, hotels, and amusement parks. Look up hakuna matata in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
