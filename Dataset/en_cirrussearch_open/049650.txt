Alvin and the Chipmunks is a 2007 American jukebox musical comedy film directed by Tim Hill from a screenplay by Jon Vitti and the writing team of Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi, based on the characters of the same name created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr.. The film stars Jason Lee, David Cross and Cameron Richardson, while Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney voice the titular Chipmunks. The film follows the Chipmunks (Alvin, Simon and Theodore), who move in with struggling songwriter Dave Seville after they lose their home. When Dave discovers they have rare singing talent, he has them perform in front of JETT Records executive Ian Hawke, who then plans to trick them into living with him to profit off their success with a world tour. Alvin and the Chipmunks was released in the United States on December 14, 2007, by 20th Century Fox. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the film's humor and "rehashed kids' movie formula". However, it grossed over $361 million worldwide against a $60 million budget and was the seventh-best-selling DVD of 2008 in United States. The film was followed by three sequels: Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel in 2009, Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked in 2011, and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip in 2015.
