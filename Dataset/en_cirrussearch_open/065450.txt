Marco Johann Sturm (born September 8, 1978) is a German professional ice hockey coach and former winger who played in the National Hockey League and Deutsche Eishockey Liga from 1995 to 2013. He is currently the Head Coach of the Ontario Reign. Sturm began his career with the German club EV Landshut, playing with the team from 1995 to 1997. Selected 21st overall in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft by the San Jose Sharks, he played his rookie season with the team in 1997–98. After eight-and-a-half seasons with the Sharks, he was traded to the Boston Bruins as part of a package deal for Joe Thornton in November 2005. Sturm remained with Boston until 2010–11, when he split the campaign with the Los Angeles Kings and Washington Capitals. He signed with the Vancouver Canucks as an unrestricted free agent in July 2011, but was quickly traded to the Florida Panthers less than a month into the subsequent season. A one-time NHL All-Star (1999), Sturm established himself as a consistent 20-goal scorer in the league, achieving the mark seven of eight times between 2001–02 and 2009–10. He was the most productive German player in the league until Leon Draisaitl surpassed him in 2021. Internationally, Sturm competed for Germany in four IIHF World Championships, two Winter Olympics and one World Cup.
