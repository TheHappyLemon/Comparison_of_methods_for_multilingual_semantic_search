"Thrift Shop" is a song written and performed by American hip hop duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis featuring vocals from American singer Wanz, released in 2012, as the fourth single from the former's debut studio album, The Heist (2012). The lyrics tell of Macklemore's esteem for going to thrift shops and saving money, rather than flaunting expensive items like many rappers. The song was met with universal acclaim, with various music reviewers praising its humorous lyrics and social critique. Despite being released on Macklemore's independent record label with distribution by the Alternative Distribution Alliance (ADA), a Warner Music Group company, the single was a sleeper hit. It reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and has since sold over 6 million copies in the US alone. The song also reached number one in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand. The song would go on to become the number one song of 2013 by Billboard and in 2019, it was named by Billboard as the number one song of the 2010s on both the Hot Rap Songs and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. A music video was released simultaneously with the song on August 27, 2012, and has more than 1.8Â billion views on YouTube as of November 2023. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014, the single won for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song.
