Jerry Maguire was inspired by an experience the sports agent Leigh Steinberg, a technical consultant for the film, had with the client Tim McDonald during the 1993 NFL season when free agency was introduced. The film was also partly inspired by a 28-page memo written at Disney in 1991 by Jeffrey Katzenberg. Jerry Maguire received positive reviews for its performances and screenplay. It grossed more than $273 million worldwide against its $50 million budget. It was the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1996.

It received nominations for three Golden Globes, with Cruise winning for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards, with Gooding winning Best Supporting Actor. Jerry Maguire gained a cult following and has spawned several catchphrases into popular culture, such as "Show me the money!" and "You had me at 'Hello'", "You complete me", and "Help me help you".
