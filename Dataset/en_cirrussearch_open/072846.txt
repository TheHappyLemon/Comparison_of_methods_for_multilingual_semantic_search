Dominika Cibulková (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈdɔminika ˈtsibulkɔʋaː]; born 6 May 1989) is a Slovak former professional tennis player. She is the 2016 WTA Finals champion, becoming the fourth player (after Serena Williams in 2001, Maria Sharapova in 2004 and Petra Kvitová in 2011) to win the tournament on her debut. She won eight WTA Tour singles titles and two on the ITF Circuit. Cibulková reached the quarterfinals or better of all four Grand Slam tournaments at least once. One of her most notable achievements was a final appearance at the 2014 Australian Open. Although she lost to Li Na, she was the first female Slovak to reach the final of a Grand Slam tournament. Cibulková gained her international notoriety in a 2018 incident against Taiwanese player Hsieh Su-wei and earned herself a spot among one of the worst sportsmanship moments in tennis history. [3]
