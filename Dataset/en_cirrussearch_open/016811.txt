Akmenė (pronounced [ɐkˈmɛːneː] ) is a city in northern Lithuania. Following the discovery of large reserves of limestone and clay in the region, in 1947 construction work began on one of the largest cement production complexes in the Baltic States. Nearby, a new town grew up which was to become the region's administrative centre: Naujoji Akmenė ("New Akmenė").
