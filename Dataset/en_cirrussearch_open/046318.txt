The Last Airbender is a 2010 American action adventure fantasy film written, co-produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It is based on Book One: Water, the first season of the 2005â€“08 animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. The film stars Noah Ringer, Dev Patel, Nicola Peltz, Jackson Rathbone, Shaun Toub, Aasif Mandvi, and Cliff Curtis. The plot follows Aang, a young Avatar who must master all four elements of air, water, fire, and earth and restore balance to the world while stopping the Fire Nation from conquering the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom. Development for the film began in January 2007, and the casting and pre-production process happened during 2008. Principal photography began on March 2009 and ended on September, with a preliminary schedule held in Greenland for two weeks, and the rest of the film being shot in major locations across Pennsylvania, United States. Post-production began in August and took several months due to extensive visual effects. The name Avatar was dropped from the title to avoid confusion with James Cameron's 2009 film Avatar. The Last Airbender premiered at the Alice Tully Hall in New York City on June 30, 2010, and was theatrically released in United States on July 1, by Paramount Pictures. The film was universally panned by critics and fans, with several publications calling it one of the worst films of all time. Produced on a $150 million budget, the film grossed $319.7 million worldwide. The Last Airbender was originally envisioned as the first of a trilogy of films based on the three seasons of the series, but due to its disappointing box office performance and extremely negative reviews, the planned trilogy was ultimately scrapped.
