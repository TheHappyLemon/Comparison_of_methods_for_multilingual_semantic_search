Saint Philip, officially the Parish of Saint Philip, is a civil parish of Antigua and Barbuda, on the easternmost portion of Antigua island. Its capital is the village of St. Philip's. Saint Philip borders Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Saint Philip faces the Atlantic Ocean. Saint Philip is surrounded by various islands and islets. It had a population of 3,347 in 2011, which makes it the least populous parish of Antigua and Barbuda. Saint Philip is known for its good shore snorkeling in the Half Moon Bay area. While Saint Philip is a civil administrative division, the Anglican parish church is located in the village of St. Phillip's. Saint Philip is often considered to be the most isolated parish on the island, due to its isolated location from the main urban areas, and its low population density. Like most other parishes on Antigua, in its early colonial history, it was often dominated by the sugar industry, with some regions having smaller industries of cavalier rum, cattle, and muscovado sugar. Saint Philip was founded on 11 January 1692, along with the four other founding parishes, for the original purpose of serving the parish church.
