The 1967–68 European Cup was the 13th European Cup, UEFA's premier club football tournament. The competition was won by Manchester United, who beat Benfica 4–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium, London. The European Cup title marked the tenth year since the Munich air disaster, in which eight United players were killed and their manager, Matt Busby, was left close to death, the day after earning a place in the semi-finals of the 1957–58 competition. It was also the first time an English side had won the trophy. The away goals rule (which had already been used in the Cup Winners' Cup and the Fairs' Cup) was introduced if aggregate scores were level after two legs, but only for the first round of the competition. Extra time goals were not included in the rule. Celtic were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Dynamo Kyiv in the first round.
