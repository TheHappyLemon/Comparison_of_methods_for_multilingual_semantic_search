Sheep and Wolves (Russian: Волки и овцы: бе-е-е-зумное превращение, romanized: Volki i ovtsy. Be-e-e-zumnoe prevrashchenie, lit. 'Wolves and Sheep: Cra-a-a-zy Transformation') is a 2016 Russian animated fantasy comedy film, directed by Andrey Galat and Maxim Volkov. The original story, Wizart Animation's first, contains elements of the fairy tale The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats and the concepts of a wolf in sheep's clothing. It is about a carefree wolf who likes to hunt sheep, but one day finds that he has been magically transformed into a sheep himself. Although critical reactions were mostly positive in its native country, the film received generally negative reviews elsewhere, with the script, plot, characterizations and lore being heavily criticized; though the animation received some praise. It won the Golden Unicorn Award for best animation film, the Grand Prix from the Seoul Guro International Kids Films Festival and the Catalina Film Festival Crystal Trophy. Despite the film's poor reception and disappointing box office performance, a theatrical sequel titled Sheep and Wolves: Pig Deal, was released in 2019.
