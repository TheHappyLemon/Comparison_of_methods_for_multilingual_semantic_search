Perm Krai (Russian: Пе́рмский край, romanized: Permsky kray, IPA: [ˈpʲɛrmskʲɪj ˈkraj]; Komi-Permyak: Перем ладор, romanized: Perem lador) is a federal subject of Russia (a krai), located in Eastern Europe. Its administrative center is Perm. The population of the krai was 2,532,405 (2021 Census). The krai was formed on 1 December 2005 as a result of the 2004 referendum on the merger of Perm Oblast and Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug. Komi-Permyak Okrug retained its autonomous status within Perm Krai during the transitional period of 2006–2008. It also retained a budget separate from that of the krai, keeping all federal transfers. Starting in 2009, Komi-Permyak Okrug's budget became subject to the budgeting law of Perm Krai. The transitional period was implemented in part because Komi-Permyak Okrug relied heavily on federal subsidies, and an abrupt cut would have been detrimental to its economy.
