Football Club Volendam (Dutch pronunciation: [ˌvoːlə(n)ˈdɑm]) is a professional football club based in Volendam, Netherlands. They play in the Eredivisie, the top tier of Dutch football from the 2022–23 season following promotion. Nicknamed "de Palingboeren", the club was founded as Victoria in 1920, changed its name to RKSV Volendam in 1923 and emerged as an exclusively professional club, FC Volendam, in 1977, following a split from its parent club. The team plays its home matches in the 6,984-capacity Kras Stadion, where it has been based since 1975. The club has a reputation as the heen-en-weer club ("the back-and-forth club") due to its numerous promotions and relegations between the first and second tiers of Dutch football. They have achieved ten promotions to the Eredivisie; a record. Volendam also reached two KNVB Cup finals – in 1957–58 and 1994–95 – which ended in losses to two Rotterdam-based clubs, Sparta and Feyenoord, respectively.
