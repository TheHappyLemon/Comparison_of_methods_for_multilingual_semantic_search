The UCI Road World Championships – Mixed team relay is a world championship for road bicycle racing in the discipline of team time trial. It is organized by the world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). First staged at the 2019 UCI Road World Championships, it replaced the men's and women's team time trial events. The race is held with national teams, which each have 6 riders per team, 3 women and 3 men. The event features two laps of a course around 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) to 20 kilometres (12 mi) in length, with the women and men each doing one lap, one after another. The team with the shortest time to complete both laps wins.
