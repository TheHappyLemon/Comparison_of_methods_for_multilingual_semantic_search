Eutelsat Quantum is a communications satellite developed in the framework of a public-private partnership between the European Space Agency, Eutelsat and Airbus Defence and Space. Operated by Eutelsat, its design allows for it to reconfigure its radios coverage zone and alter its performance according its needs. It is located in a geostationary orbit and its longitude may be modified to cover any region in the world. The satellite was launched on 30 July 2021 by an Ariane 5 rocket, together with the Brazilian Star One D2 satellite. Quantum is Eutelsat's 36th and Airbus Defence and Space's 132nd satellite launched by Arianespace. The satellite uses conventional chemical thrusters. The payload, which operates in the Ku-band, has a power rating of 5Â kW. A key component of the satellite is its phased-array antenna, which was produced by Airbus's Spanish division CASA.
