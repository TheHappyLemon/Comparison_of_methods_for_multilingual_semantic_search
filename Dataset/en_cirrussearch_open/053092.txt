A deposit is the act of placing cash (or cash equivalent) with some entity, most commonly with a financial institution, such as a bank. The deposit is a credit for the party (individual or organization) who placed it, and it may be taken back (withdrawn) in accordance with the terms agreed at time of deposit, transferred to some other party, or used for a purchase at a later date. Deposits are usually the main source of funding for banks.
