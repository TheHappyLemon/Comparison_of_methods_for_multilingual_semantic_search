Dasmariñas (Tagalog: [dɐsmaˈɾiɲɐs]), officially the City of Dasmariñas (Filipino: Lungsod ng Dasmariñas), is a 1st class component city in the province of Cavite, Philippines. With a land area of 90.1 square kilometers (34.8 sq mi)  and a population of 703,141 people according to the 2020 census, it is the largest city both in terms of area and population in Cavite and the wealthiest Local Government Unit in terms of city in the province. Being located just 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) from Imus and 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Manila, the growing congestion and outward urban expansion of the Manila Metropolitan area has led to its rapid development in the late 1900s. This growth is manifested by the influx of major shopping malls, hospitals, universities, banks, industrial parks, and the growing number of residential subdivisions accommodating its growing population.
