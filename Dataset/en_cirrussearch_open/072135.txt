Naujoji Akmenė (pronunciation; Samogitian: Naujuojė Akmenė) is a town in north-western Lithuania, in the Šiauliai County, in the Samogitia region. It was established as a new town in 1952 and is one of the newest cities in Lithuania. Its name means New Akmenė. It is an industrial base with concrete as its main product, with Public company Akmenės Cementas (English: Akmenė Concrete) producing 700,000 tonnes of concrete annually. As a new city, it did initially have well-developed infrastructure. For example, a special branch of the railway had to be built for the factory needs. The road network was rapidly developing before the city even existed.
