Potassium chlorate is a compound containing potassium, chlorine and oxygen, with the molecular formula KClO3. In its pure form, it is a white crystalline substance. After sodium chlorate, it is the second most common chlorate in industrial use. It is a strong oxidizing agent and its most important application is in safety matches. In other applications it is mostly obsolete and has been replaced by safer alternatives in recent decades. It has been used in fireworks, propellants and explosives, to prepare oxygen, both in the lab and in chemical oxygen generators, as a disinfectant, for example in medical mouthwashes, in agriculture as an herbicide.
