Krzyż harcerski (Polish for Scouts Cross) is the emblem of Polish Scouting, awarded to Polish Scouts, Senior Scouts and Rangers. It was first used by an underground Scouting organization in Warsaw in 1913. The initial design by Kazimierz Lutosławski has not been modified substantially since then. It is worn on a Scout uniform, over the heart, two fingers above the left pocket. In November 1918 the Polish Ministry of War decreed that the Krzyż Harcerski was the only civilian honour that may be worn on military uniforms. The tradition continues to this day.
