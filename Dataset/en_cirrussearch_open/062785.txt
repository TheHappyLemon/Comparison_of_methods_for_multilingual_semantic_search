Montenegrins (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Црногорци, romanized: Crnogorci, pronounced [tsr̩nǒɡoːrtsi] or [tsr̩noɡǒːrtsi]; lit. "Black Mountain People") are a South Slavic ethnic group that share a common ancestry, culture, history, and language, identified with the country of Montenegro. Montenegrins are mostly Orthodox Christians, but also Catholics, Muslims and irreligious. The Montenegrin language is the official language of Montenegro. Historically, the Montenegrin nation was made up of many tribes. Most tribes were formed in the 15th and 16th centuries, during and after the Ottoman conquest of the medieval state of Zeta. Today they are mainly studied within the frameworks of social anthropology and family history, as they have not been used in official structures since the time of the Principality of Montenegro, although some tribal regions overlap with contemporary municipal areas. The kinship groups give a sense of shared identity and descent. Outside of Montenegro and Europe, Montenegrins form diaspora groups in the United States, Canada, Australia and Argentina. It is estimated that around 600,000 Montenegrins reside outside of Montenegro, according to descent. In 2023 there are 152,649 Montenegrins holding Montenegrin citizenship who reside outside of Montenegro.
