Under the Skin is a 2013 science fiction film directed by Jonathan Glazer and written by Glazer and Walter Campbell, loosely based on the 2000 novel by Michel Faber. It stars Scarlett Johansson as an otherworldly woman who preys on men in Scotland. The film premiered at Telluride Film Festival on 29 August 2013. It was released in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2014, and in other territories later in the year. Glazer developed Under the Skin for over a decade. He and Campbell pared it back from an elaborate, special effects-heavy concept to a sparse story focusing on an alien perspective on the human world. Most of the cast had no acting experience, and many scenes were filmed with hidden cameras. Under the Skin was acclaimed for Johansson's performance, Glazer's direction, and Mica Levi's score. It received numerous accolades and awards, was named the best film of the year by various critics and publications, appeared on many best-of-the-decade lists, and was ranked 61st on the BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century list. It was a box-office failure, grossing around US$7 million on a budget of $13.3 million.
