The Czech Gold Brindled Hen, Czech: Česká slepice zlatě kropenatá, is an old breed of chicken originating in Bohemia. The first mention dates from 1205, when a flock of these chickens was presented to Valdemar II of Denmark as a wedding gift on his marriage to the Czech princess Dagmar of Bohemia. Nowadays it is an endangered breed.
