Warsaw Governorate was an administrative-territorial unit (guberniya) of Congress Poland of the Russian Empire. It was created in 1844 from the Masovia and Kalisz Governorates, and had the capital in Warsaw. In 1867 territories of the Warsaw Governorate were divided into three smaller governorates: a smaller Warsaw Governorate, Piotrków Governorate and the recreated Kalisz Governorate. A small reform in 1893 increased the Warsaw Governorate's size with territories split from Płock and Łomża governorates.
