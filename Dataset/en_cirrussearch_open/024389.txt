Kropyvnytskyi (Ukrainian: Кропивницький, IPA: [kropɪu̯ˈnɪtsʲkɪj] ) is a city in central Ukraine, situated on the Inhul River. It serves as the administrative center of Kirovohrad Oblast. Population: 219,676 (2022 estimate). Over its history, Kropyvnytskyi has changed its name several times. The settlement was known as Yelysavethrad (Єлисаветград, IPA: [jɛlʲɪsɑvʲɛtˈɦrɑd]) after Empress Elizabeth of Russia from 1752 to 1924, or simply Elysavet. In 1924, as part of the Soviet Union, it became known as Zinovievsk (Зінов'євськ, IPA: [zʲinɔu̯ˈjɛu̯sʲk]) in honour of the revolutionary Grigory Zinoviev, who was born there. Following the assassination of Sergei Kirov in 1934, the town was renamed Kirovo (Кірово, IPA: [ˈkʲirɔwɔ]) in his honour. Concurrently with the formation of Kirovohrad Oblast on 10 January 1939, and to distinguish it from Kirov Oblast in central Russia, Kirovo was renamed Kirovohrad (Кіровоград, IPA: [kirɔwɔˈɦrɑd]). As part of independent Ukraine, the name of the city was then changed to Kropyvnytskyi in 2016 due to decommunization laws, in honour of Marko Kropyvnytskyi, who was born near the city. However, Kirovohrad Oblast was not renamed because it is mentioned in the Constitution of Ukraine – only a constitutional amendment could change the name of the oblast. During the Ukrainian presidential election of 2004 the city achieved country-wide notoriety due to mass election fraud committed by local authorities and after that became known as District 100 (its community number according to the Central Elections Committee). Notable figures born in the city include Grigory Zinoviev, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Arseny Tarkovsky, Afrikan Spir, Marko Kropyvnytskyi, and others.
