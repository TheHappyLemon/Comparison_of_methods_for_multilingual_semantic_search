Look up million in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 1,000,000 (one million), or one thousand thousand, is the natural number following 999,999 and preceding 1,000,001. The word is derived from the early Italian millione (milione in modern Italian), from mille, "thousand", plus the augmentative suffix -one. It is commonly abbreviated: in British English as m (not to be confused with the metric prefix "m" milli, for 10−3, or with metre), M, MM ("thousand thousands", from Latin "Mille"; not to be confused with the Roman numeral MM = 2,000), mm (not to be confused with millimetre), or mn, mln, or mio can be found in financial contexts. In scientific notation, it is written as 1×106 or 106. Physical quantities can also be expressed using the SI prefix mega (M), when dealing with SI units; for example, 1 megawatt (1 MW) equals 1,000,000 watts. The meaning of the word "million" is common to the short scale and long scale numbering systems, unlike the larger numbers, which have different names in the two systems. The million is sometimes used in the English language as a metaphor for a very large number, as in "Not in a million years" and "You're one in a million", or a hyperbole, as in "I've walked a million miles" and "You've asked a million-dollar question". 1,000,000 is also the square of 1000 and also the cube of 100.
