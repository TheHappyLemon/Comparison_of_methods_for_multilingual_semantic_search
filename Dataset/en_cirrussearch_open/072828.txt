Semigallia, also spelt Semigalia (Latvian: Zemgale, German: Semgallen, Lithuanian: Žiemgala, Polish: Semigalia, Livonian: Zemgāl), is one of the Historical Latvian Lands located to the south of the Daugava river and to the north of the Saule region of Samogitia. The territory is split between Latvia and Lithuania, previously inhabited by the Semigallian Baltic tribe. They are noted for their long resistance (1219–1290) against the German crusaders and Teutonic Knights during the Northern Crusades. Semigallians had close linguistic and cultural ties with Samogitians.
