The 2017 Gent–Wevelgem – In Flanders Fields was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 26 March. It was the 79th edition of Gent–Wevelgem and the twelfth event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. After winning E3 Harelbeke two days prior to Gent–Wevelgem, Greg Van Avermaet continued his run of good form with victory for the BMC Racing Team in a two-up sprint finish against his fellow Belgian Jens Keukeleire, riding for the Orica–Scott team. The pairing had broken away from a select group of riders in the run-in towards Wevelgem. The podium was completed by world champion Peter Sagan (Bora–Hansgrohe), as the peloton caught the select group in the closing metres.
