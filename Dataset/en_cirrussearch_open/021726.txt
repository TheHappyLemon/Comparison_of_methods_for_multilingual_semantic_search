The Seljuk dynasty, or Seljukids (/ˈsɛldʒʊk/ SEL-juuk; Persian: سلجوقیان Saljuqian, alternatively spelled as Seljuqs or Saljuqs), Seljuqs, also known as Seljuk Turks, Seljuk Turkomans or the Saljuqids, was an Oghuz Turkic, Sunni Muslim dynasty that gradually became Persianate and contributed to Turco-Persian culture in West Asia and Central Asia. The Seljuks established the Seljuk Empire (1037–1194), the Sultanate of Kermân (1041–1186) and the Sultanate of Rum (1074–1308), which stretched from Iran to Anatolia and were the prime targets of the First Crusade.
