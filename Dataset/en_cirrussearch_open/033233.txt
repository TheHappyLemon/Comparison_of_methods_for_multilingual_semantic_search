Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (Ukrainian: Іва́но-Франкі́вська о́бласть, romanized: Ivano-Frankivska oblast), also referred to as Ivano-Frankivshchyna (Ukrainian: Іва́но-Франкі́вщина), is an oblast (region) in western Ukraine. Its administrative center is the city of Ivano-Frankivsk. It has a population of 1,351,822 (2022 estimate). The area, also known as Prykarpattia, was part of the historical region of Galicia, where the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia flourished. After World War I, the area became part of the Second Polish Republic and was administered as part of Stanisławów Voivodeship until the invasion of Poland. The area was annexed by the Soviet Union and was known as Stanislav Oblast until 1962, when its administrative center was renamed after the Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko. Kolomyia was a historical center of the oblast and remains a major cultural center of Pokuttia, the traditional name for the southern part of the oblast.
