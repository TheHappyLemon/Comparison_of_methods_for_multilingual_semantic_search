During the Soviet-era, the Abkhaz ASSR was divided into six raions (districts) named after their respective capitals. The administrative divisions of the disputed Republic of Abkhazia have stayed the same, with one exception: in 1995, Tkvarcheli District was created around the town of Tkvarcheli from parts of the Ochamchira and Gali districts. The Georgian government, which claims Abkhazia as an autonomous republic but lacks control, has not changed the subdivisions from the Soviet-era.
