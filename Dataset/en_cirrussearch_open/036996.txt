The 2017 Tour Down Under was a road cycling stage race that took place between 17 and 22 January 2017 in and around Adelaide, South Australia. It was the 19th edition of the Tour Down Under and was the first event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. BMC Racing Team rider Richie Porte won the race for the first time, holding the race lead from the second day onwards following his stage win into Paracombe. Porte added a second stage win – the queen stage at Willunga Hill – as he ultimately won the race by 48 seconds ahead of his closest challenger. Orica–Scott's Esteban Chaves finished in second place, having taken third-place finishes in both of the stages won by Porte; third place on the podium was decided on the final day of the race. Jay McCarthy (Bora–Hansgrohe) trailed Nathan Haas of Team Dimension Data by three seconds, but McCarthy was able to win the first intermediate sprint of the day – offering three bonus seconds towards the general classification – after a lead-out from world champion teammate Peter Sagan. With McCarthy and Haas finishing tied on time, the final podium position went to McCarthy on countback. In the race's other classifications, Chaves' Orica–Scott teammate Caleb Ewan won the sprints classification, winning four of the six stages during the race, becoming the third rider to do so after his compatriot Robbie McEwen in 2002 and André Greipel in 2008, while Thomas De Gendt (Lotto–Soudal) won the mountains classification on the final day, taking points on the first climb of Montefiore Hill to assume the lead from Porte. Colombian Jhonatan Restrepo of Team Katusha–Alpecin was the winner of the young rider classification, finishing in tenth place overall, while the teams classification was won by the only non-UCI WorldTeam in the race, UniSA–Australia.
