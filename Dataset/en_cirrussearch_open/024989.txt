The president of Mongolia is the executive head of state of Mongolia. The current president is Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh. Political parties with representation in the State Great Khural nominate candidates. The president was originally limited to two four-year terms, but this was changed to a non-renewable six-year term starting with the 2021 presidential election. The president can be removed from office if two-thirds of the Khural find them guilty of abusing their powers or violating their oath. Before inauguration, however, the president-elect must suspend their membership of any political party.
