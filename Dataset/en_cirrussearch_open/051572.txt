Luis Eduardo Parra Rivero (born 7 July 1978) is a Venezuelan politician who was in a dispute with Juan Guaidó for a year over who was the President of the National Assembly of Venezuela based on a vote on 5 January 2020. The investigative journalism website Armando.info reported in 2019 that Parra was among nine lawmakers that mediated in favor of two businessmen linked with the government, and was accused of being involved in corruption with the Local Committees for Supply and Production (CLAP) program of the Nicolás Maduro government. After the investigation was published, Parra was expelled from his party Justice First, along with other deputies. Parra is currently subjected to foreign sanctions for his involvement in the 2020 Venezuelan National Assembly Delegated Committee election.
