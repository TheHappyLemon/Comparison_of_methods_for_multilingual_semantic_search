Jeļena Ostapenko defeated Simona Halep in the final, 4–6, 6–4, 6–3 to win the women's singles tennis title at the 2017 French Open. It was her first major title, and her first WTA Tour-level singles title overall. She became the first Latvian to win a major title, the youngest woman to win the French Open since Iva Majoli in 1997, and the first woman since Barbara Jordan at the 1979 Australian Open to win a major as her first tour-level singles title. Ostapenko was the first unseeded player to win a major since Kim Clijsters in the 2009 US Open. She was also the first unseeded player to win the title since Margaret Scriven in 1933, and the lowest-ranked to do so (world No. 47) since the computerized rankings began in 1975. Garbiñe Muguruza was the defending champion, but was defeated in the fourth round by Kristina Mladenovic. With the losses of Muguruza, Venus Williams, Samantha Stosur and Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round, a first-time Grand Slam champion was guaranteed. This marked the first French Open since 1977, and the first major since the 1979 Australian Open, not to feature a former major champion in the quarterfinals. Angelique Kerber retained the world No. 1 ranking after Halep lost in the final, even though she lost in the first round. Kerber's loss marked the first time that the top seed lost in the first round at any major since the 2001 Wimbledon Championships. This was the first French Open since 2011 to feature neither Maria Sharapova nor Serena Williams in the final. Williams was absent due to pregnancy, and Sharapova did not qualify based on her ranking. This was the first major appearance for future Wimbledon champion and French Open finalist Markéta Vondroušová; she was defeated in the second round by Daria Kasatkina.
