John Michael Hawthorn (10 April 1929 â€“ 22 January 1959) was a British racing driver. He became the United Kingdom's first Formula One World Champion driver in 1958, whereupon he announced his retirement, having been profoundly affected by the death of his teammate and friend Peter Collins two months earlier in the 1958 German Grand Prix. He died in a road accident three months after retiring. With a total of three career World Championship Grand Prix wins, Hawthorn has the lowest number of Grand Prix wins scored by any Formula One World Champion. Hawthorn had also won the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans.
