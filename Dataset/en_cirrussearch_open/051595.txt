Lolita Torres (born Beatriz Mariana Torres; 26 March 1930 â€“ 14 September 2002) was an Argentine film actress and singer (soprano). She began her career at age 11, performing folk songs in a theater in Buenos Aires. In 1944 she began acting in films, eventually appearing in seventeen films during "Argentine cinema's 'golden years.'" She was so popular in the Soviet Union, that many newborn girls were named 'Lolita' after her tour there in 1963. In 2002 she was honored as "Ciudadano Ilustre de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires" ("Illustrious Citizen of the City of Buenos Aires"). The Plaza Lolita Torres in her birthplace of Avellaneda is named for her.
