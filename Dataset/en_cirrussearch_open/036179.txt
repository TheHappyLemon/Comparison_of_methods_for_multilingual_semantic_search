In mathematics, a transcendental function is an analytic function that does not satisfy a polynomial equation, in contrast to an algebraic function. In other words, a transcendental function "transcends" algebra in that it cannot be expressed algebraically using a finite amount of terms. Examples of transcendental functions include the exponential function, the logarithm, and the trigonometric functions.
