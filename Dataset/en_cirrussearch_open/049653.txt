The Hot Chick is a 2002 American fantasy comedy film directed by Tom Brady, from a screenplay by Brady and Rob Schneider, and starring Schneider, Anna Faris, Matthew Lawrence, Eric Christian Olsen, and Rachel McAdams in her film debut. The film follows Jessica Spencer (McAdams), a mean spirited cheerleader who switches bodies with incompetent criminal Clive Maxtone (Schneider). When Jessica discovers that the switch was caused by a pair of enchanted earrings she had stolen, one of which accidentally ended up in Clive's possession, she enlists the help of her friends to get the earrings back together before the switch becomes permanent. Adam Sandler served as executive producer and makes an uncredited cameo as the Mambuza Bongo Player, a character based on one played by Schneider on Saturday Night Live. Principal photography began in March 2002 in Los Angeles and concluded in May. The Hot Chick was theatrically released in the United States on December 13, 2002, and was a moderate box office success, grossing $54.6 million against its $34 million budget. Despite this, the film received negative reviews from critics, who criticized the jokes and Schneider's performance.
