Heydar Aliyev's cult of personality, also known as Heydarism (Azerbaijani: heyd…ôrizm), became a significant part of Azerbaijani politics and society after he came to power in 1993 and continuing after his death in 2003, when his son Ilham Aliyev succeeded him. Aliyev, a former Soviet politburo member and the leader of Soviet Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1987, became the President of Azerbaijan in 1993. He then began to carefully design an autocratic system, with heavy reliance on family and clan members, oil revenues and patronage. In Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev is presented as the "national leader of the Azeri nation".
