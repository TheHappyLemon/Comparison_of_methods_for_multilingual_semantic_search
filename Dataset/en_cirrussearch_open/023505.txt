Chystiakove (Ukrainian: Чистякове IPA: [t͡ʃɪsʲtʲɐˈkɔwe], Russian: Чистяково), formerly Torez (Ukrainian: Торез, Russian: Торез) until 2016, is a city in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. The city is a center of the regional coal industry and much of its economy relies on mining, despite a recent drop in the number of employed miners. The city has a population of 53,462 (2022 estimate). Founded in 1778, the city was named Chystiakove in 1868. It was renamed Torez in 1964 in honor of Maurice Thorez, a leader of the French Communist Party. In 2016, the Ukrainian parliament restored the name Chystiakove due to decommunization laws. Pro-Russian separatists took control of Chystiakove in June 2014.
