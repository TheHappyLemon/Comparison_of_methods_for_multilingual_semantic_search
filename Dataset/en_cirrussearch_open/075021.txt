Voldemārs Irbe (13 November 1893 – 10 October 1944) was a Latvian pastelist, active in Riga throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Though he was well known for his odd behavior and disheveled appearance, leading him to be nicknamed "Barefoot Irbīte", Irbe's work was acclaimed by the Latvian art world both during and after his lifetime.
