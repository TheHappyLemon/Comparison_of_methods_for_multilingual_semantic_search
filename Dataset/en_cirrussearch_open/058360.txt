Espresso (/ɛˈsprɛsoʊ/ , Italian: [eˈsprɛsso]) is a coffee-brewing method in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Originating from Italy, the French also made significant contributions via the invention of coffee makers, predecessors of today's espresso machines. Espresso can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees. It is one of the world's most popular coffee brewing methods.[citation needed] Numerous espresso-based drinks exist, often blending in milk.
