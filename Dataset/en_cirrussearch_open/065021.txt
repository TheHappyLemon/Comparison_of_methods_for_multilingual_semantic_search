The Kyrgyz Ala-Too (Kyrgyz: Кыргыз Ала-Тоосу, romanized: Kyrgyz Ala-Toosu, [qɯrˈɣɯz ɑlɑˈtoːsu]; Kazakh: Қырғыз Алатауы, romanized: Qyrǵyz Alataýy) also known as Kyrgyz Alatau, Kyrgyz Range, and Alexander Range (until 1933) is a large range in the North Tien-Shan. It stretches for a total length of 454 km from the west-end of Issyk-Kul to the town Taraz in Kazakhstan. It runs in the east–west direction, separating Chüy Valley from Kochkor Valley, Suusamyr Valley, and Talas Valley. Talas Ala-Too Range adjoins the Kyrgyz Ala-Too in vicinity of Töö Ashuu Pass. The western part of Kyrgyz Ala-Too serves as a natural border between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Parts of the range are contained within Ala Archa National Park, a popular alpine recreation area.
