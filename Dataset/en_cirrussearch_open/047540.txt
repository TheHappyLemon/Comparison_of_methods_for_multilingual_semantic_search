The anti-cosmopolitan campaign (Russian: Борьба с космополитизмом, Bor'ba s kosmopolitizmom) was an anti-Western campaign in the Soviet Union which began in late 1948 and has been widely described as a thinly disguised antisemitic purge. A large number of Jews were persecuted as Zionists or rootless cosmopolitans.
