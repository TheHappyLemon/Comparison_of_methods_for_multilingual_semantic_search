Hungary first participated at the Olympic Games at the inaugural 1896 Games, and has sent athletes to compete in most Summer Olympic Games and every Winter Olympic Games since then. The nation was not invited to the 1920 Games for its role in World War I, and was part of the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics. Hungarian athletes have won a total of 511 medals at the Summer Games and 10 medals at the Winter Games, with fencing being the top medal-producing sport. Hungary has won more Summer Olympic medals than any other existing nation never to have hosted the Games, and after overtaking Finland at the 2020 Olympic Games, it is now the country with the highest number of gold medals won per capita (not counting microstates with less than 1 million inhabitants). At the 1956 and 1980 Winter Olympics, all participating Hungarian athletes won medals. The National Olympic Committee for Hungary is the Hungarian Olympic Committee, and was created and recognized in 1895.
