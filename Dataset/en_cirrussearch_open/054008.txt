Nicotine pouches, also called modern oral nicotine products, are white pouches containing nicotine among other ingredients. They do not include tobacco leaf, dust, or stem. The nicotine may either be derived from tobacco plants or may be synthetic. Nicotine pouches are described as either similar to or a tobacco-free version of snus. To use a nicotine pouch, the user puts a pouch between their lip and gum, and leaves it there while the nicotine and taste is being released. When finished, the pouch is disposed of. Many brands have a storage area in the top case (a catch lid) where used pouches can be kept if no trash can is readily available. The small pouches differ from chewing tobacco in that the user does not need to spit, since the contents of the pouches stay inside the pouches during use. No combustion is involved during use. There is limited independent testing of the constituents, exposure, or biomarkers of effects for nicotine pouches, although independent research is now emerging. The pouches are sold in an array of flavors. Many of the brands of nicotine pouches are made by major tobacco companies (e.g., Swedish Match makes Zyn and Volt, British American Tobacco makes Lyft and Velo, Imperial Tobacco makes Skruf and ZoneX, Japan Tobacco International makes Nordic Spirit, Philip Morris International makes Shiro, and Altria owns 100% of On!). In December 2020 and April 2021, Altria subsidiaries closed transactions to acquire the remaining 20% of the global On! business for a total of approximately $250 million.
