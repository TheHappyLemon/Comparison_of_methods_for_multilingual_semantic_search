The urethra (pl.: urethras or urethrae) is a tube that connects the mammalian urinary bladder to the urinary meatus. Male and female placental mammals release urine through the urethra during urination, but males also release semen through the urethra during ejaculation. The external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination. The internal sphincter, formed by the involuntary smooth muscles lining the bladder neck and urethra, receives its nerve supply by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. The internal sphincter is present both in males and females.
