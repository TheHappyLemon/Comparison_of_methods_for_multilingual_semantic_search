György Gordon Bajnai (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈɡordon ˈbɒjnɒi]; born 5 March 1968) is a Hungarian entrepreneur and economist, who served as the Prime Minister of Hungary from 2009 to 2010. Prior to that, he functioned as Minister of Local Government and Regional Development from 2007 to 2008, then as Minister of National Development and Economy from 2008 to 2009. In March 2009, following Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány's announced resignation, Bajnai was nominated by the ruling Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) to become Hungary's next head of government. Bajnai became prime minister when the parliament passed a constructive motion of no-confidence against Ferenc Gyurcsány on 14 April 2009. He held the office until the formation of the Second Orbán Government following the 2010 parliamentary election. Returning to politics, Bajnai established Together 2014, a coalition of left-wing and liberal political movements and civil organizations, in October 2012. The movement would have been an umbrella organization of centre-left parties to contrast Orbán's Fidesz in the 2014 parliamentary election with Bajnai as its prime minister-candidate, but negotiations have failed with the other opposition parties. Thereafter, the Together movement transformed itself into party on 8 March 2013, and Bajnai had gradually marginalized in the upcoming months. He retired from politics after the 2014 parliamentary and European Parliament elections.
