The ruble or rouble (Russian: рубль, romanized: rublʹ; symbol: ₽; abbreviation: руб or р. in Cyrillic, Rub in Latin; ISO code: RUB) is the currency of the Russian Federation. The ruble is subdivided into 100 kopecks (sometimes written as copeck or kopek; Russian: копе́йка, romanized: kopeyka, pl. копе́йки, kopeyki). It is used in Russia as well as in the parts of Ukraine under Russian military occupation and in Russian-occupied parts of Georgia. The ruble was the currency of the Russian Empire and of the Soviet Union (as the Soviet ruble). In 1992, the currency imagery underwent a redesign as a result of the fall of the Soviet Union. The first Russian ruble (code: RUR) replaced the Soviet ruble (code: SUR) in September 1993 at par. On 1 January 1998, preceding the Russian financial crisis, the ruble was redenominated with the new code "RUB" and was exchanged at the rate of 1 RUB = 1,000 RUR.
