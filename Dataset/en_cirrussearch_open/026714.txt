RazakSAT is a Malaysian Earth observation satellite carrying a high-resolution camera. It was launched into low Earth orbit on 14 July 2009. It was placed in a near-equatorial orbit that presents many imaging opportunities for the equatorial region. It weighs over three times as much as TiungSAT-1 and carries a high-resolution Earth observation camera. Developed in conjunction with the Satrec Initiative, the satellite's low inclination (9 degrees) brought it over Malaysia a dozen or more times per day. This was intended to provide greatly increased coverage of Malaysia compared to most other Earth observation satellites. An audit report released in October 2011 revealed that the satellite had failed after one year of operation. RazakSAT was the only operational satellite to be put into orbit by SpaceX's Falcon 1.
