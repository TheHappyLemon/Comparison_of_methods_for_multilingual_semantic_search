Denmark first participated at the Olympic Games at the inaugural 1896 Games, and has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the sparsely attended 1904 Games. Denmark has also participated in the Winter Olympic Games several times since 1948, including every Games since 1988. The top medal-producing sport for Denmark is sailing. Denmark has won only a single medal at the Winter Games, in curling at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The National Olympic Committee for Denmark was created in 1905.
