Edgeøya (Norwegian: [ˈɛdʒˌœ͡ʏɑ]), anglicised as Edge Island, is a Norwegian island located in southeast of the Svalbard archipelago; with an area of 5,073 square kilometres (1,960 sq mi), it is the third-largest island in this archipelago. An Arctic island, it forms part of the Søraust-Svalbard Nature Reserve, home to polar bears and reindeer. An ice field covers its eastern side. The island takes its name from Thomas Edge (died 1624), an English merchant and whaler. It is seldom[quantify] visited today and development of tourist facilities is forbidden by law because of its nature reserve status.
