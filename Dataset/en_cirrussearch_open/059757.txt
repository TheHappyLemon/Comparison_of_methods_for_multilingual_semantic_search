Avraham Stern (Hebrew: אברהם שטרן, Avraham Shtern; December 23, 1907 – February 12, 1942), alias Yair (Hebrew: יאיר), was one of the leaders of the Jewish paramilitary organization Irgun. In September 1940, he founded a breakaway militant Zionist group named Lehi, called the "Stern Gang" by the British authorities and by the mainstream in the Yishuv Jewish establishment. The group referred to its members as terrorists and admitted to having carried out terrorist attacks. Stern's legacy is controversial due to his organization unsuccessfully attempting to form an alliance with Nazi Germany against the British during World War II. He was captured and killed by British colonial police in 1942.
