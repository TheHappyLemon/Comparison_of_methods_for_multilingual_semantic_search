Jetro Danovich Sexer Willems (born 30 March 1994) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a left wing-back or left-back for Eredivisie club Heracles Almelo. Willems represented the Netherlands national team at UEFA Euro 2012; he played in the Netherlands' opening match of the tournament at the age of 18 years and 71 days, making him the youngest player ever to play in the UEFA European Championship at the time. The record has since been broken by Jude Bellingham, who represented England at UEFA Euro 2020.
