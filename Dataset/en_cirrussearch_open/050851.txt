The Schlossberg (German: Schloßberg, lit. 'Castle Mountain') is a tree-clad hill and the site of a fortress in the centre of the city of Graz, Austria. The hill, at 473 metres (1,552 ft) above sea level, is now a public park and affords extensive views of the city. It is the site of several entertainment venues, cafés, and restaurants, and is managed by Holding Graz, the city-owned utility company.
