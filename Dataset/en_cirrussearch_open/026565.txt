Robert Pflug (Latvian: Roberts Pflūgs; 1 May 1832 – 30 November 1885) was a Baltic German architect. Robert August Pflug was born in Saint Petersburg as the son of a merchant. He studied at the Technological Institute in Saint Petersburg between 1846 and 1850 and thereafter at the Imperial Academy of Arts. In 1860 he went on a study trip to Germany and Italy.
