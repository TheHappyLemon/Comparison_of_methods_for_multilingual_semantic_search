He played ten seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens, Calgary Flames, Florida Panthers, St. Louis Blues, and Dallas Stars from 1995 to 2004. A second round selection of the Canadiens, 33rd overall, at the 1992 NHL Entry Draft, Bure appeared in one NHL All-Star Game, in 2000. He led the Flames in scoring with 35 goals and 75 points in 1999–2000, a season in which he and brother Pavel combined to set an NHL record for goals by a pair of siblings with 93. Bure left his home in the Soviet Union in 1991 to play junior hockey in the Western Hockey League (WHL) for the Spokane Chiefs. A two-time WHL all-star, he was the first Russian player in the league's history. Internationally, he represented Russia on numerous occasions. He was a member of the bronze medal-winning squad at the 1994 World Junior Championship and was a two-time medalist at the Winter Olympics. Bure and the Russians won the silver medal in 1998 and bronze in 2002. Back and hip injuries led to Bure's retirement from hockey in 2005. He now operates Bure Family Wines in St. Helena, California with his wife, actress Candace Cameron Bure, to whom he has been married since 1996.
