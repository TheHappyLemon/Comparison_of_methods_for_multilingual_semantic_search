Lake Garda (Italian: Lago di Garda, Italian: [ˈlaːɡo di ˈɡarda], or (Lago) Benaco, Italian: [beˈnaːko]; Eastern Lombard: Lach de Garda; Venetian: Ƚago de Garda) is the largest lake in Italy. It is a popular holiday location in northern Italy, between Brescia and Milan to the west, and Verona and Venice to the east. The lake cuts into the edge of the Italian Alps, particularly the Alpine sub-ranges of the Garda Mountains and the Brenta Group. Glaciers formed this alpine region at the end of the last ice age. The lake and its shoreline are divided between the provinces of Brescia (to the south-west), Verona (south-east) and Trentino (north).
