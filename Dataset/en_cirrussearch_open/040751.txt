The European Youth Chess Championship is organized by the European Chess Union (ECU) in groups under 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 years old. The first tournament was held in 1991, and the under 8 category was introduced in 2007. Until 2002 there was also a tournament for the under 20 group (see European Junior Chess Championship). There are also specific tournaments for girls only, in the same age categories.
