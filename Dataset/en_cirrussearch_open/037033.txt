Ivanka Trump (/ɪˈvɑːŋkə/; born October 30, 1981) is an American businesswoman who is the second-born child of Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, and his first wife, Ivana, as well as the elder of his two daughters. She was a senior advisor in his administration (2017–2021), and also was the director of the Office of Economic Initiatives and Entrepreneurship. Trump was an executive vice president of her family-owned Trump Organization. She was also a boardroom judge on her father's TV show, The Apprentice. Starting in March 2017, Trump left the Trump Organization to become a senior adviser in her father's presidential administration alongside her husband Jared Kushner. While serving in the White House, she continued to operate her clothing brand business until July 2018, which raised ethics concerns, specifically conflicts of interest. She was part of the president's inner circle prior to becoming an official employee in his administration.
