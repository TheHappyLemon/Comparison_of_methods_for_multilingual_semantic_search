The Alash Autonomy (Kazakh: Алаш Автономиясы, romanized: Alaş Avtonomiasy, Kazakh pronunciation: [ɑlɑɕ ɑftonomɪjɑsɯ]; Russian: Алашская автономия, Alashskaya avtonomiya), also known as Alash Orda (Kazakh: Алаш Орда, romanized: Alaş Orda; Russian: Алаш-Орда, romanized: Alash-Orda) was an unrecognized Kazakh provisional government, or proto-state, located in Central Asia and was part of the Russian Republic, and then Soviet Russia. The Alash Autonomy was founded in 1917 by Kazakh elites, and disestablished after the Bolsheviks banned the ruling Alash party. The goal of the party was to obtain autonomy within Russia, and to form a national, democratic state. The political entity bordered Russian territories to the north and west, the Turkestan Autonomy to the south, and China to the east.
