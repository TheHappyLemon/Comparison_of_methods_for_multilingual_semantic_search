Mount Terror (77°31′S 168°32′E﻿ / ﻿77.517°S 168.533°E﻿ / -77.517; 168.533) is an extinct volcano about 3,230 metres (10,600 ft) high on Ross Island, Antarctica, about 20 nautical miles (37 km; 23 mi) eastward of Mount Erebus. Mount Terror was named in 1841 by Sir James Clark Ross for his second ship, HMS Terror. The captain of Terror was Francis Crozier, a close friend of Ross for whom the nearby Cape Crozier is named.[citation needed]
