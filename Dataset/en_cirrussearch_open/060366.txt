Zachary Martin Hyman (born June 9, 1992) is a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger for the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously played for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Hockey Canada named him the 2011 Canadian Junior Hockey League Player of the Year. In 2013, Hyman represented Canada at the 2013 Maccabiah Games in Israel, where he won a gold medal. During the 2014–15 season, Hyman won a number of awards, including being named the University of Michigan's Athlete of the Year and a First Team All-American, and was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award. Hyman was selected by the Florida Panthers in the 5th round of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. However, the parties were unable to agree on a contract, and Hyman's rights were traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs on June 19, 2015. During his rookie 2016–17 season, he set a new Maple Leafs record for most short-handed goals scored by a rookie in a season with four, and tied the team record for the most consecutive games with an assist by a rookie at six games. Hyman is also an award-winning, best-selling author of children's literature, under contract with Penguin Random House.
