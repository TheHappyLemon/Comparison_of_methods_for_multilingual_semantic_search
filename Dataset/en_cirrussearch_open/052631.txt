The men's 100 metre freestyle was one of the four swimming events on the Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics programme. The 100 metre freestyle race was the first of the swimming events. Six swimmers entered the race: the two competitors from Austria-Hungary finished first and second, though there is no record of the places of the other four competitors. Alfréd Hajós of Hungary beat Otto Herschmann of Austria by half a metre in a close contest, with the other swimmers far behind. While the Hungarian flag was hoisted, the band began to play the Austrian anthem (Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser) until the Hungarian sang the Hungarian anthem (Himnusz).
