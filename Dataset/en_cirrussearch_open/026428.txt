The Republic of San Marino comprises nine castelli (lit.â€‰'castles') as its first-level administrative divisions. Each castle is led by a Castle Captain (Italian: Capitano di Castello) and a Castle Council (Giunta di Castello), elected every five years. Like Italian comuni, each castello has a capital (capoluogo), with other population centres sorted into curazie (equivalent to Italian frazioni).
