Azerbaijan is administratively divided into 69 districts (rayon) and 11 cities (şəhər) that are subordinate to the Republic. Out of these, 7 districts and 1 city are located within the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The districts are further divided into municipalities (bələdiyyə). Additionally, the districts of Azerbaijan are grouped into 14 Economic Regions (İqtisadi Rayon). On 7 July 2021, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed Decree "On the new division of economic regions in the Republic of Azerbaijan".
