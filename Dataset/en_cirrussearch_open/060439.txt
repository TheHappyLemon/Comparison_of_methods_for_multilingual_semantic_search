Batman: The Killing Joke is a 2016 American adult animated superhero film produced by Warner Bros. Animation and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the 27th of the DC Universe Animated Original Movies, based on the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland. The film is directed by Sam Liu, written by Brian Azzarello and stars the voices of Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Tara Strong, and Ray Wise. Like the novel, the film follows the Joker,Batman's archnemesis, and his efforts to drive police commissioner James Gordon insane as Batman works desperately to stop him. Development of a film adaptation of the novel began in 2009. Production was stalled due to the under-performance of DC's live-action adaptation of Moore's Watchmen. In 2011, Hamill expressed interest in reprising his role of the Joker for the adaptation, resulting in a fan campaign for its production. In 2015, producer Bruce Timm confirmed that an animated feature based on the book was in development. It is the first Batman film and Warner Bros. Animation film to be rated R by the MPAA. Batman: The Killing Joke premiered at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, 2016. The film was originally intended to be released directly on home video but, due to its popularity, was instead released simultaneously in theaters and digitally on July 25, 2016, for a special one-night event. It released on DVD and Blu-ray August 2, 2016. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with the bulk of the criticism aimed towards the first half of the film. It grossed $4.4 million worldwide and became the 13th highest-grossing R-rated animated film worldwide.
