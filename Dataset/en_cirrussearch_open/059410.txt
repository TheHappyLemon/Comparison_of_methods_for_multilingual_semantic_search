Obstacle jumping was one of five equestrian competitions held in late May and early June 1900 at the International Horse Show in Paris. The event was part of the Exposition Universelle, and later classified as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics. It was similar to the modern show jumping event. 45 competitors entered, though only 37 competed, with some information unknown. The event was won by Aim√© Haegeman of Belgium, with his countryman Georges Van Der Poele taking second and Louis de Champsavin of France in third.
