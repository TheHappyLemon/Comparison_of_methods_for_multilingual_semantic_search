Porin Ässät (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈporin æsːæt]; Finnish for Pori Aces), officially named Hockey Club Ässät Pori and colloquially known as Pata, is a professional ice hockey club based in Pori, Finland. It competes in the SM-liiga, the highest-ranking league of ice hockey in Finland. Since 1971, Ässät has played its games in the Isomäki Ice Hall. The team was founded in 1967 due to a merger of two local sports clubs, Rosenlewin Urheilijat-38 and Porin Karhut. Ässät originally competed in the SM-sarja, which was replaced by the SM-liiga in 1975, making Ässät one of the ten original SM-liiga teams. Ässät was relegated to the I-Divisioona for the 1989–90 season, but it was promoted back to the SM-liiga after just one season. Ässät has won the Kanada-malja championship three times (in 1971, 1978 and 2013); it also won the Finnish Cup once in 1967. Ässät has a total of nine medals in the upper tier of Finnish ice hockey, with four of them being silver and two of them being bronze. Ässät has been awarded the Aaro Kivilinna Memorial Trophy once in the 1979–80 season. Ässät won a European Cup bronze medal in 1979.
