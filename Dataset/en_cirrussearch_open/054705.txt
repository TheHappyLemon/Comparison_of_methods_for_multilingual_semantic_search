The Heiberg Islands, spelt Geyberg, Gejberg or Geiberg (Russian: острова Гейберга; ostrova Geyberga or also острова Акселя Гейберга) is a group of four small islands covered with tundra vegetation and with scattered stones on their shores. They lie in the Kara Sea, between the bleak coast of Siberia's Taymyr Peninsula and Severnaya Zemlya. These islands are between 35 and 45 km (22 and 28 mi) from the continental shore. The Heiberg Islands are covering the entrance to the Vilkitsky Strait from the west. The latitude of this group is 77° 40' N and the longitude 101° 27' E. 77°40′N 101°27′E﻿ / ﻿77.667°N 101.450°E﻿ / 77.667; 101.450 The largest island of the group is only about 5 km (3.1 mi) in length. The sea surrounding the Heiberg Islands is covered with fast ice in the winter, which is long and bitter, and the climate is severe. The surrounding sea is obstructed by pack ice even in the summer, so that these islands are connected with the mainland for most of the year. The Heiberg Islands were named by Fridtjof Nansen after Axel Heiberg, financial director of the Norwegian Ringnes brewery, who was the main financier of the Fram expedition to the Arctic. These Siberian islands should not be confused with Axel Heiberg Island in Canada. This island group belongs to the Krasnoyarsk Krai administrative division of the Russian Federation. It is also part of the Great Arctic State Nature Reserve, the largest nature reserve of Russia.
