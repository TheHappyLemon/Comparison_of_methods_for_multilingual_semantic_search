Trinculo /ˈtrɪŋkjʊloʊ/ is a retrograde irregular satellite of Uranus. It was discovered by a group of astronomers led by Holman, et al. on 13 August 2001, and given the temporary designation S/2001 U 1. Confirmed as Uranus XXI, it was named after the drunken jester Trinculo in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Trinculo is the second smallest of Uranus' 27 moons after Ferdinand and is approximately only 18 km wide.
