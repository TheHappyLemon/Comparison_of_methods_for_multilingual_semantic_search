Kristiine is divided into 3 subdistricts (Estonian: asum): Järve Lilleküla Tondi The name of Kristiine originates from the Swedish Queen Christina under whose rule in 1653 the area was divided into 46 pieces (each of them 9 ha) and sold to businessmen and city officials for 100 riksdaler. The whole area was called Christinental (Valley of Christina) and later Kristiine hayfield. The elder of the district is Andrei Novikov (as of September 2013).
