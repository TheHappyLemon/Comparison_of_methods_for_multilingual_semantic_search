Pope Linus (/ˈlaɪnəs/ , Greek: Λῖνος, Linos; died c. AD 76) was the bishop of Rome from c. AD 67 to his death. He is generally regarded as the second Bishop of Rome, after St. Peter. As with all the early popes, he was canonized. According to Irenaeus, Linus is the same person as the one mentioned in the New Testament. Linus is mentioned in the valediction of the Second Epistle to Timothy as being with Paul the Apostle in Rome near the end of Paul's life.
