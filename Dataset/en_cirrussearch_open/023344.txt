The Greater Caucasus is the major mountain range of the Caucasus Mountains. The range stretches for about 1,200 kilometres (750Â mi) from west-northwest to east-southeast, between the Taman Peninsula of the Black Sea to the Absheron Peninsula of the Caspian Sea: from the Western Caucasus in the vicinity of Sochi on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea and reaching nearly to Baku on the Caspian.
