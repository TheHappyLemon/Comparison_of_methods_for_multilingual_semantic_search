"Can't Shake Loose" is a 1983 song from Agnetha Fältskog's solo album, Wrap Your Arms Around Me. It was the third single release in Europe and the first to be issued in the United States and Canada. The song was written by Russ Ballard, who also wrote the successful "I Know There's Something Going On" for Agnetha's ABBA colleague Anni-Frid Lyngstad (Frida). "Can't Shake Loose" proved rather successful on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, where it broke into the Top 30 at No. 29 in November 1983, making it her only Top 40 song in that country. As usual, Fältskog did only limited promotion, although she appeared on American television in August 1983. "Can't Shake Loose" also performed well in Canada, where it reached No. 23. In the UK and Australia, however, the track proved unsuccessful, reaching No. 63 and No. 76, respectively.
