The 2009 UCI World Ranking was the first edition of the ranking system launched by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), replacing the rankings previously part of the UCI ProTour, with which it would be merged in 2011 to form the UCI World Tour. The series started with the Tour Down Under's opening stage on 20 January, and consists of 13 stage races and 11 one-day races, culminating in the Giro di Lombardia on 17 October. All events except the Tour Down Under took place in Europe. The individual ranking was topped by Alberto Contador, who took the lead after his win in the Tour de France and was assured of winning the classification when second-placed Alejandro Valverde was absent from the final race of the series. Contador's Astana team took the team title, with Valverde again second as leader of Caisse d'Epargne, and with a third Spaniard, Samuel SÃ¡nchez, completing the top three in the individual classification, Spain won the national rankings by a wide margin over second placed Italy.
