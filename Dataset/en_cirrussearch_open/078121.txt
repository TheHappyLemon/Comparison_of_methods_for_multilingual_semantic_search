TerreStar-1 is an American communications satellite which was operated by TerreStar Corporation. It was constructed by Space Systems/Loral, based on the LS-1300S bus, and carries E/F band (IEEE S band) transponders which will be used to provide mobile communications to North America. The signals are transmitted by an 18-metre (59 ft) reflector on the satellite. It had a launch mass of 6,910 kilograms (15,230 lb), making it the second most massive single satellite launched into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, and the second largest commercial communications satellite ever built. Its record as the most massive communication satellite was surpassed by Telstar 19V launched on Falcon 9 on July 21, 2018, with a mass of 7,076 kilograms (15,600 lb). TerreStar was launched at 17:52 GMT on July 1, 2009, during a two-hour launch window that opened at 16:13. The launch occurred towards the end of the window due to bad weather in the first hour, followed by two aborted countdowns for launch attempts scheduled at 17:12 and 17:34. The launch was conducted by Arianespace, and used an Ariane 5ECA carrier rocket, flying from ELA-3 at the Guiana Space Centre. After launch, the satellite separated from the carrier rocket into a geosynchronous transfer orbit. It will subsequently raise itself into geostationary orbit by means of its onboard propulsion system. It will be positioned at 111° West longitude, and is expected to operate for 15 years. A second satellite, TerreStar-2 (now EchoStar XXI), is currently under construction and will be used as a ground spare per the Federal Communications Commission guidelines. Following TerreStar's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a movement had been formed by the NGO A Human Right to purchase TerreStar-1 and to use it to provide free basic Internet access to developing countries. The team was looking for US$150,000 in donations to put the first phase of their plan into action. However, after successfully bidding $1.375 billion for the acquisition of the TerreStar-1 satellite in a bankruptcy-court auction Dish Network on August 22, 2011 asked the Federal Communications Commission to let the company use the wireless spectrum of TerreStar to offer its own wireless broadband service. Despite its successful launch and groundbreaking achievements, TerreStar Corporation faced challenges and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In response, a movement led by the NGO A Human Right emerged, seeking to acquire TerreStar-1 and use it to provide free basic Internet access to developing countries. Their ambitious plan aimed to bridge the digital divide and connect underserved communities worldwide. However, Dish Network outbid others in the bankruptcy-court auction, acquiring TerreStar-1 for a staggering $1.375 billion. With this acquisition, Dish Network sought to utilize the satellite's wireless spectrum to offer its own wireless broadband service, marking a strategic move in the highly competitive communications market.
