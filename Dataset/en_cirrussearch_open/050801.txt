Schaerbeek railway station (French: Gare de Schaerbeek) or Schaarbeek railway station (Dutch: Station Schaarbeek) is a railway station in the municipality of Schaerbeek in Brussels, Belgium, opened in 1887. The train services are operated by the National Railway Company of Belgium (NMBS/SNCB). Located to the north-east of Brussels, the station mainly serves trains travelling between central Brussels and Leuven, Antwerp or Brussels Airport-Zaventem. On these routes, it is the first station trains pass through after the North–South connection (Brussels-North, Brussels-Central and Brussels-South stations). Although only local trains stop at Schaerbeek, the station also serves as a terminus for a number of interregional and peak-hour services. As it connects both to the North–South connection and to line 28 through Brussels-West station, it is the point at which trains can be rerouted to reverse direction. The square in front of the station serves as terminus for Brussels tram route 92, as well as bus route 69. Bus routes 58 and 59 also stop there.
