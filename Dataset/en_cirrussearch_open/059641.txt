Beginnings: The Lost Tapes 1988â€“1991 is a compilation album consisting of unreleased recordings of American rapper Tupac Shakur. The album was originally released on April 18, 2000, in bootleg form under the title The Lost Tapes: Circa 1989, but the selling was quickly halted due to not receiving approval from then head of the Tupac estate, Afeni Shakur. The track "Panther Power" was issued on the Resurrection soundtrack before finally receiving the blessing of Afeni Shakur and being reissued in 2007, under Koch and Amaru Entertainment. Produced by Digital Underground and Strictly Dope member Chopmaster J, Beginnings... is a collection of the rapper's earliest songs, created before Shakur began working on his first studio album, 2Pacalypse Now.
