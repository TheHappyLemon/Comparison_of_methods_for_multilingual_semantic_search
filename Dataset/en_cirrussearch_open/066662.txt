Dianthus arenarius, the sand pink, is a species of Dianthus typically found on the shores of the Baltic Sea, although there are populations elsewhere in colder areas of Europe where there are sandy soils. The unimproved species, and at least one cultivar, 'Little Maiden', are available from commercial suppliers.
