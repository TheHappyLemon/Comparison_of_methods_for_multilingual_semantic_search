Her first consistent success on the WTA Tour came in mid-2019 and was highlighted by her first WTA Tour title at the Bucharest Open as well as her top 100 debut. Rybakina made a breakthrough in the 2020 season, during which she led the tour with five finals, including four in her first five events of the year. Rybakina is noted for her excellent serve and can generate high-powered groundstrokes. She plays primarily from the baseline and has good movement for her height.
