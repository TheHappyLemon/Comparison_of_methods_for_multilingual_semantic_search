Al Wakrah (Arabic: الوكرة, romanized: al-Wakra) is the capital city of the Al Wakrah Municipality in Qatar. Al Wakrah's eastern edge touches the shores of the Persian Gulf and Qatar's capital Doha is situated to the city's immediate north. Governed by Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, it was originally a small fishing and pearling village. Over the years, it evolved into a small city with a population of more than 80,000 and is currently considered the second most populous city in Qatar. It has undergone extensive development and growth since the turn of the 21st century while also being steadily encroached on by rapidly expanding Doha from the north. Notable milestones in the city's modern history include the May 2019 inauguration of Al Janoub Stadium, a venue for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, the opening of Al Wakrah Heritage Village in 2016, the Al Wakrah Main Road Project, and the city's integration into the Doha Metro's Red Line.
