The Angry Birds Movie (also known simply as Angry Birds) is a 2016 animated comedy film based on Rovio Entertainment's video game series of the same name, produced by Columbia Pictures and Rovio Animation, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film was directed by Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly (in their feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay written by Jon Vitti and a story by Mikael Hed, Mikko Pöllä, and co-producer John Cohen. It stars the voices of Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Kate McKinnon, Sean Penn, Tony Hale, Keegan-Michael Key, Bill Hader, and Peter Dinklage. The film follows Red (Sudeikis), an outcast in an island of anthropomorphic flightless birds, as he suspects a newly arrived crew of pigs led by Leonard (Hader) of plotting an evil plan, and attempts to put a stop to them with the help of his newfound friends Chuck (Gad) and Bomb (McBride). After the success of the Angry Birds Toons webseries, Rovio subsequently began development on an adaptation of the Angry Birds video game series, and would proceed to make a proper announcement in December 2012. The first image from the film was revealed in October 2014, with Sudeikis, Gad, McBride, Hader, Rudolph Dinklage revealed to be part of its cast at the same time. Rovio and Sony Pictures announced that they would spend roughly €100 million for the marketing and distribution of The Angry Birds Movie, surpassing the €8.5 million budget of Big Game (2014) to become the most expensive Finnish-produced film up to that point. Sony Pictures Imageworks was responsible for handling animation services for the film. The Angry Birds Movie was released in the United States and Canada on May 20, 2016. The film received overall mixed reviews from critics and grossed $352 million worldwide. A sequel, The Angry Birds Movie 2, was released on August 14, 2019, co-produced by Sony Pictures Animation, who were not involved with this film.
