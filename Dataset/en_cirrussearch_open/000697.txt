The Wright Valley (77°31′S 161°50′E﻿ / ﻿77.517°S 161.833°E﻿ / -77.517; 161.833﻿ (Wright Valley)) is a large east–west trending valley, formerly occupied by a glacier but now ice free except for Wright Upper Glacier at its head and Wright Lower Glacier at its mouth, in Victoria Land, Antarctica. It was named by the VUWAE (1958-59) for Sir Charles Wright, for whom the BrAE (1910-13) named the glacier at the mouth of this valley. The Wright Valley is the central one of the three large McMurdo Dry Valleys in the Transantarctic Mountains, located west of McMurdo Sound. Wright Valley contains the Onyx River, the longest river in Antarctica, Lake Brownworth, the origin of the Onyx River, and Lake Vanda, which is fed by the Onyx River. Its southwestern branch, South Fork, is the location of Don Juan Pond. The upland area known as the Labyrinth is at the valley's west end.
