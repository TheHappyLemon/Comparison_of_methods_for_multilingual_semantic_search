The Chukotka Mountains (Russian: Чукотское нагорье, romanized: Chukotskoye Nagorye) or Chukotka Upland (Russian: Чукотская горная страна, romanized: Chukotskaya Gornaya Strana), is a mountainous area in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Far Eastern Federal District, Russia. The ridges of this system are largely barren and desolate. About half of their area is above the Arctic Circle. The climate is one of the harshest in the Russian Federation, with minimum absolute temperatures reaching -73°С. Traditionally Chukchi people lived only in few intermontane areas, such as the Amguema valley that cuts across the vast mountain zone.
