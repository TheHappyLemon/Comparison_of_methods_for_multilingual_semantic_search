His net worth has been estimated at between US$2.1 billion and over US$8.2 billion. In 2015, Forbes named him the richest king in Africa and the fifth wealthiest monarch in the world. Upon ascending to the throne, Mohammed initially introduced a number of reforms and changed the family code, Mudawana, granting women more power. Leaked diplomatic cables from WikiLeaks in 2010 led to allegations of corruption in the court of Mohammed, implicating him and his closest advisors. In 2011, protests considered part of the wider Arab Spring occurred against alleged government corruption. In response, Mohammed enacted several reforms and introduced a new constitution. These reforms were passed by a public referendum on 1 July 2011.
