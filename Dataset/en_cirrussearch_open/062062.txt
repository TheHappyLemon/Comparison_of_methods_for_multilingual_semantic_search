Draymond Jamal Green (born March 4, 1990) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Green, who plays primarily at the power forward position, is a four-time NBA champion, a four-time NBA All-Star, a two-time member of the All-NBA Team, and a two-time Olympic gold medalist. Considered one of the greatest defensive players in the league, he is an eight-time All-Defensive Team, 2017 NBA Defensive Player of the Year and led the league in steals. Green has been a runner-up for the Defensive Player of the Year Award three times in his career. Green grew up in Saginaw, Michigan, and he played college basketball for the Michigan State Spartans, helping them earn two Final Four appearances and a Big Ten tournament championship in 2012. Throughout his four-year college career, Green earned conference and national honors, including Big Ten Conference Sixth Man of the Year as a sophomore and consensus All-American and NABC National Player of the Year honors as a senior. He was drafted 35th overall in the 2012 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors and later played a key role on the Warriors' 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022 championship teams. Green, who often plays significant minutes for the Warriors as an undersized center in their "Death Lineup", has been cited as one of the leaders in an emerging trend in the NBA of versatile frontcourt players capable of playing and defending multiple positions as well as making plays for teammates. He is considered one of the best passers and defensive players of the 2010s, known for his steals, shot-blocking, rebounding, and overall defensive play. Green has also been criticized for his on-court conduct and for physically aggressive acts which have been perceived by many as "dirty", unsportsmanlike, and sometimes dangerous. Several ejections and suspensions during the 2023 calendar year led to Green being suspended by the NBA for over a month.
