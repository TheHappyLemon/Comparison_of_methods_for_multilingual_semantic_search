Fudbalski klub Čukarički (Serbian Cyrillic: Фудбалски клуб Чукарички) is a Serbian professional football club from Belgrade, more precisely from the Čukarica municipality, that currently plays in the Serbian SuperLiga, the top tier of Serbian football. Founded in 1926, the club spent the first years of its existence in the amateur field. In the days of Yugoslavia, Čukarički played predominantly in the lower divisions of the country. The first notable achievements for the club were in the seasons of 1971–72, when they first reached the Yugoslav Second League, and 1993-94, when they reached, for the first time ever in the club's history, the national top tier of football, the Yugoslav First League, the first tier in the newly created Serbia and Montenegro.
