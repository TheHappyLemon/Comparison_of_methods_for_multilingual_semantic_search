The Dutch Wikipedia (Dutch: Nederlandstalige Wikipedia) is the Dutch-language edition of the free online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. It was founded on 19 June 2001. As of April 2024, the Dutch Wikipedia is the sixth-largest Wikipedia edition, with 2,154,897 articles. It was the fourth Wikipedia edition to exceed one million articles, after the English, German, and French editions. Many articles however have been created by bots and are only a few lines of length, the article depth is very low. In April 2016, 1154 active editors made at least five edits in that month. Dutch is consistently the most popular Wikipedia in the Netherlands. In Belgium, Dutch is sometimes the most popular Wikipedia, but French is usually the most popular; in Suriname however, the only Dutch-speaking country outside Europe, Dutch Wikipedia is second after English. In Curaçao and Aruba, as well in Caribbean Netherlands, it has a presence, but has fewer pageviews than English.
