Gouda (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɣʌudaː] ) is a city and municipality in the west of the Netherlands, between Rotterdam and Utrecht, in the province of South Holland. Gouda has a population of 75,000 and is famous for its Gouda cheese, stroopwafels, many grachten, smoking pipes, and its 15th-century city hall. Its array of historic churches and other buildings makes it a very popular day-trip destination. In the Middle Ages the Van der Goude [nl] family founded a settlement at the location of the current city and built a fortified castle alongside the banks of the Gouwe River, from which the family and the city took their names. Locals long called the settlement Ter Goude, or Tergou or Tergouw [nl] for short. The area, originally marshland, developed over the course of two centuries.[timeframe?] By 1225, a canal was linked to the Gouwe and its estuary became a harbour. in 1272 Floris V, Count of Holland granted the town city rights.
