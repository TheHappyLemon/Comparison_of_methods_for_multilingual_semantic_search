The Czechoslovakia women's national basketball team (Czech: Československá ženská basketbalová reprezentace, Slovak: Česko-slovenské národné basketbalové družstvo žien) was the women's basketball side that represented Czechoslovakia in international competitions. After the country was peacefully dissolved in 1993, the team was succeeded by separate Czech and Slovak teams.
