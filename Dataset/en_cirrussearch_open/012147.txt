The Music Moves Europe Award, also known as the MME Award, is an annual prize recognizing the success of ten emerging artists or groups who reached audiences outside their own countries with their first internationally released album in the past year. The prize was known as the European Border Breakers Award (EBBA) until 2019, and the Music Moves Europe Talent Award (MMETA) until 2022.
