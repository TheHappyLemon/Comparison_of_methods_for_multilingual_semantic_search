The 2022 IIHF World Championship Division III was an international ice hockey tournament run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The Group A tournament was held in Kockelscheuer, Luxembourg from 3 to 8 April and the Group B tournament in Cape Town, South Africa from 13 to 18 March 2022. After the tournament was cancelled the two previous years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all teams stayed put in their divisions. The United Arab Emirates secured the top spot in Group A and were promoted to Division II, while South Africa won the Group B tournament and were promoted to Group A. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus were suspended from the 2022 and 2023 editions of the World Championship. In order to fill each group of the World Championships back to their normal amount of teams, the IIHF made the decision following the tournament not to relegate Luxembourg or Bosnia and Herzegovina, who finished last in Groups A and B respectively, but instead to promote Turkey and Thailand, the runners-up of each group.
