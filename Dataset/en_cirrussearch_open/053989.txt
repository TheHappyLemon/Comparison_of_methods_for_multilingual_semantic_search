Jean-Marc Bosman (French: [ʒɑ̃ maʁk bɔsman]; born 30 October 1964) is a Belgian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. His judicial challenge of the football transfer rules led to the Bosman ruling in 1995. This landmark judgement, which was handed down by the European Court of Justice, completely changed the way footballers are employed, allowing professional players in the European Union to move freely to another club at the end of their contract with their present team.
