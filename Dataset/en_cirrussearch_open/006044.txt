.ne is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Niger. Unrelated to the .ne top-level domain, "ne" is sometimes used as a second-level domain within other country-code domains, in which registrants may register second-level domains of the form .ne.xx, where xx is the ccTLD. Two examples are Japan (.ne.jp) and South Korea. .ne domain names can be registered via certain accredited registrars.
