.na is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Namibia corresponding to the two letter code from the ISO-3166 standard. The registry accredits both Namibian and foreign registrars. Registrars access the Registry and register domains using either a web-based GUI or the industry standard EPP protocol. The domain was established on 8 May 1991. The ccTLD manager is NA-NiC (Namibian Network Information Centre). The Namibian Parliament passed a Communications Act in 2009 containing various provisions regarding the ccTLD; however, as of the end of 2017, they had not yet entered into force. Registrations are available at both the second level or at the third level beneath various names that include some apparently redundant choices (e.g., both .co.na and .com.na for commercial entities).
