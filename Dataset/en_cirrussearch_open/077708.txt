.lt is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Lithuania. Following the University of Oslo's request to the Norwegian government that a Lithuanian Internet ccTLD be established, .lt was launched on June 3 1992. Domain name registration was initially limited to the academic community, state institutions and companies, with the first second-level domains—mii.lt, ktu.lt, and vu.lt—being registered in 1993. In 1994 administration of the .lt ccTLD was transferred from Oslo University to the Kaunas University of Technology.
