Yoh Asakura (Japanese: 麻倉 葉, Hepburn: Asakura Yō) is a fictional character and protagonist of the manga series Shaman King created by Hiroyuki Takei. Yoh is a shaman with a lazy demeanor who is accompanied by a six-hundred-year-old samurai ghost, Amidamaru. When first introduced, Yoh appears as a young teenager who wishes to become the "Shaman King", the world's ruler, in an attempt to grant his own wish of living a peaceful life. However, as he befriends more people in the shaman fighting tournament to become the Shaman King, it is revealed Yoh has a twin brother named Hao Asakura whom he wishes to redeem. Yoh also appears in the prequel Shaman King Zero and in the sequel Shaman King Flowers, with the former being a story about his childhood and the latter being demoting him to cameo appearances as he travels around the world as his son, Hana, takes the leading role. In the first series, his Japanese voice actress is Yūko Satō, and his English dub voice is provided by Sebastian Arcelus. In the second anime adaptation, Yoh's Japanese voice actress is Yōko Hikasa with his English dub voice in that series being provided by Abby Trott. He also appears as the protagonist in all the Shaman King video games and appears in multiple crossover fighting games alongside other characters that appeared in the same magazine that Shaman King debuted. Critical reception to Yoh has been mostly positive, based on his interactions with other characters. The pacifism Yoh displays was praised for giving him a more unique trait as he helps to redeem enemies or avoid violence. Merchandising based on him has also been released.
