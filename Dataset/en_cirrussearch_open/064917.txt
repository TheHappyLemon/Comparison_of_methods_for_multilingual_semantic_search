Satakunta (in both Finnish and Swedish, Finnish pronunciation: [ˈs̠ɑt̪ɑˌkun̪t̪ɑ]) is a region (maakunta / landskap) of Finland, part of the former Western Finland Province. It borders the regions of Southwest Finland, Pirkanmaa, South Ostrobothnia and Ostrobothnia. The capital city of the region is Pori. The name of the region literally means hundred. The historical province of the same name was a larger area within Finland, covering modern Satakunta as well as much of Pirkanmaa.
