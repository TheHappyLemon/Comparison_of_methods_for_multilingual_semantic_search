Žvėrynas (literally the menagerie) is one of the older neighbourhoods and smallest elderships in Vilnius, Lithuania. According to the 2011 census, 11,079 people live within its 2.6 km² area. It lies on the banks of the Neris River, and is situated to the west of the Lithuanian Parliament building. The river surrounds it from three sides and isolates it from the city. On the other side of the river, to the northwest, lies Vingis Park. Initially, it was a private out of town hunting area until the end of the 19th century, later it was developed as a resort and therefore many decorated wooden houses have survived from these times.
