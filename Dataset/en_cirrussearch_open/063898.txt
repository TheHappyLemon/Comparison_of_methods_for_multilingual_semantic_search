Ardee (/ˈɑːrdiː/; Irish: Baile Átha Fhirdhia, pronounced [ˈbˠalʲə aːhə ˈɪɾʲjiə]) is a town and townland in County Louth, Ireland. It is located at the intersection of the N2, N52, and N33 roads. The town shows evidence of development from the thirteenth century onward but as a result of the continued development of the town since then much of the fabric of the medieval town has been removed. Ardee is on the banks of the River Dee and is equidistant between the county's two biggest towns - approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Dundalk and Drogheda, while it is also close to Slane and Carrickmacross. In the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census, the population of Ardee increased by approximately 30%, from 3,791 to 4,928 inhabitants.
