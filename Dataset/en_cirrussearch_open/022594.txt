In contemporary history, the third millennium is the current millennium in the Anno Domini or Common Era, under the Gregorian calendar. It began on 1 January 2001 (MMI) and will end on 31 December 3000 (MMM), spanning the 21st to 30th centuries. Ongoing futures studies seek to understand what will likely continue and what could plausibly change in this period and beyond.
