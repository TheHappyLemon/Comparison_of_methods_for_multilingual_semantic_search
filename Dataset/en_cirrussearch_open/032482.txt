Resurs-P No.2 is a Russian commercial Earth observation satellite capable of acquiring high-resolution imagery (resolution up to 1.0 m). The spacecraft will be operated by Roscosmos along with the Resurs-P No.1 satellite. The satellite is designed for multi-spectral remote sensing of the Earth's surface aimed at acquiring high-quality visible images in near real-time as well as on-line data delivery via radio link and providing a wide range of consumers with value-added processed data. Additionally the satellite carries the Nuklon high-energy particle detector developed by the Moscow State University for detecting cosmic radiation.
