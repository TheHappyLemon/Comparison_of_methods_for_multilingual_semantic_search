Club Atlético Banfield is an Argentine sports club based in the Banfield city of Greater Buenos Aires. It was founded on 21 January 1896, by the British–origin inhabitants of that city (mostly English, and some Scots and Irish). The club is mostly known for its football teams, that currently competes in Primera División, the top division of the Argentine football league system. In 2009 Banfield obtained their first Primera División title after winning the 2009 Apertura. Banfield had previously achieved a national cup title in 1920, when the club won the Copa de Honor Municipalidad de Buenos Aires after beating Boca Juniors 2–1. The club also won 10 titles in Second Division. The so-called "Southern Classic" ("Clásico del Sur"), considered a modern classic in Argentine football, is contested against Lanús, and thanks to the good results of both in recent years it is also considered one of the most attractive clásicos of Primera División. They also have rivalries with Los Andes, Temperley, Talleres (RdE), Quilmes. In October 2018, with the appointment of Lucía Barbuto, the club became the first in the history of the Argentine highest division to elect a woman as president. Banfield also has a women's football section, which started in 1997 and affiliated to AFA in 2018. Other sports practiced at the club include boxing, chess, field hockey, futsal, gymnastics, handball, roller skating, taekwondo, tennis and volleyball.
