Chersky (also anglicized Cherskiy) (Russian: Че́рский; Yakut: Черскэй, Çerskey) is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) and the administrative center of Nizhnekolymsky District of the Sakha Republic, Russia, located on the Kolyma River, 1,920 kilometers (1,190 mi) east from Yakutsk, the capital of the republic. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 2,857. It was previously known as Nizhniye Kresty (until 1963). In 1989 the population of Chersky peaked on 11,176 inhabitants; however, like most Soviet settlements in the Arctic, it has been largely abandoned after the dissolution of the Soviet Union as most of its residents left. A similar depopulation happened in Magadan Oblast and Chukotka, and in lighter scale in the Russian Far East.
