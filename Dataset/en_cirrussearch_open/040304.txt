Business marketing is a marketing practice of individuals or organizations (including commercial businesses, governments, and institutions). It allows them to sell products or services to other companies or organizations that resell them, use them in their products or services, or use them to support their works. It is a way to promote business and improve profit too. Marketing can be broken down into many sections such as business-to-business marketing, business-to-consumer marketing, as well as business-to-developer marketing. However, business marketing is typically associated with business-to-business marketing.
