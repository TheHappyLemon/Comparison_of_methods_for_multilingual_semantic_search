An arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference from any succeeding term to its preceding term remains constant throughout the sequence. The constant difference is called common difference of that arithmetic progression. For instance, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, . . . is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2. If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is a1{\displaystyle a_{1}} and the common difference of successive members is d{\displaystyle d}, then the n{\displaystyle n}-th term of the sequence (an{\displaystyle a_{n}}) is given by: an=a1+(nâˆ’1)d{\displaystyle a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)d} A finite portion of an arithmetic progression is called a finite arithmetic progression and sometimes just called an arithmetic progression. The sum of a finite arithmetic progression is called an arithmetic series.
