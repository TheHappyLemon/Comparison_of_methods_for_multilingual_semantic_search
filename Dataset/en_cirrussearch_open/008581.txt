The East Germany national football team, recognised as Germany DR by FIFA, represented East Germany in men's international football, playing as one of three post-war German teams, along with Saarland and West Germany. After German reunification in 1990, the Deutscher Fußball Verband der DDR (DFV, English: German Football Association of the GDR), and with it the East German team, joined the Deutscher Fußball Bund (DFB) and the West Germany national football team that had just won the World Cup.
