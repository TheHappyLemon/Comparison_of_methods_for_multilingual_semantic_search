The Dnieper Balts were a subgroup of the Balts that lived in the Dnieper river basin for millennia until the Late Middle Ages, when they were partly destroyed and partly assimilated by the Slavs by the 13th century. To the north and northeast of the Dnieper Balts were the Volga Finns, and to the southeast and south were the ancient Iranians, the Scythians. The Dnieper Balts have been studied by many researchers, such as the Lithuanian linguist Kazimieras BÅ«ga, the German linguist Max Vasmer, and the Russian linguists Vladimir Toporov, and Oleg Trubachyov.
