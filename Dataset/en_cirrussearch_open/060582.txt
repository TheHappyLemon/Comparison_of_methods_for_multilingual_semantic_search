The Queen Elizabeth Islands (French: Îles de la Reine-Élisabeth) are the northernmost cluster of islands in Canada's Arctic Archipelago, split between Nunavut and the Northwest Territories in Northern Canada. The Queen Elizabeth Islands contain approximately 14% of the global glacier and ice cap area (excluding the inland and shelf ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica). The southern islands are called the Parry Islands or Parry Archipelago.
