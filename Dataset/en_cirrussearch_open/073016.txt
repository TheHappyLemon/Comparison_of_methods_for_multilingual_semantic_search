The Women's 10 metre air rifle event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on August 9 at the Beijing Shooting Range Hall. It was the first medal awarded at the 2008 Olympic Games. Kateřina Emmons, who won a bronze medal in Athens four years earlier (then known by her maiden name Kůrková), now went all the way to a gold medal, after becoming the first shooter ever to achieve maximum qualification score (400) in an Olympic air rifle competition. The event consisted of two rounds: a qualifier and a final. In the qualifier, each shooter fired 40 shots with an air rifle at 10 metres distance from the standing position. Scores for each shot were in increments of 1, with a maximum score of 10. The top 8 shooters in the qualifying round moved on to the final round. There, they fired an additional 10 shots. These shots scored in increments of .1, with a maximum score of 10.9. The total score from all 50 shots was used to determine final ranking.
