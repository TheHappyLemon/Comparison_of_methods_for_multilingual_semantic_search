Herbert Brotherson Jamison (September 17, 1875 â€“ June 22, 1938) was an American sprinter who won a silver medal in the 400 m at the 1896 Summer Olympics. His favorite event, 200 m, was not yet part of the Olympics. In 1897 Jamison graduated from Princeton University and joined the family business in agriculture. Seven years later he founded an insurance agency in his native Peoria, Illinois, which he ran until his death.
