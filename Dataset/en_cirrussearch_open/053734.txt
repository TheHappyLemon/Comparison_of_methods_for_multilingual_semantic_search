Among other contributions, he is known for the Levenshtein distance and a Levenshtein algorithm, which he developed in 1965. He graduated from the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Moscow State University in 1958 and worked at the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics in Moscow ever since. He was a fellow of the IEEE Information Theory Society. He received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal in 2006, for "contributions to the theory of error-correcting codes and information theory, including the Levenshtein distance".
