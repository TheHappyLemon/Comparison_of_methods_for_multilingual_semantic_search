The Church of Our Lady of the Chapel (French: Église Notre-Dame-de-la-Chapelle; Dutch: Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ter-Kapellekerk), or the Chapel Church (French: Église de la Chapelle; Dutch: Kapellekerk), is a Roman Catholic church located in the Marolles/Marollen district, in the historic centre of Brussels, Belgium. It is dedicated to Our Lady of the Chapel. The church, in a Romanesque-Gothic transitional style, was built between the 12th and 13th centuries above an earlier chapel. Following a fire in 1405, its nave was rebuilt in the Brabantine Gothic style and enlarged with side chapels. Its Baroque slate bell tower dates from the 18th century. The complex was designated a historic monument in 1936. The church is located on the Place de la Chapelle/Kapelleplein, between the Rue Haute/Hoogstraat and the Rue de la Chapelle/Kapellestraat. This site is served by Brussels-Chapel railway station.
