The 2017 Strade Bianche was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 4 March. It was the eleventh edition of the Strade Bianche and was the fifth event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. It was the first time that the race was included in the UCI World Tour calendar. Poland's Michał Kwiatkowski (Team Sky) became the second rider, after Fabian Cancellara, to win multiple editions of the race, after attacking from a group of four race favourites with around 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) remaining and was able to solo away to the race victory. Second place was taken by Greg Van Avermaet for the BMC Racing Team fifteen seconds in arrears, while a further two seconds back in third place, Lotto–Soudal's Tim Wellens completed the podium.
