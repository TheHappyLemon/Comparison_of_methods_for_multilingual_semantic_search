Latvia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 with the song "Angel in Disguise" written by Marats Ogļezņevs. The song was performed by the duo Musiqq. The Latvian broadcaster Latvijas Televīzija (LTV) organised the national final Eirodziesma 2011 in order to select the Latvian entry for the 2011 contest in Düsseldorf, Germany. Twenty songs were selected to compete in the national final, which consisted of four shows: two heats, one Second Chance round and a final. In the heats, five entries were selected to advance from each show: three entries selected based on a public televote and two entries selected by a seven-member jury panel. In the Second Chance round, two entries were selected to advance: one selected based on a public vote and one selected by the jury. Twelve songs ultimately qualified to compete in the final on 26 February 2011 where two rounds of voting by the public and jury selected "Angel in Disguise" performed by Musiqq as the winner. Latvia was drawn to compete in the second semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 12 May 2011. Performing during for the show in position 17, "Angel in Disguise" was not announced among the top 10 entries of the second semi-final and therefore did not qualify to compete in the final. It was later revealed that Latvia placed seventeenth out of the 19 participating countries in the semi-final with 25 points.
