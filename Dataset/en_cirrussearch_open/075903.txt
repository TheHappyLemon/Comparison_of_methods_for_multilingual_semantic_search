A blizzard is a severe snowstorm characterized by strong sustained winds and low visibility, lasting for a prolonged period of timeâ€”typically at least three or four hours. A ground blizzard is a weather condition where snow is not falling but loose snow on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. Blizzards can have an immense size and usually stretch to hundreds or thousands of kilometres.
