.ma is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Morocco (French: Maroc). A local registrar with a local Moroccan company as administrative contact is needed to register a .ma or .co.ma domain name. Further restrictions are imposed on the registering of other second-level domains (such as .net.ma or .gov.ma).
