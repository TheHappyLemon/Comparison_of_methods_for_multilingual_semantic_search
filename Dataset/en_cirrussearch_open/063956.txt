Castlebar (Irish: Caisle√°n an Bharraigh, meaning "Barry's Castle") is the county town of County Mayo, Ireland. Developing around a 13th-century castle of the de Barry family, from which the town got its name, the town now acts as a social and economic focal point for the surrounding hinterland. With a population of 13,054 in the 2022 census (up from 7,648 in the 1991 census), Castlebar was one of the fastest growing towns in Ireland in the early 21st century. A campus of Atlantic Technological University and the Country Life section of the National Museum are two important facilities in the area. The town is linked by railway to Dublin, Westport and Ballina. The main route by road is the N5.
