The 2005 Men's Ice Hockey Championships were held March 7 – May 15, 2005, in 7 cities in 6 countries: Vienna and Innsbruck, Austria (Championship); Debrecen, Hungary (Division I - Group A); Eindhoven, the Netherlands (Division I - Group B); Zagreb, Croatia (Division II - Group A); Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro (Division II - Group B); Mexico City, Mexico (Division III). The competition also served as qualification for division placements in the 2006 competition. It was a major professional tournament, because of the 2004–05 NHL labor dispute. This international event was the 69th such event sanctioned by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). The championship was won by the Czech Republic.
