The Svea Research Station is a Swedish research facility in Antarctica, established in 1987/1988. Svea is located in the Scharffenbergbotnen valley in the Heimefrontfjella mountain range, about 400Â km from the coast. It is a satellite station to the Wasa Research Station, and is used by small, transient research teams performing fieldwork in the area. The station is currently the home base for two permanent monitoring projects: continual geodetic measurement using GPS technology, run by the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and a seismograph that records movements in the Earth's crust, run by the German Alfred Wegener Institute.
