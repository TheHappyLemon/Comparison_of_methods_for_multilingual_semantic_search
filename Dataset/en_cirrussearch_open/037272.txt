The 2017 Dubai Tour was a road cycling stage race that took place in Dubai between 31 January and 4 February 2017. It was the fourth edition of the Dubai Tour and was rated as a 2.HC event as part of the 2017 UCI Asia Tour. The race was won for the second consecutive year by Germany's Marcel Kittel for the Quick-Step Floors team. Kittel won three of the four stages to be run – comfortably winning the points classification as a result – while in the other stage, Kittel was involved in a skirmish with Andriy Hrivko, which resulted in the Astana rider being ejected from the race. Kittel won the overall classification by 18 seconds ahead of LottoNL–Jumbo's Dylan Groenewegen from the Netherlands, who won the young rider classification in doing so. The final podium was completed by Kittel's compatriot John Degenkolb, a further two seconds in arrears, with the Trek–Segafredo rider winning the stage not won by Kittel. In the other race classifications, Italian rider Nicola Boem (Bardiani–CSF) won the intermediate sprints classification, while the UAE Abu Dhabi squad won the teams classification.
