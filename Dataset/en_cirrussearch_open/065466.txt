South Papua, officially the South Papua Province (Indonesian: Provinsi Papua Selatan), is an Indonesian province located in the southern portion of Papua, following the borders of the Papuan customary region of Anim Ha. Formally established on 11 November 2022 and including the four most southern regencies that were previously part of the province of Papua and before 11 December 2002 had comprised a larger Merauke Regency, it covers a land area of 117,849.16 km2, about the same area as Pennsylvania (or 90% of that of England). This area had a population of 513,617 at the 2020 Census, while the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 534,416 (comprising 277,844 males and 256,5762 females), making it the least populous province in Indonesia. It shares land borders with the sovereign state of Papua New Guinea to the east, as well as the Indonesian provinces of Highland Papua and Central Papua to the north and northwest, respectively. South Papua also faces the Arafura Sea in the west and south, which is a maritime border with Australia. The province comprises the Papuan customary region of Anim Ha. Merauke is the economic centre of South Papua, while its administrative centre is the town of Salor located in Kurik District of Merauke Regency, around 60 km northwest of Merauke.
