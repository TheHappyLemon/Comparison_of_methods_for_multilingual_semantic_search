Quetiapine, sold under the brand name Seroquel among others, is an atypical antipsychotic medication used for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Despite being widely used as a sleep aid due to its sedating effect, the benefits of such use may not outweigh its undesirable side effects. It is taken orally. Common side effects include sleepiness, constipation, weight gain, and dry mouth. Other side effects include low blood pressure with standing, seizures, a prolonged erection, high blood sugar, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In older people with dementia, its use increases the risk of death. Use in the third trimester of pregnancy may result in a movement disorder in the baby for some time after birth. Quetiapine is believed to work by blocking a number of receptors, including those for serotonin and dopamine. Quetiapine was developed in 1985 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 62nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10Â million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
