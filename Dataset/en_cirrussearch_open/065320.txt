Kuldīga (pronunciation) (German: Goldingen) is a town in the Courland region of Latvia, in the western part of the country. It is the center of Kuldīga Municipality with a population of approximately 13,500. Kuldīga was first mentioned in 1242. It joined the Hanseatic League in 1368. In the 17th century, Kuldīga (along with Jelgava) was one of the capitals of the Duchy of Courland from 1596 to 1616. Kuldīga is an ancient town in Latvia's western region of Kurzeme with distinctive architecture, which is included in the list of the UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. Saint Catherine is believed to be the patron saint of Kuldīga, and the oldest church of the town is named after St Catherine. The foundation of the building was laid as early as in 1252. The church has been remodeled a number of times. The small River Alekšupīte runs through the very centre of the Kuldīga old town, along the walls of the houses. The Old Town around the small river itself is the only[dubious – discuss] remaining 17th–18th-century ensemble of this kind in the Baltic states.[citation needed] A 4.2 metres high waterfall on the Alekšupīte is the highest in Latvia. The Venta Rapid, a 240-meter wide natural rapid on the Venta River, is the widest in Europe. Not far from the rapid is the Kuldīga brick bridge built in 1874, which is the longest bridge of this type in Europe. Kuldīga was recognized as an EDEN destination in 2007.
