Wilhelm Gustloff (30 January 1895 â€“ 4 February 1936) was the founder of the Swiss NSDAP/AO (the Nazi Party organisation for German citizens living outside Germany) at Davos. He led it from 1932 until his death. In 1936, Gustloff was assassinated by David Frankfurter, a Croatian Jew outraged by the growth of the Nazi Party. After killing Gustloff, Frankfurter immediately surrendered and confessed, telling the police that "I fired the shots because I am a Jew."
