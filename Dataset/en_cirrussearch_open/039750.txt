Amanita regalis, commonly known as the royal fly agaric or the king of Sweden Amanita, is a species of fungus in the family Amanitaceae. A. regalis has a scabby liver-brown cap and a stem which is yellow-ochre at the base, with patches or rings of patches. The fruit bodies somewhat resemble the smaller A. muscaria (fly agaric), which it was formerly regarded as a variety of. A. regalis is common in Scandinavia and also found in eastern and northern Europe. Its North American distribution is restricted to Alaska. Like A. muscaria, it is poisonous and contains the psychoactive compound muscimol.
