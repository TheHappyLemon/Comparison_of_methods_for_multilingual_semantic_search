The third Iranian satellite, and the second to be launched successfully using an indigenous rocket, Rasad-1 was Iran's first imaging satellite. Launched aboard a Safir-B carrier rocket, it was successfully placed into a low Earth orbit at an altitude of 236 by 299 kilometres (147 by 186 mi), inclined at 55.7 degrees. It made approximately fifteen orbits per day.[citation needed] Rasad-1 was launched on the maiden flight of the Safir-B rocket, designated Safir-B1, from a launch site in Semnan Province, Iran. The launch occurred at approximately 09:14 UTC on 15 June 2011 with the spacecraft reaching orbit several minutes later. The satellite had a mass of 15.3 kilograms (34 lb) and returned images with a resolution of 150 metres (490 ft).[citation needed] It was equipped with solar panels to generate power. The satellite decayed from orbit three weeks after launch, on 6 July 2011. Rasad 1 Telemetry AFSK Telemetry recorded from the Rasad 1 satellite on 465Mhz. Problems playing this file? See media help.
