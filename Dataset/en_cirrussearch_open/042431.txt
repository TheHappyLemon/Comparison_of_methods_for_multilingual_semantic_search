The Four Continents Figure Skating Championships (4CC) is an annual figure skating competition. The International Skating Union established it in 1999 to provide skaters representing non-European countries with a similar competition to the much older European Figure Skating Championships. The event's name refers to the Americas (North America and South America), Africa, Asia and Oceania (four of the five continents represented in the Olympic rings, omitting Europe). Medals are awarded in the disciplines of men's singles, women's singles, pairs, and ice dance. Historically, the 4CC has been dominated by just four countries – the United States, Japan, Canada, and China – which have won a combined 287 out of 300 possible medals. South Korea (9), Kazakhstan (2), North Korea (1), and Uzbekistan (1) are the only other countries to have earned Four Continents medals.
