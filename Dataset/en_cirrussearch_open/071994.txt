Disturbed is an American heavy metal band from Chicago, formed in 1994. The band includes guitarist Dan Donegan, drummer Mike Wengren, lead vocalist David Draiman and bassist John Moyer. Donegan and Wengren have been involved in the band since its inception, with Draiman replacing original lead vocalist Erich Awalt in 1996 and Moyer replacing original bassist Steve "Fuzz" Kmak in 2004. Disturbed's debut album, The Sickness, was released in 2000 as a commercial success, mainly due to the singles "Down With the Sickness" and "Stupify". The band then released the albums Believe (2002), Ten Thousand Fists (2005), Indestructible (2008), and Asylum (2010), all of which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011, during which the band's members focused on various side projects, and released The Lost Children, a compilation album containing previously unreleased songs. They returned in June 2015 and released their sixth album Immortalized that same year. They followed it up with the albums Evolution (2018) and Divisive (2022). With over 17 million records sold worldwide, six RIAA certifications for their albums (including 5Ã— platinum for The Sickness), singles from all eight albums reaching the top ten of the Mainstream Rock chart, and two Grammy Award nominations, Disturbed ranks alongside Slipknot and Godsmack as one of the most successful rock bands of the 21st century.
