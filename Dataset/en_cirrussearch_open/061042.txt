It has a wide-ranging natural habitat, is in found in forests, bogs, fens, and rock outcrops. Carex brunnescens is morphologically variable across its wide range. It has a different morphology when growing in shade vs. sunlight. Shade growing specimens tends to be slender and weak-stemmed with green scales, and sun growing specimens tend to be stiffly erect with brown scales.
