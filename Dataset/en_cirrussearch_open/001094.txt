The Whistler Olympic Park is the location of the Nordic events facilities for the 2010 Winter Olympics and is located in the Madeley Creek basin in the Callaghan Valley, west of Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. The facility hosted the biathlon, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping. After the Olympics the park remains a public facility, complementing the extensive wilderness trails and alpine routes already in use. Three temporary stadiums were built with a capacity for 12,000 spectators each (6,000 for the Paralympics). The location is approximately 8 km from the junction of its access road with Highway 99 and 14 km from the Whistler Olympic Village. The two year construction project saw, 14 km (8.7 mi) of cross country and biathlon trails, two ski jumps (HS 106 and HS 140 metre), and another 20 to 25 km of recreational trails built. There is also a permanent Biathlon range which can be used daily. Overall, $119.7 million was spent on the facilities in the Callaghan Valley. Permanent features were completed in the fall of 2007. It is now a public cross-country and back country ski facility. Located between the ski jumps and cross country area there is an 11,000-square-foot (1,000 m2) Day Lodge. Which has a gift shop, cafeteria, washrooms, lounge and rental center. In addition to the Lodge, there are two 6,000-square-foot (560 m2) Technical Buildings, one for Cross Country and one for Biathlon located at each of the sports main venue area of the park.
