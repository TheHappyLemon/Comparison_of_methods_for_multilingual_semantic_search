The Kazakh Uplands (Kazakh: Сарыарқа, Saryarqa - "Yellow Ridge", Russian: Казахский мелкосопочник, Kazakhskiy Melkosopochnik), also known as the Kazakh Hummocks, is a large peneplain formation extending throughout the central and eastern regions of Kazakhstan. Administratively the Kazakh Uplands stretch across the East Kazakhstan, Pavlodar, Akmola, Ulytau and Karaganda regions. Several notable cities, including the country's capital, Astana, are located in the uplands. There are large deposits of coal in the north and copper in the south.
