Crossroads is a 2002 American teen road comedy-drama film directed by Tamra Davis, from a screenplay by Shonda Rhimes. The film stars Britney Spears, Anson Mount, Zoe Saldana, Taryn Manning, Kim Cattrall, and Dan Aykroyd. Set in Georgia, its plot centers on three teenage girls on a cross-country road trip, as they find themselves and their friendship in the process. Development began in late 2000 when Spears created a concept that was later expanded by Rhimes. Principal filming began in March 2001, and encompassed over six months. Crossroads was produced by MTV Films and released on February 15, 2002, in North America by Paramount Pictures, and was a box office success, grossing $61.1 million worldwide on a $10â€’12 million budget. The film was panned by critics, though Spears' performance was praised. As part of a promotional campaign for Spears' memoir, the movie was acquired by Sony Music Entertainment who rereleased it to theaters on October 23 and 25, 2023, alongside a special edition of the soundtrack, which included three new remixes of Spears' songs.
