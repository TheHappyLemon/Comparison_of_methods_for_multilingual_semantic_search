The Resurrection of Christ Cathedral (Estonian: Narva Issanda Ülestõusmise peakirik, Russian: Нарвский Воскресенский собор) is a Neo-Byzantine style Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate located in Narva, Estonia. The church was constructed between 1890 and 1896 to cater to the religious needs of the cotton mill workers of the Krenholm Manufacturing Company. The cathedral was the only building standing after the bombing of the city in 1944 during World War II.
