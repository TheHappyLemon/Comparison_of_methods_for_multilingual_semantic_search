Pēteris Barisons (Sēlpils, 18 April 1904 — 13 July 1947) was a Latvian late romantic composer noted specially for his vocal output, which remain his most performed works. A disciple of Ernests Vīgners and Jānis Mediņš, in 1945 he was appointed a professor at the Latvian Conservatory, but he died just two years later, leaving a third symphony uncompleted. He was also active in conducting, which he studied under Jāzeps Vītols, briefly taking charge of the Latvian National Symphony for the 1936–37 season, and he premiered his Symphony No. 1 himself.
