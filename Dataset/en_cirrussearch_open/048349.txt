Sailing has been included as an event at every Summer Olympics since 1896 except the 1904 Summer Olympics. At the 1980 Summer Olympics sailing events were organised into six classes. In each class seven races in a particular sailing discipline were contested between the 19 and 29 July 1980. The Olympic city in 1980 was Moscow, but all sailing events took place in the Baltic Sea off the coast of Pirita, in Tallinn in present-day Estonia. At the time Tallinn was part of the Soviet Union. Events at this olympiad used triangular-type Olympic courses.
