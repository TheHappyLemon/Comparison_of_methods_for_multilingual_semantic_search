Olof Skötkonung, (Old Norse: Óláfr skautkonungr; c. 980–1022) sometimes stylized as Olaf the Swede, was King of Sweden, son of Eric the Victorious and, according to Icelandic sources, Sigrid the Haughty. He succeeded his father in c. 995. He stands at the threshold of recorded history, since he is the first Swedish ruler about whom there is substantial knowledge. He is regarded as the first king known to have ruled both the Swedes and the Geats. In Sweden, the reign of king Olov Skötkonung (c. 995–1022) is considered to be the transition from the Viking age to the Middle Ages, he was the first Christian king of the Swedes, who ruled central Sweden. Norse beliefs persisted in parts of Sweden until the 12–13th century (with some keeping the tradition into modern times). Olof was victorious alongside Sweyn Forkbeard when the kings created an alliance to defeat the Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvason in the Battle of Svolder. After the battle, the victorious leaders split Norway into areas of control. Heimskringla gives the most detailed account of the division. Olof received four districts in Trondheim as well as Møre, Romsdal and Rånrike.
