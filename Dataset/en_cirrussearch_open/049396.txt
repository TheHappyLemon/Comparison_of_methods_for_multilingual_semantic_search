The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) is the body in which the regulators of the telecommunications markets in the European Union work together. Other participants are the representatives of the European Commission, as well as telecommunication regulators from the member states of the EEA and of states that are in the process of joining the EU. BEREC commenced its activities in January 2010. Its mission is to contribute to the development of the European internal market for electronic communications networks and services to ensure that it functions well for the benefit of consumers and businesses alike. To achieve this, BEREC has two principal roles, the first is to ensure that the European Union (EU) regulatory framework is applied consistently across the Union and the second is to promote an effective internal market for the telecom sector. Additionally, as an expert body, BEREC assists the European Commission (EC) and the national regulatory authorities (NRAs) in implementing the EU regulatory framework and it provides advice to the European (legislative) institutions as well as support, at European level, for regulatory tasks performed by the NRAs at national level. BEREC was set up under Regulation (EC) No 1211/2009, which was part of the Telecoms Reform package (see: History). This regulation has since been replaced by Regulation (EU) 2018/1971 of the European Parliament (EP) and of the Council, known as the ‘BEREC Regulation’, which sets out the current legal basis for BEREC. BEREC has a Board of Regulators in which the national telecommunication regulators participate. Its activities are supported by the BEREC Office, which provides a range of tasks, including administrative support. BEREC Office is based in Riga, Latvia.
