Prisonball (also known as prison dodgeball, nationball, battleball, trench, jail ball, jail dodgeball, jailbreak, greek dodgeball, German dodgeball, teamball, crossfire, warball, Swedish dodgeball, dungeon dodge; king's court in Canada, heaven in New Zealand, and nuke'em) is played much like the original dodgeball game, except when a player is hit, they get put in "prison" behind the opposing team. To get out of prison, the player needs to receive a pass from a teammate while in the designated prison area. The way in which prisoners are released varies by region. "Prisoners" remain behind the opposing team until the game is over or they're released according to the current ruleset.
