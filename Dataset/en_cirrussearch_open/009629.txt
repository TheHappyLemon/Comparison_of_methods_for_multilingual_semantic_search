Insomniatic is the third studio album by American pop rock duo Aly & AJ, released on July 10, 2007 by Hollywood Records. The album features an electronic based sound, differing from their previous pop-rock and acoustic releases, that was accented with the use of synthesizers, sampling, drum programming and vocal processing effects. The lyrical content of the album is centered heavily around heartbreak, which some critics noted for its contrast to the electronic elements presented. Insomniatic was well received by many music critics, many of which lauded the duo for the lyrical depth and evolution. Others, however, found the composition of the album to be bland and unoriginal. The album debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200 with sales of 39,000. Two singles were spawned from the album. The first single, "Potential Breakup Song", was released on June 26, 2007 and charted within the top 30 in several countries, including the United States where it peaked at number 17. The song was also featured on an episode of MTV's The Hills. "Like Whoa" was released as the album's second single in early 2008 and charted in the lower regions of the charts. The album was the duo's final release with Hollywood Records. They left Hollywood in 2010 before forming their own label 78violet Music LLC.
