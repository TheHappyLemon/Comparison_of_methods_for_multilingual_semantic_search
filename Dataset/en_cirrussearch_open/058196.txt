The 1969â€“70 European Cup was the 15th season of the European Cup, a club football tournament organised by UEFA for the domestic league champions of its member associations. It was won by Feyenoord of the Netherlands, who beat Scottish club Celtic after extra time in the final at San Siro in Milan on 6 May 1970. It was the first time the title had been won by a club from the Netherlands, and sparked a period of Dutch dominance in the competition, as Ajax won the next three titles. For the first time in the European Cup, tiebreaker playoffs were abandoned in favour of the away goals rule; if both teams had scored the same number of away goals, one side was eliminated by the toss of a coin, something that was required in two of the matches (marked on the table below by "c/t"). Milan were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Eventual Champions Feyenoord in the second round.
