Charles Frédéric Petit (6 May 1857 – 19 February 1947) was a French competitor in the sport of archery. Petit competed in two events and won third prize in each. He is now considered by the International Olympic Committee to have won two bronze medals[1]. Both of Petit's events were the shorter 33 metre competitions, in both the Au Chapelet and Au Cordon Doré style.
