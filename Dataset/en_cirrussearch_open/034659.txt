"Un banc, un arbre, une rue" (French pronunciation: [œ̃ bɑ̃ œ̃n‿aʁbʁ yn ʁy]; "A Bench, a Tree, a Street") was the winning song of the Eurovision Song Contest 1971 performed in French by French singer Séverine, representing Monaco. The song is a classic French ballad, with the lyric focusing on the loss of childhood innocence, and people following their dreams. The opening lines to the chorus translate as "we all have a bench, a tree, a street / Where we cherished our dreams / a childhood that has been too short". This song is used as the theme song of Miss Hong Kong Pageant.
