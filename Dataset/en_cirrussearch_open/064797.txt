Nutty Professor II: The Klumps is a 2000 American comedy film directed by Peter Segal. It is the sequel to the 1996 film The Nutty Professor and the final installment in the remake series. In contrast to the previous film, subplots which are centered on the parents of protagonist Sherman Klump occupy a substantial part of the film. Members of the Klump family, including Sherman's parents, also provide an increased level of comic relief.
