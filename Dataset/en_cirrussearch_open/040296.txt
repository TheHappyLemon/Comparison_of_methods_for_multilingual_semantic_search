The Third Cabinet of Lars Løkke Rasmussen (colloquially, VLAK-regeringen or trekløverregeringen) took office on 28 November 2016, succeeding the Second Cabinet of Lars Løkke Rasmussen. It was a minority coalition government consisting of Venstre, the Liberal Alliance and the Conservative People's Party. It relied on parliamentary support from the Danish People's Party. Following the 2019 general election, Rasmussen tabled his resignation and the government continued as a caretaker government until 27 June when the Frederiksen Cabinet was appointed.
