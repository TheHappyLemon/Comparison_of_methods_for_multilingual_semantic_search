The river Neris (pronunciation) or Vilija (Belarusian: Ві́лія, romanized: Vilija, Polish: Wilia) rises in northern Belarus. It flows westward, passing through Vilnius (Lithuania's capital) and in the south-centre of that country it flows into the Nemunas (Neman) from the right bank, at Kaunas, as its main tributary. Its length is 510 km (320 mi). After passing through Belarus for 276 km (171 mi), the Neris flows through Lithuania for a further 235 km (146 mi). The Neris connects successive Lithuanian capitals – Kernavė and Vilnius. Along its banks are the burial places of the pagan Lithuanians. At 25 km (16 mi) from Vilnius there is are old Karmazinai Hillfort and Karmazinai burial mound [lt].
