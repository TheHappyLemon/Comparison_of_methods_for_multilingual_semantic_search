FK Teplice is a Czech professional football club based in the city of Teplice. The club competes in Czech First League, the top tier of Czech football. The club was founded after World War II in 1945. The club advanced to the Czechoslovak First League in just three years after being founded and played mostly in the First and Second Czechoslovak divisions. After the Velvet Revolution and comeback of rich sponsor, Glaverbel (spun out of glassworks Sklo Union in 1991), the club played in the Second Division until returning to the top flight in the 1996–97 Czech First League. Teplice were runners up in the 1998–99 Czech First League and went on to play in the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League, although they lost their first match against Borussia Dortmund. The club subsequently won the Czech Cup in 2003 and went on to beat Kaiserslautern and Feyenoord en route to the third round of the 2003–04 UEFA Cup before losing over two legs against Celtic.
