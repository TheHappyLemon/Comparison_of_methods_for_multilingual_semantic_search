Ze (З з; italics: З з) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the voiced alveolar fricative /z/, like the pronunciation of ⟨z⟩ in "zebra". Ze is romanized using the Latin letter ⟨z⟩. The shape of Ze is very similar to the Arabic numeral three ⟨3⟩, and should not be confused with the Cyrillic letter E ⟨Э⟩.
