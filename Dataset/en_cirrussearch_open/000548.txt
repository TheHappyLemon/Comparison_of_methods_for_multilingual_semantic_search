Under the current Constitution of Cameroon, the Prime Minister of Cameroon is a relatively powerless position. While the Prime Minister is officially appointed to be the head of government, the President retains most of the executive power and can fire the Prime Minister at will. The current prime minister, Joseph Ngute, was appointed by president Paul Biya. He took the office on 4 January 2019.
