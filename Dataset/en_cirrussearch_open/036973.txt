Western European Summer Time (WEST, UTC+01:00) is a summer daylight saving time scheme, 1 hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time and Coordinated Universal Time. It is used in: the Canary Islands Portugal (including Madeira but not the Azores) the Faroe Islands The following countries also use the same time zone for their daylight saving time but use a different title: United Kingdom, which uses British Summer Time (BST) Ireland, which uses Irish Standard Time (IST) (Am Caighdeánach na hÉireann (ACÉ)). Also sometimes erroneously referred to as "Irish Summer Time" (Am Samhraidh na hÉireann). The scheme runs from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October each year. At both the start and end of the schemes, clock changes take place at 01:00 UTC+00:00. During the winter, Western European Time (WET, GMT+0 or UTC±00:00) is used. The start and end dates of the scheme are asymmetrical in terms of daylight hours: the vernal time of year with a similar amount of daylight to late October is mid-February, well before the start of summer time. The asymmetry reflects temperature more than the length of daylight. Ireland observes Irish Standard Time during the summer months and changes to UTC±00:00 in winter. As Ireland's winter time period begins on the last Sunday in October and finishes on the last Sunday in March, the result is the same as if it observed summer time.
