Hilda Vīka (5 November 1897 – 14 February 1963), also known as Hilda Vīka-Eglīte, was a Latvian artist and writer. She made stylised watercolour and oil paintings of everyday life and dreamy visions. She wrote poetry, short stories and novels, illustrating her own works. Beginning in the 1930s, she incorporated Latvian mythology in her works. During the Soviet era she adapted to socialist realism but was expelled from the artist union for most of the 1950s. She was married to the writer Viktors Eglītis.
