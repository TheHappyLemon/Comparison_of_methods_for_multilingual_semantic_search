The winner was Roksana WÄ™giel, who represented Poland with the song "Anyone I Want to Be". Poland won the Junior Eurovision Song Contest for the first time. Returning country France came second, their best result at the contest, while Australia placed third for the second year in a row. Kazakhstan was the fourth best performing debuting nation, after Croatia and Italy's victories in 2003 and 2014 respectively, and Armenia's second place in 2007, finishing sixth, whilst Wales came last.
