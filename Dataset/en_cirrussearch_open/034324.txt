Aqidah (Arabic: عَقِيدَة, romanized: ʿaqīdah, IPA: [ʕɑˈqiːdæ], pl. عَقَائِد, ʿaqāʾid, [ʕɑˈqɑːʔɪd]) is an Islamic term of Arabic origin that literally means "creed". It is also called Islamic creed or Islamic theology. Aqidah goes beyond concise statements of faith and may not be part of an ordinary Muslim's religious instruction. It has been distinguished from iman in "taking the aspects of Iman and extending it to a detail level" often using "human interpretation or sources". Also, in contrast with iman, the word aqidah is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran. Many schools of Islamic theology expressing different aqidah exist. However, this term has taken a significant technical usage in the Islamic theology, and is a branch of Islamic studies describing the beliefs of Islam.
