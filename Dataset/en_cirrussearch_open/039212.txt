Villány (German: Wieland; Croatian: Viljan, Biljan or Vilanje; Serbian: Виљан, romanized: Viljan) is a town in Baranya County, Hungary that is famous for its wine. Residents are Hungarians, with minority of Croats, Serbs and Germans of Hungary. Until the end of World War II, the inhabitants were Danube Swabians, also called locally as Stifolder, because their ancestors arrived around 1720 from Fulda (district). Most of the former German settlers were expelled to Allied-occupied Germany and Allied-occupied Austria in 1945–1948, pursuant to the Potsdam Agreement. Only a few Germans of Hungary live there, the majority today are descendant of Hungarians from the Czechoslovak–Hungarian population exchange. They received the houses of the former Danube Swabians inhabitants.
