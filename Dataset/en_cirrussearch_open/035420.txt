A Just Russia – For Truth (official abbreviation of the full name Socialist Political Party "A Just Russia—Patriots—For Truth" (SRZP;) Russian: Справедливая Россия – За правду; СРЗП, romanized: Spravedlivaya Rossiya – Za pravdu; SRZP), formerly A Just Russia (SR), also referred to as Fair Russia, is a social conservative and social-democratic political party in Russia. The party is considered to be part of the "systemic opposition", but is generally sympathetic to the agenda of incumbent president Vladimir Putin, including his foreign policy. The party was formed on 28 October 2006 as a merger of the left-wing factions of Rodina, the Russian Party of Life and the Russian Pensioners' Party. Later, six further minor parties joined. It then called for a "New Socialism of the 21st Century" which guarantees the rights and freedoms of the individual and ensures the proper functioning of a welfare state. In 2011, Nikolai Levichev was elected as party chairman, succeeding Sergey Mironov who led the party in 2006–2011. On 27 October 2013, Mironov was re-elected as party chairman, and again on 28 October 2018. On 28 January 2021, the party merged with the For Truth and Patriots of Russia parties.
