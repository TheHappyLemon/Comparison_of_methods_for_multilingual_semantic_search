"It Would Be So Nice" is a song by the English rock band Pink Floyd, written by the keyboard player/singer Richard Wright. It was the fourth single released by the group and the first to feature new guitarist David Gilmour, following the departure of founding member Syd Barrett. The song was left out of the 1971 collection Relics which collected other rare tracks from Pink Floyd singles. Its B-side, "Julia Dream", was written by the bass guitarist Roger Waters (who was gradually transitioning into his eventual role as the predominant songwriter and vocalist) and was also re-released on The Early Singles.
