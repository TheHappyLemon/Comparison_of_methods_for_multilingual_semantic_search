Neurergus is a genus of salamanders, more specifically newts, in the family Salamandridae. They are found in the Middle East (predominantly in Turkey and Iran), and are kept and bred in captivity for their bright colors. In nature, they inhabit streams and small rivers, and the surrounding forests or shrublands. All of the Neurergus are considered threatened species, primarily due to destruction of habitat and overcollection for the pet trade.
