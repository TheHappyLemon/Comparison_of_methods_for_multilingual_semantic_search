Agrippina, Countess von Zarnekau (née Agrippina Constantines asuli Japaridze; Georgian: აგრაფინა ჯაფარიძე, გრაფინია ფონ ზარნეკაუ) (October 25 [6 November o.s.] , 1855 - October 18, 1926) was a Georgian aristocrat, socialite and patron of numerous educational establishments in Russian Imperial Georgia. She was known for her scandalous divorce and her even more controversial role in the secret marriage of Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia, which caused a rupture in the Russian Imperial Family. Her name is associated with architectural gems that still stand in Tbilisi and western Georgia, some of which continue to be subject of rumors surrounding the countess' eventful life and her tragic, solitary demise.
