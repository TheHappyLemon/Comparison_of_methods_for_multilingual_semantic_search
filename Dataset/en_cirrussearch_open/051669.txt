The Yugoslav national ice hockey team was the national men's ice hockey in the former republic of Yugoslavia. They competed in five Olympic Games competitions. This article discusses the team that represented the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its predecessors, but not the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. For the FRY, please see the Serbia and Montenegro men's national ice hockey team. The team was largely composed of players from Slovenia: throughout its existence 91% of all players on the national team were Slovene, and the entire roster for the team at the 1984 Winter Olympics, held in Sarajevo were from Slovenia.
