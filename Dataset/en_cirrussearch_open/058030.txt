Krystsina Siarheyeuna Tsimanouskaya, also spelled Kryscina Cimanowska (born 19 November 1996 in Klimowicze) is a Polish-Belarusian sprinter. She has won numerous medals at various events, including a silver medal in the 100 metres at the 2017 European U23 Championships, a gold medal in the 200 metres at the 2019 Summer Universiade, and a silver medal in the team event at the 2019 European Games. Tsimanouskaya qualified to represent Belarus at the 2020 Summer Olympics in the women's 100 m and 200 m events. On 30 July 2021, during the Games, she accused officials from the Belarus Olympic Committee of forcing her to compete in the 4 × 400 metres relay and entering her name for the race without her consent. On 1 August 2021, she was taken to Tokyo's Haneda Airport against her will, where she refused to board a flight to Belarus. She was eventually given police protection and granted a humanitarian visa by Poland, where she was later given Polish citizenship. In August 2023, the World Athletics Nationality Review Panel waived the normal three-year waiting period for nationality changes, allowing her to compete for Poland.
