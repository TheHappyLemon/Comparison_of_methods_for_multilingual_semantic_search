The General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (Yiddish: ‏אַלגעמײנער ייִדישער אַרבעטער־בונד אין ליטע, פּױלן און רוסלאַנד, romanized: Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter-bund in Lite, Poyln un Rusland), generally called The Bund (Yiddish: דער בונד, romanized: Der Bund, cognate to German: Bund, lit. 'federation' or 'union') or the Jewish Labour Bund (Yiddish: דער יידישער ארבעטער־בונד, romanized: Der Yidisher Arbeter-Bund), was a secular Jewish socialist party initially formed in the Russian Empire and active between 1897 and 1920. In 1917 the Bund organizations in Poland seceded from the Russian Bund and created a new Polish General Jewish Labour Bund which continued to operate in Poland in the years between the two world wars. The majority faction of the Russian Bund was dissolved in 1921 and incorporated into the Communist Party. Other remnants of the Bund endured in various countries. A member of the Bund was called a Bundist.
