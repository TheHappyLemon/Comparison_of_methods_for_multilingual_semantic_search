Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Zimbabwe accepted the convention on 16 August 1982. There are five World Heritage Sites in Zimbabwe, with a further two on the tentative list. The first site in Zimbabwe to be inscribed to the list was the Mana Pools National Park, Sapi and Chewore Safari Areas, in 1984. The most recent site listed was the Matobo Hills, in 2003. Three sites in Zimbabwe are listed for their cultural and two for their natural properties. Mosi-oa-Tunya / Victoria Falls is a transnational site, being shared with Zambia. Zimbabwe has served on the World Heritage Committee twice.
