Estádio Olímpico Milton de Souza Corrêa (Portuguese pronunciation: [isˈtadʒu oˈlĩpiku ˈmiwtõ dʒi ˈsowzɐ koˈʁejjɐ]), commonly known as Zerão [zɛˈɾɐ̃w], is a multi-purpose stadium located in Macapá, Brazil. It is used mostly for football matches and hosts the home matches of Esporte Clube Macapá, Oratório Recreativo Clube, Trem Desportivo Clube, Santos Futebol Clube (AP) and São Paulo Futebol Clube (AP). The stadium has a maximum capacity of 13,680 people and was built in 1990. The name (and the fame) come from the common belief that the midfield line lies exactly on the Equator - zero latitude - thus causing each team to defend one hemisphere. It is actually approximately 50 meters north of the equator, with the equator itself lying at the far southern end of the field.
