With Marseille, he won his first senior trophy, the Coupe de la Ligue in the 2011–12 season. In 2016, he left Marseille for Lyon, but after a disappointing year he left to join Italian club Torino, initially on loan but later on a permanent basis. Though initially impressing, he fell out of favour, and left the club in 2021, before signing for English club Watford Internationally, Nkoulou played 75 times for Cameroon between 2008 and 2017, and decided to retire shortly after winning the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, scoring the equalising goal in the final.
