Stereotypes of Jews are generalized representations of Jews, often caricatured and of a prejudiced and antisemitic nature. Reproduced common objects, phrases and traditions are used to emphasize or ridicule Jewishness. This includes but is not limited to the complaining and guilt-inflicting Jewish mother, often along with a meek nice Jewish boy, and the spoiled and materialistic Jewish-American princess.
