Estonian haiku (Estonian: Eesti haiku) is a short poem in Estonian that has adopted the form and style of the original Japanese haiku. Estonian haiku was first introduced in 2009. The so-called "Estonian haiku" is shorter than the Japanese one; the syllable count in Japanese haiku is 5+7+5, while Estonian haiku also goes in three lines but only comprises 4+6+4 syllables. Estonian authors claim that this is a distinctively Estonian form.
