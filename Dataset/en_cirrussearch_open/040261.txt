Cavorite is a fictional material first depicted by H. G. Wells in The First Men in the Moon, a 1901 scientific romance. Developed by Cavor, a reclusive physicist, it has the ability to negate the force of gravity, enabling him and a businessman named Bedford to travel to the Moon using a spherical spacecraft propelled by Cavorite blinds. The material was later referenced in numerous works of science fiction media, and its theoretical implications have been discussed by critics.
