Cabalzarite is a rare arsenate mineral with the chemical formula Ca(Mg,Al,Fe3+ ) 2[AsO 4] 2•2(H 2O,OH). It is a member of the tsumcorite group. It crystallizes in the monoclinic system and typically occurs as clusters of crystals or granular aggregates. It was first described for samples from an abandoned manganese mine in Falotta, Graubünden, Switzerland and named for Swiss amateur mineralogist Walter Cabalzar.
