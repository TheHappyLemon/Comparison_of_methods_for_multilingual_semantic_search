Pausanias (/pɔːˈseɪniəs/ paw-SAY-nee-əs; Greek: Παυσανίας; c. 110 – c. 180) was a Greek traveler and geographer of the second century AD. He is famous for his Description of Greece (Ἑλλάδος Περιήγησις, Hēlládos Periḗgēsis), a lengthy work that describes ancient Greece from his firsthand observations. Description of Greece provides crucial information for making links between classical literature and modern archaeology.
