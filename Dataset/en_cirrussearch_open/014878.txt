Marta Menegatti (born 16 August 1990) is an Italian beach volleyball player who plays as a left-side defender with her partner Viktoria Orsi Toth. With former teammate Greta Cicolari, she achieved a career-high world ranking of No. 4 in August 2012. Her career highlights include two gold, seven silver and seven bronze medals on the FIVB World Tour. She is also the 2011 European champion and the 2013 Mediterranean Games champion, both achieved with Cicolari. Menegatti represented Italy at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics, finishing fifth (with Cicolari) and ninth (with Laura Giombini) respectively. Born into a sporting family, Menegatti started playing indoor volleyball at the age of nine. Her transition to beach volleyball began six or seven years later and she made her international debut in 2006. A decorated junior player, she medalled at four age-group World and European Championships with different partners. Menegatti debuted on the World Tour with Cicolari in 2009. The pair entered the top ten of the world rankings by their third year and medalled at seven World Tour events before an acrimonious split midway through 2013. Menegatti then teamed up with Orsi Toth and reached the podium five more times over the next three years, including her first World Tour title in 2015. Following Orsi Toth's suspension right before the 2016 Olympics, Menegatti struggled with different partners. Orsi Toth's return in the summer of 2018 brought about a return to form, with Menegatti climbing from a low of No. 81 back into the top 25 of the world rankings. Menegatti has been noted as a complete player who can impact games on defense. She is the 2011 FIVB Most Improved Player.
