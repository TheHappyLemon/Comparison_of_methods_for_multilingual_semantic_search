Johan Clarey (born 8 January 1981) is a French World Cup alpine ski racer. He specializes in the speed events of downhill and super-G. Born in Annecy, Haute-Savoie, Clarey made his World Cup debut in November 2003 and has ten World Cup podiums through December 2023. He set a World Cup speed record in 2013 at the classic downhill race in Wengen, Switzerland, with a maximum speed of 161.9 km/h (100.6 mph) at the Haneggschuss, the fastest section of the Lauberhorn slope. Clarey finished fifth and was injured the following week at Kitzbühel and missed the remainder of the 2013 season, including the world championships. In the winter of 2014–15, Clarey was in the top 10 three times in World Cup races and twice in the winter of 2015–16. He was again on the podium on January 2017 in Kitzbühel. At age forty in January 2021, Clarey finished second in the downhill at Kitzbühel to become the oldest ever to make a World Cup podium, his eighth. One year later he again finished second in a Kitzbühel downhill race, thus beating his own age record. At the 2022 Winter Olympics in China, 41-year-old Clarey was the silver medalist in the downhill, one-tenth of a second back.
