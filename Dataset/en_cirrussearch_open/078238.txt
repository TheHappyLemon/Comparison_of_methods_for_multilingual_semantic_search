Live aus Berlin (pronounced [ˈlaɪf ʔaʊs bɛʁˈliːn], "Live from Berlin") is a recording of a concert by the German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein, performed in 1998 and released a year later. The release contains live performances of nearly every song from the band's debut album, Herzeleid (9 out of 11 songs, with the notable exception of "Der Meister" and "Das Alte Leid"), and most of the songs from their second album, Sehnsucht (8 out of 11 songs, with the notable exception of "Alter Mann", "Eifersucht", and "Küss Mich (Fellfrosch)"). It also includes a full-band rendition of the Sehnsucht b-side "Wilder Wein". The album has been released in several formats: CD (15 tracks) 2 CD Limited Edition (18 tracks + multimedia content) Censored VHS/DVD (Without Bück dich) Uncensored VHS (With Bück dich) Uncensored DVD, released in 2020 The performance of "Bück dich" ("Bend down", "Bend over") is controversial. The mimed portrayal of anal sex using a water-squirting dildo led to the video being given an 18 certificate in Europe. The first DVD release of the concert does not include the performance, although it is included on the uncensored version of the VHS and CD releases and the 2020 reissue of the DVD.
