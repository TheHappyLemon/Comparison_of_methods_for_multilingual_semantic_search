The 2018 NHL Entry Draft was the 56th NHL Entry Draft. The draft was held on June 22–23, 2018, at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas. The 2018 NHL Entry Draft was the second of two professional sports drafts to be held in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex during the calendar year, as the Dallas Cowboys hosted the 2018 NFL Draft in April. The first three selections were Rasmus Dahlin going to the Buffalo Sabres, Andrei Svechnikov being selected by the Carolina Hurricanes, and Jesperi Kotkaniemi being picked by the Montreal Canadiens. The 2018 draft featured both the first player trained in the United Kingdom to be drafted in Liam Kirk and the first Jamaican-born player drafted in Jermaine Loewen.
