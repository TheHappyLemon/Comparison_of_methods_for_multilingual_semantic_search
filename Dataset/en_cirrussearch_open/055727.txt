The 27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, honoring the best achievements in film and television performances for the year 2020, were presented on April 4, 2021. The ceremony was broadcast on both TNT and TBS at 9:00 P.M. EST / 6:00 P.M. PST, airing for one hour rather than the usual two. The nominees were announced by Lily Collins and Daveed Diggs on February 4, 2021 via Instagram Live. Additionally, the shortened one-hour show was pre-recorded. The winners were informed of their wins a few days before the telecast and the acceptance speeches were also pre-taped. These changes were a COVID-era decision in order to protect the guild's nominees and presenters. Michael Keaton made history by becoming the first person in SAG history to win three awards for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, winning this year for The Trial of the Chicago 7. In 2015 and 2016, he was part of the winning ensembles for Birdman (2014) and Spotlight (2015), respectively. Chadwick Boseman tied Jamie Foxx and Maggie Smith in the record for most nominations in a single ceremony with four: Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role for Da 5 Bloods, and as part of the ensembles of both films for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. Boseman ultimately won for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, making history as the first actor to win the category posthumously; his widow, Taylor Simone Ledward, accepted the award. The ceremony also marked the first time that all four individual film acting categories were won by people of color.
