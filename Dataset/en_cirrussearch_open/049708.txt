Behind Enemy Lines is a 2001 American war film directed by John Moore in his directorial debut, and starring Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman. The film tells the story of Lieutenant Chris Burnett, an American naval flight officer who is shot down over Bosnia and uncovers genocide during the Bosnian War. Meanwhile, the rear admiral commanding the carrier strike group to which he is assigned is struggling to gain approval to launch a combat search and rescue mission to save Burnett. The plot is loosely based on the 1995 MrkonjiÄ‡ Grad incident that occurred during the war. Released on November 30, 2001, Behind Enemy Lines received generally negative reviews from critics. However, it was a considerable box office success, taking in nearly $92 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. The film started a franchise of direct-to-video spiritual successors: Behind Enemy Lines II: Axis of Evil Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines, co-produced by WWE Studios.
