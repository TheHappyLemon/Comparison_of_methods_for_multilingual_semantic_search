Wagtails are a group of passerine birds that form the genus Motacilla in the family Motacillidae. The common name and genus name are derived from their characteristic tail pumping behaviour. Together with the pipits and longclaws they form the family Motacillidae. The forest wagtail belongs to the monotypic genus Dendronanthus which is closely related to Motacilla and sometimes included therein. The willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys) of Australia is not a true wagtail; it is named as such for its similarity to the Japanese wagtail and belongs to the genus of birds known as fantails.
