Geopathology (also Geopathy) is a theory that links the Earth's inherent radiation with the health of humans, animals and plants. The term is derived from Greek γεω- (geō-), combining form of γῆ (gê, “earth”) and πάθος (páthos, “suffering”) - ie pathology, widely used to describe infirmities. The term is more widely used in the adjectival form ie 'geopathic' (sometimes 'geopathological') and often linked to 'stress', creating the terms 'geopathic stress' and 'geostress'. Gustav Freiherr von Pohl has been described as the modern 'father' of geopathic stress. von Pohl conducted a study in the Bavarian town of Vilsbiburg in 1929 which purported to link focus points of 'earth-radiation' ger. Erdstrahlen with incidence of cancer. Ley lines (a supposition introduced by Alfred Watkins in 1925) have also been suggested to create geopathic stress.
