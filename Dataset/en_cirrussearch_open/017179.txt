Ekspress-MD1 (Russian: Экспресс-МД1), was a Russian geostationary communications satellite operated by Russian Satellite Communications Company (RSCC) and designed and manufactured by Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center on the Yakhta satellite bus for RSCC's Ekspress series. It massed 1,140 kg (2,510 lb) at launch, had a power production capacity of 1300 watts with a C-band and L-band payload. It was successfully launched along Ekspress-AM4 aboard a Proton-M / Briz-M from Baikonur on 11 February 2009. It was commissioned in the 80° East orbital position. The satellite failed on 4 July 2013, well short of its design life, for which RSCC collected the insurance.
