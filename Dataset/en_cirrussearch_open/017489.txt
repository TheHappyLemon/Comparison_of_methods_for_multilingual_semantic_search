Sean Michael Leonard Anderson (born March 25, 1988), known professionally as Big Sean, is an American rapper from Detroit, Michigan. He met high-profile rapper Kanye West as a teenager, and signed with his record label GOOD Music, an imprint of Def Jam Recordings in 2007. He gained popularity following the release of his third mixtape, Finally Famous Vol. 3: Big (2010). His debut studio album, Finally Famous (2011) peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and spawned the Billboard Hot 100-top 40 singles "My Last" (featuring Chris Brown), "Marvin & Chardonnay" (featuring Kanye West and Roscoe Dash), and "Dance (Ass)" (remixed featuring Nicki Minaj). His second album, Hall of Fame (2013) was supported by the top 40 single "Beware" (featuring Lil Wayne and Jhené Aiko), and likewise peaked at number three on the Billboard 200. His third album, Dark Sky Paradise (2015) debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and was led by the single "I Don't Fuck with You" (featuring E-40), which received octuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); each of the album's singles—"Paradise", "Blessings" (featuring Drake and Kanye West), "One Man Can Change the World" (featuring John Legend and Kanye West), and "Play No Games" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign and Chris Brown)—also received platinum certification. His fourth and fifth albums, I Decided (2017) and Detroit 2 (2020) likewise peaked atop the chart; the former was supported by the single "Bounce Back", which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains his highest-charting song. In the year following the latter album's release, he dissociated with West and parted ways with GOOD Music.
