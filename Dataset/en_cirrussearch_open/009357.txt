Maļinova (historically and locally known as Maļinovka) is a mid-size village in Maļinova Parish, Augšdaugava Municipality in the Latgale region of Latvia. It is a parish centre. It is located 19 km northeast of Daugavpils at the A13 national road/European route E262. The inhabited locality grew up out of the former Malinovka village after World War II as a centre of a selsoviet and the Znamya Oktyabrya kolkhoz. Today Maļinova is the home of the parish administration, a house of culture, library, feldsher station and the Elijah the Prophet Orthodox church.
