Andrea Moda Formula was a Formula One team that competed during the 1992 Formula One World Championship. The team was owned by Italian shoe designer Andrea Sassetti, who named the team after his company. The team contested nine races but managed to only qualify for one. Statistically, and by general perception, Andrea Moda is widely considered to be one of the poorest constructors to ever enter Formula One.
