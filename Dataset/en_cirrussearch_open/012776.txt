The Principality of Tver (Russian: Тверское княжество, romanized: Tverskoye knyazhestvo; Latin: Tferiae) was a principality which existed between the 13th and the 15th centuries with its capital in Tver. It was one of the states established after the decay of the Kievan Rus'. During the 14th century, Tver rivaled the Principality of Moscow with the aim to become the center of the united Russian state. Eventually it lost, decayed, and in 1485, it was annexed by Moscow. The principality was located approximately in the area currently occupied by Tver Oblast and the eastern part of Smolensk Oblast in Russia.
