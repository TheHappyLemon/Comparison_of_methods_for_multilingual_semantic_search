The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Kiribati accepted the convention on May 12, 2000, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Kiribati has only one World Heritage Site, Phoenix Islands Protected Area, which was inscribed in 2010.
