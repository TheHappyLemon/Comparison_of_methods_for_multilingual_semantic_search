The Russian Route M7 (also known as the Volga Highway) is a major trunk road running from Moscow through Vladimir and Nizhny Novgorod to Kazan in Tatarstan and Ufa in Bashkortostan. It generally follows the route of the historic Vladimirka road and, to a large extent, forms part of the European route E22. The section from Yelabuga to Ufa is also part of European route E017. In 1 November 2023, Russian Federal Government announced to shorten the M7 highway to Kazan, by 31 December 2024, the cutted section will be altered to parts of M12 from Shali, Kazan to Diltuli; R240 from Diltuli to Ufa; and R243 for the branch section to either Izhevsk or Perm.
