Revolutionary Road is a 2008 romantic drama film directed by Sam Mendes and written by Justin Haythe, based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Frank and April Wheeler, with Michael Shannon, Kathryn Hahn, David Harbour, and Kathy Bates in supporting roles. Set in the mid-1950s, the Wheelers struggle to cope with their personal problems and the ensuing breakdown in their marriage. Revolutionary Road is the second onscreen collaboration for DiCaprio, Winslet, and Bates, all of whom previously co-starred in 1997's Titanic. The film soundtrack was composed by Thomas Newman, his fourth collaboration with Mendes. Development of the film adaptation began in 1961. However, a lack of commercial prospects and disagreements with the screenplay caused the project to be in limbo until the 2000s. BBC Films eventually purchased the film rights to the novel and Haythe rewrote the screenplay. Winslet read the script and persuaded her then-husband Mendes to direct, and DiCaprio to play the role of Frank. Revolutionary Road was theatrically released in the United States on December 26, 2008, by Paramount Pictures. The film grossed over $79.6 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, who mostly praised the performances of Winslet, DiCaprio, and Shannon, as well as its faithfulness to the novel. At the 81st Academy Awards, the film earned three nominations: Best Supporting Actor for Shannon, Best Art Direction, and Best Costume Design. It also received four nominations at the 62nd British Academy Film Awards and four nominations, including Best Motion Picture â€“ Drama, at the 66th Golden Globe Awards, with Winslet winning Best Actress.
