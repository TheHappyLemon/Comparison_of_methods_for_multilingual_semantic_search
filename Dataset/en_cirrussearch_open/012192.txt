First Baltic channel (Latvian: Pirmais Baltijas kanāls; abbreviated PBK; Russian: Первый Балтийский канал, romanized: Pervyy Baltiyskiy kanal) was a Baltic pay television channel based on the largest Russian Channel One to broadcast its programs in the Baltic states. It was launched on 4 September 2002. The channel had also broadcast the local news programme Latvian time (Russian: Латвийское время) since June 2003. The channel was closed in Latvia on 26 October 2021 due to misinformation about COVID-19 and two other violations. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, its license was revoked and the channel was effectively banned in all three Baltic States.
