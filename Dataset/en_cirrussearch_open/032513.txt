Xandros, Inc. was a software company which sold Xandros Desktop, a Linux distribution. The name Xandros was derived from the X Window System and the Greek island of Andros. Xandros was founded in May 2001 by Linux Global Partners (Will Roseman and Dr. Frederick Berenstein). The company was headquartered in New York City with its development office in Ottawa, Canada. Xandros Desktop was based on Corel Linux, a Debian-based distribution that was acquired along with the development team behind the product from Corel Corporation in August 2001 after Corel decided to exit the Linux distribution market. Xandros was a founding member of the Desktop Linux Consortium and member of the Interop Vendor Alliance. In July 2007, Xandros bought Scalix, a Linux-based email and collaboration product, based on HP OpenMail. In July 2008, Xandros acquired Linspire. In 2013, Xandros, Inc. changed its name to Bridgeways, Inc.[1], and soon after, the Xandros website was taken offline. (The Xandros website was last updated in November 2009.) As a result, DistroWatch listed Xandros as discontinued. On 1 January 2018, PC/OpenSystems LLC purchased Xandros and Linspire from Bridgeways, Inc., and resurrected the Xandros branding withXandros OpenDesktop[2] (a commercial release) and Xandros OpenServer[3] (a free release), based on Ubuntu 20.04. Xandros OpenDesktop would later be rebranded as Xandros Enterprise Desktop, and Xandros OpenServer would be rebranded as Xandros Enterprise Server, and PC/OpenSystems also introduced free versions named Xandros Community Edition (using GNOME) and Xandros Developer Edition (using dwm).
