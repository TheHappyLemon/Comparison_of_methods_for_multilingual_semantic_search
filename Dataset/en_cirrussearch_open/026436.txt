Sète (French pronunciation: [sɛt]; Occitan: Seta, [ˈsetɔ]), also historically spelled Cette (official until 1928) and Sette, is a commune in the Hérault department, in the region of Occitania, southern France. Its inhabitants are called Sétois (male) and Sétoises (female) in French, "Setòris" and "Setòria" in Occitan. Known as the Venice of Languedoc and the singular island (in Paul Valéry's words), it is a port and a seaside resort on the Mediterranean with its own very strong cultural identity, traditions, cuisine and dialect. It is the hometown of such artists as Paul Valéry, Jean Vilar, Georges Brassens, Hervé Di Rosa, Manitas de Plata, and Robert Combas. Since 2001, François Commeinhes is the mayor of the city.
