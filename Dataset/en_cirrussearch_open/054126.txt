Dainis Īvāns (born 25 September 1955 in Madona) is a Latvian journalist and politician. He has worked as a journalist since 1979 and gained public attention in 1986 by opposing construction of another hydro-electric dam on the Daugava river, near the city of Daugavpils. Īvāns highlighted the loss of landscapes and the relocation of numerous villages and towns required in the course of the dam's construction. As a result of the media campaign led by Īvāns, the construction of the dam was cancelled. He was awarded the title of Most Popular Journalist of 1986.
