The Giuoco Piano (Italian for 'Quiet Game'; pronounced [ˈdʒwɔːko ˈpjaːno]) is a chess opening beginning with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 "White aims to develop quickly – but so does Black. White can construct a pawn centre but in unfavourable conditions a centre which cannot provide a basis for further active play." The name "Italian Game" is also commonly used; however, that name is sometimes used instead to describe all openings starting 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4, including 3...Nf6 (the Two Knights Defence) and other less common replies. The Giuoco Piano is assigned codes C50 to C54 in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
