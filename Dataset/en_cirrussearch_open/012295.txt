The "National Anthem of Honduras" (Spanish: Himno Nacional de Honduras) was adopted by presidential decree 42 in 1915. The lyrics were written by Augusto Constantino Coello and the music composed by Carlos Hartling. Unofficially, the anthem is sometimes called "Tu bandera es un lampo de cielo" ("Your flag is a splendour of sky"), which is in the first line of the chorus.
