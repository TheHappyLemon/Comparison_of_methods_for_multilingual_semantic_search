Parallel bars are floor apparatus consisting of two wooden bars slightly over 3.4 metres (11Â ft) long and positioned at roughly head height. Parallel bars are used in artistic gymnastics and also for physical therapy and home exercise. Gymnasts may optionally wear grips when performing a routine on the parallel bars, although this is uncommon.
