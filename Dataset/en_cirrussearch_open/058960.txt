José María Bakero Escudero (born 11 February 1963) is a Spanish former professional footballer, and a manager. Having played mainly for Real Sociedad and Barcelona, he began his career as a forward (not being a prolific goalscorer) but was converted into an attacking midfielder, who possessed passing and scoring ability (with both his right foot and his head, the second despite his short stature) and great leadership skills. During a 17-year professional career, he amassed La Liga totals of 483 games and 139 goals, winning a total of 17 titles. A Spanish international for seven years, he represented the nation in two World Cups and one European Championship. Bakero began working as a manager in 1999.
