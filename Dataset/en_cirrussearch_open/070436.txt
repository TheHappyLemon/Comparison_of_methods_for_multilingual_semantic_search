The Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia (Egyptian Arabic: ويكيبيديا مصرى [wikiˈbedjæ ˈmɑsˤɾi, wikiˈpidjæ], ⟨wykybydya mṣry⟩) is the Egyptian Arabic version of Wikipedia, a free, open-content encyclopedia. This Wikipedia primarily acts as an alternative to the Arabic Wikipedia in favor of speakers of the Egyptian dialect. Until 2020, it was the only Wikipedia written in a localised dialect of Arabic. The second one is Moroccan Wikipedia, which was approved and created in July 2020. This edition of Wikipedia has 1,622,480 articles and 234,073 registered users, including 7 administrators. In December 2022, it was the third most visited language Wikipedia in Egypt with 2 million page views. It ranked below the Arabic Wikipedia (43 million) and the English Wikipedia (18 million).
