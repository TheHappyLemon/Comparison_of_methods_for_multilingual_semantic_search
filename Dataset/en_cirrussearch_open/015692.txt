Lake Mweru (also spelled Mwelu, Mwero) is a freshwater lake on the longest arm of Africa's second-longest river, the Congo. Located on the border between Zambia and Democratic Republic of the Congo, it makes up 110 kilometres (68Â mi) of the total length of the Congo, lying between its Luapula River (upstream) and Luvua River (downstream) segments. Mweru means 'lake' in a number of Bantu languages, so it is often referred to as just 'Mweru'.
