Alexandre Armand Lacazette (born 28 May 1991) is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Lyon. He plays mainly as a striker, but has also been deployed as a second striker and wide forward. Lacazette began his senior career with hometown club Lyon in 2010, at age 19. Initially a wide forward, he was converted into a striker, and finished as Ligue 1 top goalscorer and won Ligue 1 Player of the Year in the 2014–15 season. In 2017, Lacazette was the subject of a then-club record association football transfer when he signed for Arsenal in a transfer worth up to £47.5 million (€53 million), with whom he won the FA Cup in 2020 and reached the 2019 UEFA Europa League final. In 2022, Lacazette returned to Lyon on a free transfer, and became the club's second-highest all-time top goalscorer. Lacazette made his debut for the senior side of the France national team in 2013, after he represented his nation across all youth levels. Lacazette was a key contributor in France's victory in the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, where he scored the match-winning goal in the final against Spain. He recorded three goals in sixteen appearances.
