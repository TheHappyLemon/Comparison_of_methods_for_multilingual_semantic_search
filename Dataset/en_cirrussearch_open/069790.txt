Xiaomi M365 or Mi Electric Scooter is a consumer electric scooter by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi. Released in December 2016, it debuted three months before the dockless rental scooter operator Bird commenced service. The M365 is the model used for the original Bird rental scooters. In terms of private ownership, the model is readily available in Europe, where it is said to have "democratized" the motorized kick scooter, due to its competitive price (often €350-€400), and it being one of the easiest scooters to operate.
