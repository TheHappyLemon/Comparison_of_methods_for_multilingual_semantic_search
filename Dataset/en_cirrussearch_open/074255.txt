The Russkaya Pravda (Rus' Justice, Rus' Truth, or Russian Justice; Old East Slavic: Правда роусьскаꙗ, Pravda Rusĭskaya (13th century, 1280), Правда Руськая, Pravda Rus'kaya (second half of the 15th century); Russian: Русская правда, Russkaya Pravda; Ukrainian: Руська Правда, Rus'ka Pravda) was the legal code of Kievan Rus' and the subsequent Rus' principalities during the times of feudal division. It was written at the beginning of the 12th century and remade during many centuries. The basis of the Russkaya Pravda, Pravda of Yaroslav was written at the beginning of the 11th century. The Russkaya Pravda was a main source of Kievan Rus' law. In spite of great influence of Byzantine legislation on the contemporary world, and in spite of great cultural and commercial ties between Byzantium and Kievan Rus', the Russkaya Pravda bore no similarity whatsoever to that of the Byzantine Empire. The absence of capital and corporal punishment rather reflects Norse jurisprudence.
