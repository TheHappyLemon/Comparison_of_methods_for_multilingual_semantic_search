Liberibacter is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria in the Rhizobiaceae family. Detection of the liberibacteria is based on PCR amplification of their 16S rRNA gene with specific primers. Members of the genus are plant pathogens mostly transmitted by psyllids. The genus was originally spelled Liberobacter. Most importantly, Liberibacter is a causative agent of Huanglongbing disease (HLB) also known as citrus greening disease. Liberibacter is transmitted by two insects from Psyllidae family – Diaphorina citri in Asia, Brazil and Florida, and Trioza erytreae in Africa. The Asian HLB strain, "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus" is more heat tolerant, while the African strain, Candidatus Liberibacter africanus is asymptomatic at temperatures above 30 °C. Species of Liberibacter, infecting solanaceous plants has been identified and it was carried by another psyllid, a potato pest Bactericera cockerelli.
