Serdar Gurbangulyýewiç Berdimuhamedow (Turkmen pronunciation: [θɛɾˈdɑɾ ɢʊɾbɑnʁʊˈlɯjɛβɪtʃ bɛɾdɯmʊxɑmɛˈdoβ]; born 22 September 1981) is a Turkmen politician serving as the third and current president of Turkmenistan since 19 March 2022. Berdimuhamedow had previously served in several other positions within the government of his father, Gurbanguly, the long-standing authoritarian ruler of Turkmenistan. The father and son entered into a power-sharing arrangement in 2022 whereby they jointly rule an authoritarian system of government in Turkmenistan. In 2021, he became one of several deputy chairmen in the Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan. The next year, he won 73 percent of the vote in the country's presidential election, considered to be neither free nor fair, succeeding his father's 15-year-long totalitarian tenure as president and making Turkmenistan the first modern country in Central Asia to be ruled by a dynastic system.
