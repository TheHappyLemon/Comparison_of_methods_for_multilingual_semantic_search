Lake Trasimeno (/ˌtrɑːzɪˈmeɪnoʊ/ TRAH-zim-AY-noh, also US: /-ˈmiːnoʊ, ˌtræz-/ -⁠EE-, TRAZ-im-; Italian: Lago Trasimeno [ˈlaːɡo traziˈmɛːno]; Latin: Trasumennus; Etruscan: Tarśmina), also referred to as Trasimene (/ˈtræzɪmiːn/ TRAZ-im-een) or Thrasimene in English, is a lake in the province of Perugia, in the Umbria region of Italy on the border with Tuscany. The lake is south of the river Po and north of the nearby river Tiber and has a surface area of 128 km2 (49.4 sq mi), making it the fourth largest in Italy, slightly smaller than Lake Como. Only two minor streams flow directly into the Lake and none flows out. The water level of the lake fluctuates significantly according to rainfall levels and the seasonal demands from the towns, villages and farms near the shore.
