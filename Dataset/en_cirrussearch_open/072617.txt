Diane Lane (born January 22, 1965) is an American actress. The film that could have catapulted her to star status, Streets of Fire (1984), was both a commercial and critical failure, and her career languished as a result. After taking a break, Lane returned to acting to appear in The Big Town and Lady Beware (both 1987), but did not make another big impression on a sizable audience until the western miniseries Lonesome Dove (1989), for which she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. Lane earned further recognition for her role in A Walk on the Moon (1999), for which she was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead. This was followed by several film roles of varying degrees of success such as My Dog Skip, The Perfect Storm (both 2000), The Glass House, and Hardball (both 2001). Lane was especially lauded for her role in Unfaithful (2002), which earned her Satellite, New York Film Critics Circle, and National Society of Film Critics awards for Best Actress. Her performance in Unfaithful also garnered her Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Actress. She was also highly acclaimed by critics for her role in Under the Tuscan Sun (2003). For much of the rest of the decade, she alternately appeared in romances such as Must Love Dogs (2005) and Nights in Rodanthe (2008), and thrillers such as Fierce People (2005), Hollywoodland (2006), and Untraceable (2008). She has appeared in four films directed by Francis Ford Coppola: The Outsiders, Rumble Fish (both 1983), The Cotton Club (1984), and Jack (1996), and also appeared in one film directed by his wife Eleanor Coppola: Paris Can Wait (2016). Lane had a recurring role as Martha Kent, the adoptive mother of Superman in Man of Steel (2013), and subsequent films of the DC Extended Universe. Since then Diane Lane has remained in demand for highly prestigious movies and shows including lead roles in the thriller Let Him Go (a box office Number 1 in 2020) co-starring Kevin Costner, in the Ryan Murphy epic Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, the Scott Z. Burns anthology series Extrapolations for Apple TV+, the animated Pixar sequel Inside Out 2 (reprising her role as Rileyâ€™s Mom), the upcoming Netflix show A Man in Full, based on the Tom Wolfe novel of the same name, and most recently, the thriller movie Anniversary set to be released in 2024-25.
