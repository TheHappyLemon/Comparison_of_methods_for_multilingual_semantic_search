The 2018 IIHF World Championship Division I was an international ice hockey tournament run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The Group A tournament was held in Budapest, Hungary and the Group B tournament was held in Kaunas, Lithuania from 22 to 28 April 2018. Warsaw, Poland planned on bidding for the tournament, but as Poland had hosted both the 2015 and 2016 tournaments, decided to apply for a later year. Great Britain and Italy were promoted to the Top Division, while Poland was relegated to Division I B. The Group B tournament was won by Lithuania, who moved up to Group A and Croatia was relegated to Division II.
