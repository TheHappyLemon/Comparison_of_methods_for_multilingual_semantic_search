Glycine (soybean or soya bean) is a genus in the bean family Fabaceae. The best known species is the cultivated soybean (Glycine max). While the majority of the species are found only in Australia, the soybean's native range is in East Asia. A few species extend from Australia to East Asia (e.g., G. tomentella and G. tabacina). Glycine species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species: the engrailed, nutmeg and turnip moths have all been recorded on soybean.
