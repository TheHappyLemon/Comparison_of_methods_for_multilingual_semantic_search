The 1959–60 European Cup was the fifth season of the European Cup, Europe's premier club football tournament. The competition was won by Real Madrid, who beat Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 in the final at Hampden Park, Glasgow, on 18 May 1960. It remains the record score for the European Cup final. It was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive European Cup title, which is a feat that no other club has matched. It was also the first time that a German team, Eintracht Frankfurt, reached the final. They were debutants in the competition and it wasn't until 1983–84 European Cup and AS Roma that another debutants ended up on the losing side in the final. The tournament saw the first participation by a Greek club Olympiacos, who had withdrawn from the previous season after been already placed in the bracket. It meant that no new country entered the competition for the first time since tournament inception.
