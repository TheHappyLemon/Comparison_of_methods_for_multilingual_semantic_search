EURES (European employment services) is a European cooperation network between the European Commission, the European Labour Authority (ELA), the national public and other admitted employment services in all the EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. EURES facilitates the free movement of workers by providing information and employment support services to workers and employers, and by enhancing cooperation and information exchange between its member organisations. The European Labour Authority (ELA) coordinates the EURES network since 2021.
