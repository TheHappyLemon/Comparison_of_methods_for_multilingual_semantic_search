Xenodermidae is a family of snakes native to East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. All species in the family Xenodermidae are small or moderately sized snakes, never more than 80 cm (31 in) but typically less than 55 cm (22 in) in total length (including tail). They are secretive, probably nocturnal, and typically inhabit moist forest habitats. They seem to be opportunistic carnivores, preying on other vertebrates. The correct spelling of the family name is Xenodermidae, not "Xenodermatidae".
