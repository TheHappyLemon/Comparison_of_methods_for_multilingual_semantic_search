Pernis is a genus of birds in the raptor subfamily Perninae. Its members are commonly known as honey buzzards. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek pernes περνης, a term used by Aristotle for a bird of prey. They breed in temperate and warmer climates of the Old World, and are specialist feeders on wasp and bee larvae. The two temperate species, the European and crested honey buzzards, are migratory. They breed in woodland, and are often inconspicuous except when displaying. The members of this genus have plumage which mimics that of juvenile common buzzards or of Nisaetus hawk-eagles. It has been suggested that the similarity has arisen as a partial protection against predation by larger raptors such as goshawks, which may be wary about attacking what appears to be a better-protected species with stronger bill and talons than the honey buzzards actually possess.
