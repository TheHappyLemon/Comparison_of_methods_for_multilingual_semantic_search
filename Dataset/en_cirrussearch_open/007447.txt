The Albania national football team (Albanian: Kombëtarja e futbollit të Shqipërisë) represents Albania in men's international football, and is governed by the Albanian Football Association, the governing body for football in Albania. Albania competes in the three major international football tournaments—the FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Championship and UEFA Nations League. Albania was the winner of the 1946 Balkan Cup and the 2000 Malta Rothmans International Tournament. At Euro 2016, Albania made its debut at a major men's football tournament, scoring its first goal and recording its first victory in a major tournament against Romania on 19 June 2016. They will compete in Euro 2024. Since its completion in 2019, Arena Kombëtare (National Arena), known as Air Albania Stadium for sponsorship reasons, has been the team's home ground. Albania's highest FIFA World Ranking was 22nd in August 2015. The team uses red, white and black colours and the Albanian double headed eagle as its symbol. Its supporters are collectively known as the Tifozët Kuq e Zi and use the same national red and black colours. In 2020, Albania won group 4 of UEFA Nations League C and was promoted to UEFA Nations League B.
