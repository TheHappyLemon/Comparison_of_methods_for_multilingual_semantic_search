In machine learning, a neural network (also artificial neural network or neural net, abbreviated ANN or NN) is a model inspired by the neuronal organization found in the biological neural networks in animal brains. An ANN is made of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a brain. These are connected by edges, which model the synapses in a brain. An artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons. The "signal" is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs, called the activation function. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly passing through multiple intermediate layers (hidden layers). A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. Artificial neural networks are used for predictive modeling, adaptive control, and other applications where they can be trained via a dataset. They are also used to solve problems in artificial intelligence. Networks can learn from experience, and can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.
