CZ*ECO Nelson, also known as ECO Nelson to 2018 or Nelson Structures according to the ATS, is an Antarctic station on Nelson Island in the South Shetland Islands in Antarctica. The station was founded by the Czech explorer and writer Jaroslav Pavlíček in December 1988 and was the only private station in Antarctica for 30 years until its founder donated it to the Czech Antarctic Foundation (ČANF) in October 2017. The station is now operated by Masaryk University in Brno as part of the Czech Antarctic Research Programme. In 1988, the university leased the station for 99 years, with a plan to implement scientific activities. Staying at the station requires permission.
