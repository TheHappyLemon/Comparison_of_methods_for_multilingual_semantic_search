The Supercoppa Italiana (English: Italian Super Cup) is an annual super cup tournament in Italian football. Founded in 1988 as a two-team competition, it has featured four teams from the 2023 edition onwards: the winners and runners-up of the previous season's Serie A and Coppa Italia. Up until 2023, it was a match contested by the winners of the Serie A and the Coppa Italia in the previous season. If the same team won both the Serie A and Coppa Italia titles in the previous season, the Supercoppa was contested by the Serie A winner and the Coppa Italia runner-up, in essence becoming a rematch of the previous year's Coppa Italia final. Originally, it was scheduled in the summer as a curtain-raiser to the new season, played at the home stadium of the Serie A champions. Since 2018, the competition has been scheduled during the winter months and takes place mainly outside Italy. Juventus is the most successful club with nine titles. The most frequent Supercoppa match-up has been Juventus against Lazio, occurring on five occasions.
