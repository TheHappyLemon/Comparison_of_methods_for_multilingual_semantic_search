Slovaks in Hungary (Slovak: Maďarskí Slováci, Hungarian: magyarországi szlovákok or magyarországi tótok) are the fourth largest minority in Hungary, after Romas, Germans and Romanians. According to the Microcensus in 2016, 29,794 Slovaks live in the country. The number of people who can speak the Slovak language is 56,107, but this also includes ethnic Hungarians from Slovakia. According to the estimates of minority organisations, the number of people with Slovak ancestry might be as high as 100,000-110,000. Hence, the estimated population of Slovaks in Hungary ranges from 0.18% to 1.1% of the total population, depending on the criteria.
