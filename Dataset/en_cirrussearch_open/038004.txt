The Slovak koruna or Slovak crown (Slovak: slovenská koruna, literally meaning Slovak crown) was the currency of Slovakia between 8 February 1993 and 31 December 2008, and could be used for cash payment until 16 January 2009. The ISO 4217 code was SKK and the local abbreviation was Sk. The koruna was subdivided into 100 haliers (abbreviated as "hal." or simply "h", singular: halier). The abbreviation is placed after the numeric value. Slovakia switched its currency from the koruna to the euro on 1 January 2009, at a rate of 30.1260 korunas per euro. Both currencies could still be used for a two-week transitional period until 16 January 2009. In Slovak, the nouns koruna and halier both have two plural forms. "Koruny" and haliere appear after the numbers 2, 3 and 4 and in generic (uncountable) context, with korún and halierov being used after other numbers. The latter forms are genitive.
