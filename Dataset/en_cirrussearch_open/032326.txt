Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Sudan accepted the convention on 6 June 1974. There are three World Heritage Sites in Sudan, with a further 15 on the tentative list. The first site in Sudan was listed in 2003, this was Jebel Barkal and the associated sites. The sites of Meroë were listed in 2011 and Sanganeb Marine National Park and Dungonab Bay – Mukkawar Island Marine National Park in 2016. The latter is a natural site while the first two are listed for their cultural significance. Sudan has served one term on the World Heritage Committee.
