Fabio Pereira da Silva (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈfabju peˈɾejɾɐ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ]; born 9 July 1990), known as Fabio, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a full-back for Brazilian club Grêmio. Fabio and his twin brother Rafael began their careers with Fluminense in their native Brazil before being signed by English club Manchester United in February 2007. Unlike his brother, Fabio struggled to hold down a place in the Manchester United first team, and after a loan spell with Queens Park Rangers in 2012–13, he made a permanent move to Cardiff City in January 2014. Fabio has played for Brazil twice at senior international level, with both appearances coming in 2011, the same year he played for Manchester United in the UEFA Champions League Final against Barcelona and won the Premier League title.
