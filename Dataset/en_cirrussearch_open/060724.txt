The Philadelphia Phillies are an American professional baseball team based in Philadelphia. The Phillies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the National League (NL) East Division. Since 2004, the team's home stadium has been Citizens Bank Park, located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. The Phillies have won two World Series championships (against the Kansas City Royals in 1980 and the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008), eight National League pennants (the first of which came in 1915), and made 15 playoff appearances. As the end of the 2023 season, the Phillies have played 21,486 games, with a regular season record of 10,112–11,259–115 (.473). Since the first modern World Series was played in 1903, the Phillies have played 120 consecutive seasons and 140 seasons since the team's 1883 establishment. The Phillies were the last of the 16 pre-expansion teams to win a World Series, with their first championship coming in 1980. Since the start of the Divisional Era in 1969, however, the Phillies have emerged as one of MLB's most successful teams, winning 11 division titles (including five consecutive such titles from 2007 to 2011), eight National League pennants, and two World Series championships. The franchise was founded in Philadelphia in 1883, replacing the team from Worcester, Massachusetts, in the National League. The team has played at several stadiums in the city, beginning with Recreation Park (1883–1886) and continuing at Baker Bowl (1887–1938); Shibe Park (which was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953 in honor of the longtime Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack) (1938–1970); Veterans Stadium (1971–2003), and now Citizens Bank Park (2004–present). The Phillies are the oldest, continuous, one-name, one-city franchise in all of professional sports. Because of, and in spite of, their longevity and rabid fan base, the Phillies are a team historically associated with sadness. They were the first American sports franchise to amass over 10,000 losses; the team holds the world record for most ever losses by a single team in all of professional sports. Yet, also due in part to their longevity, the Phillies are one of only nine teams to have won over 10,000 games in their history. Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt is widely considered the franchise's greatest player of all time. Over the team's history since 1883, 33 Phillies players have been awarded entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame. The Philadelphia Phillies' Triple-A affiliate is the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, who play at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown. The Double-A affiliate is the Reading Fightin Phils, who play in Reading. The Class-A affiliates are the Jersey Shore BlueClaws, who play in Lakewood Township, New Jersey, and the Clearwater Threshers, who play at BayCare Ballpark. The team's spring training facilities are in Clearwater, Florida.
