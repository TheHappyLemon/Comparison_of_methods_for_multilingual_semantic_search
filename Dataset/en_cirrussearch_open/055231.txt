A women's golf tournament was played at the 1900 Summer Olympics. It was the only time women's golf was featured at the Olympics until 2016. There were 10 competitors from 2 nations (France and the United States) at the event, which was played on 3 October at the Compi√®gne Club. The event was won by Margaret Abbott of the United States, the first American woman Olympic champion (though she did not realize it, unaware that the golf tournament was part of the Olympics). The United States is credited with a medal sweep in the event by the IOC, though (i) medals were not awarded at the time and (ii) many sources list Pauline Whittier (the silver medalist) as Swiss or Abbie Pratt as French (or both). Whittier was an American studying in St. Moritz. Pratt was an American who spent significant time in Europe and competed under the auspices of the (French) Dinard Golf Club. Abbott's mother, Mary Abbott also competed in the event; it is the only time that a mother and daughter have competed in the same Olympic event at the same Games.
