Look up roe in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. Roe, (/ro ä/ ROH) or hard roe, is the fully ripe internal egg masses in the ovaries, or the released external egg masses, of fish and certain marine animals such as shrimp, scallop, sea urchins and squid. As a seafood, roe is used both as a cooked ingredient in many dishes, and as a raw ingredient for delicacies such as caviar. The roe of marine animals, such as the roe of lumpsucker, hake, mullet, salmon, Atlantic bonito, mackerel, squid, and cuttlefish are especially rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids, but omega-3s are present in all fish roe. Also, a significant amount of vitamin B12 is among the nutrients present in fish roes. Roe from a sturgeon or sometimes other fish such as flathead grey mullet, is the raw base product from which caviar is made. The term soft roe or white roe denotes fish milt, not fish eggs.
