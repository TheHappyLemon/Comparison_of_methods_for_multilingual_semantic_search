Ridge Racer Unbounded is a racing video game developed by Bugbear Entertainment and published by Namco Bandai Games (under the Namco brand) for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012. It is the eighth installment of the Ridge Racer franchise, and the first game in the series to be released on Windows. Unbounded is also the most recent game in the series to be released on home consoles as its successors only focused on handheld devices. Unbounded marks a departure from the traditional Ridge Racer drifting style, and moved to a more combat-oriented and destructive style, similar to the Burnout series and Split/Second, as well as implementing customizations.
