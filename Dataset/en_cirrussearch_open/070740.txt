Buluan, officially the Municipality of Buluan (Maguindanaon: Inged nu Buluan; Tagalog: Bayan ng Buluan), is a 4th class municipality and capital of the province of Maguindanao del Sur, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 57,406 people. The town was recognized by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of the former Maguindanao province as the new (de jure) provincial capital in 2014, a move seen as the solution to the decades-old issue of Maguindanao's lack of a permanent provincial capitol due to local clan politics. Republic Act No. 11550 officially designated Buluan as the capital of Maguindanao del Sur.
