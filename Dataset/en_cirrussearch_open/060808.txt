Hialeah (/ˌhaɪəˈliːə/ HY-ə-LEE-ə; Latin American Spanish: [xaʝaˈli.a]) is a city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. With a population of 223,109 as of the 2020 census, Hialeah is the sixth-largest city in Florida. It is the second largest city by population in the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida, which was home to an estimated 6,198,782 people at the 2018 census. It is located west-northwest of Miami, and is one of a few places in the county—others being Homestead, Miami Beach, Surfside, Bal Harbour, Sunny Isles Beach, and Golden Beach—to have its own street grid numbered separately from the rest of the county (which is otherwise based on Miami Avenue at Flagler Street in Downtown Miami, the county seat). The city is notable for its high Hispanic proportion, which at 97% is the second-highest proportion of Hispanic Americans of any city in the United States outside of Puerto Rico, and the highest proportion among incorporated communities outside of Puerto Rico. Hialeah also has the highest percentage of Cuban and Cuban American residents of any city in the United States, at 84.1% of the population, making them a prominent feature of the city's culture. Hialeah also has one of the largest Spanish-speaking communities in the country. In 2023, 97% of residents reported speaking Spanish at home, and the language is an important part of daily life in the city. Hialeah is served by the Miami Metrorail at the Okeechobee, Hialeah, and Tri-Rail/Metrorail Transfer stations. The Okeechobee and Hialeah stations serve primarily as park-and-ride commuter stations for commuters and residents going into Downtown Miami, and the Tri-Rail station for Miami International Airport and north to West Palm Beach.
