The 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup was the fifth FIFA Confederations Cup and the third to be organised by FIFA. It was also the first in which the original hosts, Saudi Arabia, did not participate (they were the nation who founded the tournament, previously known as the King Fahd Cup). The tournament was played from 30 May to 10 June 2001, and co-hosted by South Korea and Japan, who were also hosts for the 2002 FIFA World Cup finals. It was won by France, beating hosts Japan 1â€“0, with a goal from Patrick Vieira. By winning the tournament, France became the second team to simultaneously be World Cup champions, continental champions and Confederations Cup winners, after Brazil in 1997. The eight teams were split into two groups of four, in which each team plays each of the others once, with the top two in each group advancing to the semi-finals.
