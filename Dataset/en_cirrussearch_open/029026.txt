The Centennial Hall (Polish: Hala Stulecia [ˈxala stuˈlɛt͡ɕa]; German: Jahrhunderthalle [jaːɐ̯ˈhʊndɐthalə]), formerly named Hala Ludowa ("People's Hall"), is a historic building in Wrocław, Poland. It was constructed according to the plans of architect Max Berg in 1911–1913. Max Berg designed Centennial Hall to serve as a multifunctional structure to host "exhibitions, concerts, theatrical and opera performances, and sporting events". The hall continues to be used for sporting events, business summits, and concerts. As an early landmark of reinforced concrete architecture, the building became one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated 20 April 2005, together with the Four Domes Pavilion, the Pergola, and the Iglica. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland. It was also listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006. The building was used to film scenes of The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. It served as the location of the arena for the 10th annual 'Hunger Games'.
