Metsatöll (from mets – 'forest' and töll – 'four-legged being', used in Western Estonia as a euphemism for "wolf" or "werewolf") is an Estonian heavy metal band formed in 1999. The band has been influenced by many musical groups along with folk units Garmarna, Stille Volk and Estonian folk/classical music composer Veljo Tormis. Much of their material, featuring flutes and other traditional Estonian instruments, is based on the wars for independence of the 13th and 14th centuries.
