Latvia competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. 29 competitors, all men, took part in 16 events in 6 sports. It would be the last time that Latvia would compete at the Summer Games as an independent nation until the 1992 Summer Olympics. After the nation was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, Latvian athletes were forced to compete at the Olympic Games as part of the USSR delegations.
