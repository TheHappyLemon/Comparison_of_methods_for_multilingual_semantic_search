Pope Urban IV (Latin: Urbanus IV; c. 1195 – 2 October 1264), born Jacques Pantaléon, was the head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 29 August 1261 to his death. He was elected pope without being a cardinal; he was the first to be elected in such a way, and this would occur for only 3 more popes afterwards (Gregory X, Urban V and Urban VI).
