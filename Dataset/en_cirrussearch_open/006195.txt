.iq is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Iraq. This domain was in limbo for several years,[clarification needed] as the delegated manager was imprisoned in Texas on charges of alleged connections to Hamas (a State Department designated terrorist organization), for which he was later[clarification needed] convicted in 2005. Some talk of redelegation and relaunching began taking place at the time of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and in 2005 a redelegation to the National Communications and Media Commission of Iraq was approved by ICANN.
