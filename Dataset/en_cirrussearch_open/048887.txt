It Chapter Two is a 2019 American supernatural horror film directed by Andy Muschietti from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman. It is the sequel to It (2017) and the second of a two-part adaptation of the 1986 novel It by Stephen King. The film stars Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, Andy Bean, and Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise. Set 27 years after the events of the previous film, the story centers on the Losers Club and their relationships as they reunite to destroy It once and for all. Talks for an It sequel began in February 2016. By September 2017, New Line Cinema announced that the film would be released in September 2019, with Dauberman writing the script and Muschietti to direct. On a $79 million budget, filming took place from June to November 2018 at Pinewood Toronto Studios, Oshawa, and Toronto. It Chapter Two premiered at the Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles on August 26, 2019, and was released in the United States on September 6 by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its performances (particularly that of Hader and Skarsgård), production design, and themes, but criticized its runtime, pacing and scares, which were unfavorably compared to its predecessor. Despite this, it was a box office success, grossing $473.1 million worldwide against a budget of $79 million.
