SC Dinamo 1948, commonly known as Dinamo București (Romanian pronunciation: [diˈnamo bukuˈreʃtʲ]) or simply Dinamo, is a Romanian professional football club based in Bucharest that competes in the Liga I. Founded in 1948 as the team of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, following the merger of Unirea Tricolor and Ciocanul, Dinamo București has spent all but one year of its history in the top tier of the Romanian league system. Domestically, it is one of the two most successful teams in the country, having won 18 Liga I titles, 13 Cupa României, two Supercupa României, and one Cupa Ligii. In the 1983–84 season, Dinamo became the first club in Romania to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup, being eliminated by Liverpool 1–3 on aggregate. Dinamo București's traditional home colours are white and red, while the current crest is a modified version of the one adopted in the 1998. Its home venue is the namesake Stadionul Dinamo, although significant matches have also been played at Arena Națională. The team temporarily plays its home fixtures at Stadionul Arcul de Triumf, as its home ground undergoes demolition. Its bitter rivals are neighbouring Steaua București, with the matches between the two being commonly referred to as "the Eternal Derby," while notable rivalries against Rapid București and Universitatea Craiova also exist.
