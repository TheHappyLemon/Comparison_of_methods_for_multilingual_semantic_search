Matthew Robert Smith (born 28 October 1982) is an English actor. He initially aspired to be a professional footballer, but spondylolysis forced him out of the sport. After joining the National Youth Theatre and attending the University of East Anglia, Smith became an actor in 2003, performing in London theatres. In the West End, he received critical acclaim for his role in That Face (2007). Smith's first major role in television came in the BBC political drama series Party Animals (2007). He rose to prominence when he starred as the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor in the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who (2010–2014), becoming the youngest person to portray the role. Smith went on to star as Prince Philip in the Netflix historical series The Crown (2016–2017)—for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination—and as Daemon Targaryen in the HBO fantasy drama series House of the Dragon (2022–present).
