Hammarby IF Fotbollförening, more commonly known as Hammarby Fotboll or simply Hammarby (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈhâmːa(r)ˌbyː] or, especially locally, [-ˌbʏ]), is a Swedish professional football club from Stockholm founded in 1915. The club is based at Tele2 Arena in Johanneshov but founded in the neighbouring Södermalm district of Stockholm City Centre, the area that is the club's heartland. Competing in Sweden's first tier, Allsvenskan, Hammarby are placed eighth in the all-time Allsvenskan table, and has won the league once, in 2001. The club has competed in the Svenska Cupen final five times, winning their first title in 2021. The club's colours are green and white, which are reflected in its crest and kit. Between 1918 and 1978, however, the club played in black-and-yellow striped home shirts, which since often form the club's away colors. It is known for its vociferous fans and for having the highest average attendance in the Nordic countries. Drawing inspiration from England, Hammarby fans introduced football chants to the Swedish terraces in 1970.

Hammarby is affiliated with the Stockholms Fotbollförbund (Stockholm Football Association).
