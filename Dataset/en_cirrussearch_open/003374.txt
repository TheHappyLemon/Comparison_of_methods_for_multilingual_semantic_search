"Stickwitu" is a song recorded by American girl group the Pussycat Dolls for their debut studio album PCD (2005). It was written by Franne Golde, Kasia Livingston and Robert Palmer and produced by Ron Fair. A pop ballad with soul influences, the song finds the group celebrating monogamous relationships, with music critics drawing comparisons to fellow girl groups Cover Girls, Sweet Sensation, and the Spice Girls. It was released as the album's second single on September 26, 2005, by A&M Records and Interscope Records. Upon its release, "Stickwitu" received mixed reviews from critics, with some complimenting the production and vocal performances, while others criticized its placement on the album. Commercially, "Stickwitu" was a chart success, peaking at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, as well as becoming the Pussycat Dolls' second consecutive number-one in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and peaking atop the US Mainstream Top 40, making the Pussycat Dolls the first girl group since Destiny's Child in 2001 to do so. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for mastertone sales of one million units. Nigel Dick directed the accompanying music video for "Stickwitu", with principal photography taking place in various places around Los Angeles, including the Orpheum Theatre. With the aim to make each member more identifiable, the music video depicts a day of the group's tour life. To further promote the single, the Pussycat Dolls performed the song during several televised appearances, and in their concert tours PCD World Tour (2006â€“2007) and Doll Domination Tour (2009). The song received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and was regarded as one of the greatest girl group songs of all time by Billboard.
