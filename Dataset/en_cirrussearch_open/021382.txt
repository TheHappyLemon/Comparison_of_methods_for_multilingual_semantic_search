Blue Bloods is an American police procedural drama television series that has been airing on CBS since September 24, 2010. Its main characters are members of the fictional Reagan family, an American, Irish Catholic family in New York City with a history of work in law enforcement. Blue Bloods stars Tom Selleck as New York City Police Commissioner Frank Reagan; other main cast members include Donnie Wahlberg, Bridget Moynahan, Will Estes and Len Cariou for all 13 seasons, plus Amy Carlson (seasons 1-7), and Sami Gayle (seasons 1-10; played by Marlene Lawston in the Pilot). The show is filmed on location in New York City with references to suburban areas as well. The series debuted on September 24, 2010, with episodes airing on Fridays following CSI: NY before being moved to Wednesdays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time and 9:00 p.m. Central and Mountain time for a four-week tryout. After four weeks, it returned to its original Friday 10:00 p.m. Eastern time slot, where it has remained since. On March 29, 2023, CBS announced the show had been renewed for season fourteen. On July 21, 2023, CBS announced the renewed 14th season would be delayed and on hold due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. However, on July 25, 2023, an editor from TV Fanatics stated that the main casts and crew has taken a pay cut for the 14th season to move forward. CBS has yet to confirm this. The 14th season premiered on February 16, 2024. On November 20, 2023, it was announced that the fourteenth season would be its last. The second half of the season, consisting of eight episodes, is scheduled to debut in fall 2024.
