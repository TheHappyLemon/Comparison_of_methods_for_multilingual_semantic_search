Latvian Provisional National Council (Latvian: Latviešu pagaidu nacionālā padome, LPNP) was a political organization established on November 29, 1917 (November 16 in the Julian calendar) in Valka, Governorate of Livonia by the Latvian Refugee Support Central Committee, Latvian political parties and representatives from the Provisional Land Council of Vidzeme and the Provisional Land Council of Latgale. Due to German army advances, the National Council also met in Petrograd, in secrecy from the new Bolshevik regime.
