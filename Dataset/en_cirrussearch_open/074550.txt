Latvian Air Force (Latvian: Latvijas Gaisa spÄ“ki) is the aviation branch of the National Armed Forces. The first air force (AF) units were established in 1992. It has no air combat capability, thus the defense of Latvian air space is maintained by NATO, with rotating detachments of four aircraft to Lithuania at four-monthly intervals (see Baltic Air Policing).
