Torņakalns is a neighbourhood of Riga, Latvia located on the western bank of the Daugava River (neighbourhoods along this shore are collectively known as Pārdaugava). The name Torņakalns (English: Tower Hill) derives from a fortified tower built in the Middle Ages close to the Daugava River to alarm the city of Riga in case of emergency and intruders about to cross the river. The tower does not stand nowadays.
