Viljandi railway station (Estonian: Viljandi raudteejaam) is a railway station serving the town of Viljandi in southern Estonia. The station is the southern terminus of the Tallinn–Viljandi railway line. The station opened in 1897 when a narrow-gauge railway line was opened connecting Mõisaküla with Vijandi, which was prolonged to Tallinn in 1901. The narrow-gauge railway between Mõisaküla og Viljandi was closed in 1973. Currently, the station is owned by the railway infrastructure company Edelaraudtee and served by trains operated by the government-owned passenger train operator Elron.
