Grigor Dimitrov Dimitrov (Bulgarian: Григор Димитров Димитров, pronounced [ɡriˈɡɔr dimiˈtrɔf]; born 16 May 1991) is a Bulgarian professional tennis player. He has been ranked as high as world No. 3 in singles by the ATP, first achieved on 20 November 2017, making him the highest-ranked Bulgarian player in history. Dimitrov reached the ranking after winning the biggest title of his career at the season-ending ATP Finals. He has won nine ATP Tour singles titles to date. Prior to his professional career, Dimitrov enjoyed a successful junior career, in which he reached the world No. 1 ranking and won consecutive major boys' singles titles at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships and the 2008 US Open. In October 2013 at the Stockholm Open, Dimitrov became the first Bulgarian man to win an ATP Tour singles title. As of the 2024 Australian Open, he is the male player with the longest active streak of consecutive Grand Slam appearances, at 52. Dimitrov is the first (and only) Bulgarian male tennis player to reach a final in doubles (in 2011), and to reach the fourth round or better at a major in singles. Dimitrov is the first Bulgarian to qualify for the ATP Finals, which he won in 2017, and to win a Masters title the same year in Cincinnati. Dimitrov has also won more prize money than any other Bulgarian tennis player, being the only male Bulgarian player to reach US$1m and on 6 November 2023 became the 19th male tennis player ever to win $25m. He won the Bulgarian Sportsperson of the Year award in 2014 and 2017, the first and second time a tennis player has won the award since its creation in 1958, and the Balkan Athlete of the Year award in 2017.
