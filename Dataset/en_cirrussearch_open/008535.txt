Aaron Charles Rodgers (born December 2, 1983) is an American football quarterback for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the California Golden Bears (where he set several career passing records, including lowest single-season and career interception rates), before being selected in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers, spending 18 seasons with the team. He is regarded among the greatest and most talented quarterbacks of all time. After backing up Brett Favre for the first three years of his NFL career, Rodgers became the Packers' starting quarterback in 2008. In the 2010 season, he led them to a victory in Super Bowl XLV, earning the Super Bowl MVP. He was named Associated Press Athlete of the Year in 2011, and was voted league MVP by the Associated Press for the 2011, 2014, 2020, and 2021 NFL seasons. Rodgers is the fifth player to win NFL MVP in consecutive seasons, joining Peyton Manning, Favre, Joe Montana and Jim Brown. Rodgers has led the NFL six times in touchdown-to-interception ratio (2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2020, 2021); six times in lowest passing interception percentage (2009, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021); four times in passer rating (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021); and four times in touchdown passing percentage (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021); three times in total touchdowns (2011, 2016, 2020); twice in touchdown passes (2016, 2020) and once in yards per attempt (2011) and completion percentage (2020). Rodgers is first on the NFL's all-time regular-season career passer rating list, with a regular-season career passer rating of over 100 (the first to ever have a career rating over 100) while also having had the highest passer rating, the best touchdown-to-interception ratio and the lowest passing interception percentage in NFL history throughout the entire 2010s decade. In the postseason, he is second in both touchdown passes and touchdown-to-interception ratio, fourth in passing yards, and fifth in all-time passer rating. In the regular season, he has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history at 4.52, holds the league's lowest career interception percentage at 1.4 percent and the highest single-season passer rating record of 122.5. Rodgers is also a four-time winner of the Best NFL Player ESPY Award.
