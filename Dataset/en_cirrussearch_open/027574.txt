Tvorog (Polish: twaróg Russian: творог) is a European, non-liquid, white fermented milk product, traditional for Eastern, Northern and (less often) Central Europe, obtained by fermenting milk with subsequent whey removal. It is officially customary to classify traditionally prepared Tvorog according to its fat content. According to GOST RF, Tvorog is divided based on physical and chemical indicators into the following categories: fat-free, low-fat, classic and fatty. Also, according to the method of manufacture, such types of Tvorog are distinguished as simple, soft, and grained Tvorog, which is a type of low-fat Tvorog. A milk-containing product with a milk fat substitute, produced in accordance with the technology for the production of Tvorog, is called not Творог, but a curd product. In Germany, for example, Quark is produced with linseed oil, which contains less than 0.5% of animal fats, and hence cholesterol, but contains unsaturated fatty acids, such as alpha-linolenic acid. Therefore, such a product may be useful for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. On the territory of the former USSR, Tvorog is made and directly consumed fresh or sweet, in other countries of Eastern and Central Europe - fresh or brackish, in Northern Europe - brackish. Cottage cheese is consumed to a small extent in Great Britain, North America, Japan and is almost completely absent in Southern Europe and other parts of the world. In English-speaking cultures, cottage cheese is considered a type of young soft cheese, while in modern Russian-speaking environments, Tvorog is usually not considered a type of cheese.
