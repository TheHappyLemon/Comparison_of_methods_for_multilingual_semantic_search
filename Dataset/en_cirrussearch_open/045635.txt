Nine is a 2009 romantic musical drama film directed and co-produced by Rob Marshall from a screenplay by Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella, based on the stage musical of the same name, which in turn is based on the 1963 film 8½. In addition to songs from the stage musical, all written by Maury Yeston, the film has three original songs, also written by Yeston (Take It All, Cinema Italiano and Guarda La Luna). The ensemble cast consists of Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Fergie, Kate Hudson, Nicole Kidman, and Sophia Loren. Nine premiered at the Dubai International Film Festival on December 9, 2009, and had a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on December 18, with a wide release in the United States on December 25, by The Weinstein Company. Though the film received mixed reviews from critics, the cast and especially Marion Cotillard's performance was praised. Nine was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actress (Penélope Cruz), Best Art Direction (John Myhre and Gordon Sim), Best Costume Design (Colleen Atwood), and Best Original Song ("Take It All").
