The National Library of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Nacionālā bibliotēka) is a national cultural institution under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture of Latvia. Its current main building is known as the Castle of Light (Latvian: Gaismas pils). The National Library of Latvia was formed in 1919 after the independent Republic of Latvia was proclaimed in 1918. The first supervisor of the Library was Jānis Misiņš, a librarian and the founder of the Latvian scientific bibliography (1862–1945). The current building was designed in 1989 by noted Latvian-American architect Gunnar Birkerts (1925–2017), who immigrated to the United States and made his career there. It was constructed in the early 21st century and opened in 2014. Today, the Library plays an important role in the development of Latvia's information society, providing Internet access to residents and supporting research and lifelong education.
