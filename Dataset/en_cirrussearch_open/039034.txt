The 2017 Critérium du Dauphiné was a road cycling stage race that took place between 4 and 11 June 2017. It was the 69th edition of the Critérium du Dauphiné and was the twenty-third event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. The race was won on the final day by Danish rider Jakob Fuglsang, riding for the Astana team. Having trailed overnight leader Richie Porte (BMC Racing Team) by 75 seconds going into the stage, Fuglsang made his bid for victory by attacking along with AG2R La Mondiale's Romain Bardet and Quick-Step Floors rider Dan Martin on the Col de la Colombière, around 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the finish. They were later caught before the final climb; Fuglsang and Martin went clear again on that climb, with Fuglsang later dropping Martin. Fuglsang remained clear to the finish, winning his second stage of the race by 12 seconds from Martin. Porte ultimately finished the stage in seventh place, 75 seconds behind Fuglsang; however, with bonus seconds in play on the race, Fuglsang's ten-second bonus gave him the race victory by ten seconds over Porte, a first for Denmark at the race. Martin finished third overall, as his six-second bonus allowed him to overtake Chris Froome (Team Sky) by a single second. In the race's other classifications, FDJ rider Arnaud Démare won the points classification while LottoNL–Jumbo rider Koen Bouwman won the mountains classification having won the second and third stages respectively. Bora–Hansgrohe's Emanuel Buchmann won the young rider classification, while AG2R La Mondiale won the teams classification.
