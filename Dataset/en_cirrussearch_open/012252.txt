Visma–Lease a Bike is a Dutch professional bicycle racing team, successor of the former Rabobank. The team consists of four sections: ProTeam (the UCI WorldTeam team), Women's Team (the UCI Women's Team), Development Team (a UCI Continental team racing in the UCI Europe Tour), and cyclo-cross. The cycling team was founded for the 1984 season under the name Kwantum–Decosol, anchored by Jan Raas, with mostly cyclists coming from the TI–Raleigh cycling team. With Raas as directeur sportif from 1985 onwards, the head sponsor was succeeded by Superconfex, Buckler, WordPerfect and Novell, respectively, before Raas signed a contract with Rabobank, a Dutch association of credit unions, in 1996. After Rabobank sponsorship ended in 2012, it was known as Blanco, Belkin, Lotto-Jumbo, Jumbo–Visma and now Visma-Lease a Bike. Since 1984, the team has entered every Tour de France and since the introduction of divisions in 1998, the team has always been in the first division. A 2012 investigation by Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant concluded that doping was at least tolerated, from the team's 1996 beginnings as Rabobank until at least 2007. Team Jumbo-Visma cyclist Jonas Vingegaard won the 2022 Tour de France, delivering the team its first Tour de France victory in the General Classification, as well as the King of the Mountains title while his team-mate Wout van Aert won the Points Classification title. In 2023, Vingegaard repeated his feat and Jumbo-Visma won the team classification for the very first time. That year, fellow Jumbo-Visma riders Primož Roglič and Sepp Kuss also won the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a España respectively, making the team the first to win all three Grand Tours in a single calendar year.
