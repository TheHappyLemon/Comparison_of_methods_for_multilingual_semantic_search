End of Watch is a 2012 American action thriller film written and directed by David Ayer. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña as Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala, two Los Angeles Police Department officers who work in South Central Los Angeles. The film focuses on their day-to-day police work, their dealings with a certain group of gang members, their friendship with each other, and their personal relationships. Ayer, who had written several police procedural films previously, wanted the film to focus more on the friendship between partners and daily police work and subordinate the contextual elements of the drug trafficking story taking place on the streets of south-central LA. Gyllenhaal, Peña, and other cast members underwent an intensive training program to prepare for their roles as police officers. Filming took place in Los Angeles in August 2011 with a budget of $7 million. End of Watch premiered on September 8, 2012, at the Toronto International Film Festival and was released in American theaters on September 21, receiving generally positive reviews and grossing over $57 million at the box office. The film received a number of accolades, including two Independent Spirit Award nominations. As of 2022, a series adaptation of End of Watch is being developed by Fox Entertainment.
