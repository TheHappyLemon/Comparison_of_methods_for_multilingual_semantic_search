Montenegro competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's third consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics since it gained independence from Serbia in 2006. Montenegrin Olympic Committee sent a team of 35 athletes, 18 women and 17 men, to compete in seven different sports at the Olympics, matching the nation's roster size with London 2012. Women's handball and men's water polo were the only team-based sports in which Montenegro had representatives at the Games. Among the sports represented by the athletes, Montenegro marked its Olympic debut in tennis. The Montenegrin team featured a number of returning Olympians; seven of them have attended in every edition of the Games since Montenegro's official debut eight years earlier, including six water polo players, led by captain Predrag Jokić, and half-middleweight judoka Srđan Mrvaljević (men's 81 kg). Meanwhile, handball team captain Bojana Popović, who helped her fellow players deliver a historic silver-medal finish for Montenegro in London four years earlier, became the nation's first ever female athlete to carry the flag in the opening ceremony. Montenegro narrowly missed an opportunity to add another medal to its Olympic treasury in Rio de Janeiro, as the men's water polo team, led by Jokić, lost to the Italians for the bronze with a score 10–12.
