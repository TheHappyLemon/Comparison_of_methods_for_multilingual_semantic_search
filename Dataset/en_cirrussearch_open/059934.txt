Lubań [ˈlubaɲ] (German: Lauban; Czech: Lubáň), sometimes called Lubań Śląski (English: Silesian Lubań; Upper Sorbian: Lubań Šlešćina, pronounced [ˈlubajn ˈʃlɛʃtʃina]); is a town in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship in southwest Poland. It is the administrative seat of Lubań County and also of the smaller Gmina Lubań (although it is not part of the territory of the latter, as the town is a separate urban gmina in its own right).
