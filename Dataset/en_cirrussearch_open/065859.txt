Hypochaeris is a genus of plants in the family Asteraceae. Many species are known as cat's ear. These are annual and perennial herbs generally bearing flower heads with yellow ray florets. These plants may resemble or be confused with dandelions and so some are called false dandelions. Estimates of the number of species range from about 50 up to about 100. Most species are native to South America, but some are found in Eurasia and North Africa.
