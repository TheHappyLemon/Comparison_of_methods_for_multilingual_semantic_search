Vasylkiv maiolica rooster (Ukrainian: Півник васильківської майоліки, romanized: Pivnyk vasylkivskoi maioliky) is a replicated decorative piece produced by the maiolica factory in Vasylkiv, created by Valerii Protoriev and Nadiia Protorieva. It became a symbol of resilience during the Russian invasion of Ukraine after a photo of one of the houses in Borodianka went viral: despite the flat being almost completely destroyed, a kitchen cabinet on the wall survived. Upon closer inspection, a decorative maiolica rooster was noticed atop it.
