Zelenogradsk (Russian: Зеленогра́дск​; German: Cranz; Lithuanian and Old Prussian: Krantas) is a town and the administrative center of Zelenogradsky District in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, located 34 kilometers (21 mi) north of Kaliningrad, on the Sambian coastline near the Curonian Spit on the Baltic Sea. Population: 17,296 (2021 Census); 13,026 (2010 Census); 12,509 (2002 Census); 10,786 (1989 Census). In its heyday, Zelenogradsk (as Cranz) was a popular seaside resort on Germany's eastern Baltic coast, comparable to Bognor Regis in England. However, at the end of World War II, the Soviets took over the town, and much of its tourist traffic has been diverted to nearby Svetlogorsk.
