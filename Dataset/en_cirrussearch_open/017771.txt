PL/SQL (Procedural Language for SQL) is Oracle Corporation's procedural extension for SQL and the Oracle relational database. PL/SQL is available in Oracle Database (since version 6 - stored PL/SQL procedures/functions/packages/triggers since version 7), Times Ten in-memory database (since version 11.2.1), and IBM Db2 (since version 9.7). Oracle Corporation usually extends PL/SQL functionality with each successive release of the Oracle Database. PL/SQL includes procedural language elements such as conditions and loops, and can handle exceptions (run-time errors). It allows declaration of constants and variables, procedures, functions, packages, types and variables of those types, and triggers. Arrays are supported involving the use of PL/SQL collections. Implementations from version 8 of Oracle Database onwards have included features associated with object-orientation. One can create PL/SQL units such as procedures, functions, packages, types, and triggers, which are stored in the database for reuse by applications that use any of the Oracle Database programmatic interfaces. Historically, the first public version of PL/SQL definition was in 1995, and the Oracle's inception year ~1992. It implements the ISO SQL/PSM standard.
