The Czech Republic, presented as Czechia since 2023, has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 11 times since making its debut in 2007. After receiving nul points in the semi-final of the 2009 contest and due to a lack of interest from the Czech public, Czech broadcaster Česká televize (ČT) decided to withdraw from the contest; the country would not participate again until 2015. Since its return to the contest in 2015, the Czech Republic has qualified for the final in five of the last eight contests it has entered, with two top ten finishes: Mikolas Josef's sixth place in 2018 and Vesna's tenth place in 2023. Other finalists included Gabriela Gunčíková, who finished 25th in 2016, Lake Malawi, who finished 11th in 2019, and We Are Domi, who finished 22nd in 2022.
