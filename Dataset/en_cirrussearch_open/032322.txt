The Nokia E65 is a mobile phone in the Eseries range, a S60 platform third edition device with slide action. It shared many of the features of the N95 (quad band GSM, 3G, WiFi, Bluetooth) released around the same time, but thinner, lighter and without the GPS. It was followed fairly quickly by the E66, which was very similar, but gained an FM radio, a newer release of S60, A2DP bluetooth, GPS and 3.2-M pixel camera. Operation times vary depending on the network and usage.
