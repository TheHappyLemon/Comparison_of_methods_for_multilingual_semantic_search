A referendum on the transfer of church property was held in Latvia on 1 and 2 September 1923, the first time a referendum had been held in the country. Voters were asked whether the government should be stopped from transferring the Lutheran St James's Church in Riga to the Roman Catholic Church. Although a large majority voted for the proposal, voter turnout was well below the level required, and the church building was subsequently given to the Catholic Church.
