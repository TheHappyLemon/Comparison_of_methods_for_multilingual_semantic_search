Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea, it was incorporated into Russia's Republic of Crimea. However, a majority of countries recognises the territory as part of Ukraine within the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. It is the administrative center of Krasnoperekopsk Raion. Administratively is not a part of the raion (district) and is incorporated separately as a town of regional significance. Population: 26,268 (2014 Census). It is located on the southern part of the Perekop Isthmus, on the shore of the Stare Lake [uk], and about 124 kilometres (77 mi) from the Crimean capital, Simferopol. It lies on the Dzhankoy-Kherson railroad line (one of the two railroad lines connecting the Crimea and the rest of the continent).
