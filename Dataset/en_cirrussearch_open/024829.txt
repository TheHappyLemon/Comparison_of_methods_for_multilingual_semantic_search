Fauvism (/foʊvɪzəm/) is a style of painting and an art movement that emerged in France at the beginning of the 20th century. It was the style of les Fauves (French for the wild beasts), a group of modern artists whose works emphasized painterly qualities and strong colour over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism. While Fauvism as a style began around 1904 and continued beyond 1910, the movement as such lasted only a few years, 1905–1908, and had three exhibitions. The leaders of the movement were André Derain and Henri Matisse.
