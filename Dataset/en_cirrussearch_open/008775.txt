Abkhazia and South Ossetia are disputed territories in the Caucasus. Most countries recognise them as part of Georgia, while Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Nauru, and Syria regard them as independent. Russia's initial recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia occurred in the aftermath of the Russo-Georgian War in 2008. The government of Georgia considers the republics to be Russian-occupied territories. Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been initially recognised by seven UN member states, until Tuvalu withdrew its recognition of both in 2014, while the status of Vanuatu's recognition of Abkhazia led to confusion between 2011 and 2015. Vanuatu reconfirmed in 2019 it does not support nor recognize the independence of Abkhazia, and supports Georgian territorial integrity including the two disputed territories. Georgia has severed diplomatic relations with the states recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with Syria in 2018 being the most recent example. Abkhazia and South Ossetia recognise each other, and also have some recognition from non-UN member states.
