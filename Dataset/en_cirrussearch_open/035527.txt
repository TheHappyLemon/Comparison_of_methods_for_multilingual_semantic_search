Haas Formula LLC, competing as MoneyGram Haas F1 Team, is an American-licensed Formula One racing team established by NASCAR Cup Series team co-owner Gene Haas in April 2014. The team originally intended to make its debut at the start of the 2015 season but later elected to postpone their entry until the 2016 season. The team principal is Ayao Komatsu, who replaced Guenther Steiner who served in the role from the team's inception until January 2024. The team is headquartered in Kannapolis, North Carolina, United States – 31 mi (50 km) from Charlotte – alongside sister team and NASCAR entrant Stewart-Haas Racing, though the two teams are separate entities. The team also established a forward base in Banbury, England, to turn cars around between races during the European part of the calendar.
