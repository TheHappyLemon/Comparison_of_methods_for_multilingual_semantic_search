SpaceX CRS-25, also known as SpX-25, was a Commercial Resupply Service mission (CRS) to the International Space Station (ISS) that was launched on 15 July 2022. The mission was contracted by NASA and was flown by SpaceX using their reusable spacecraft, the Cargo Dragon. The vehicle delivered supplies to the crew aboard the ISS along with multiple pieces of equipment that will be used to conduct multiple research investigations aboard the ISS. The launch of CRS-25 was delayed to July 11 to investigate issues in the Dragon's propulsion system detected during pre-launch testing. The previously scheduled launch date was June 10.
