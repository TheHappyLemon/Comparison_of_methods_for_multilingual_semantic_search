A three-time Grand Slam doubles champion and 26-time WTA Tour doubles titlist, she reached her career-high doubles ranking of world No. 4 in October 2012. She was also an integral member of the Czech Republic's national team and helped her country to win five titles at the Fed Cup (now Billie Jean King Cup) between 2011 and 2016, in addition to winning two Olympic medals in both women's doubles with Andrea Sestini Hlaváčková in 2012 and in mixed doubles with Radek Štěpánek in 2016.

Five years later, she made her breakthrough at the Grand Slam tournaments when she won her first of two women's doubles major titles at the 2011 French Open with Hlaváčková. In 2012, despite losing her next two major finals, she won the silver medal at the Summer Olympics and won her first WTA Premier 5 (now WTA 1000) title in Cincinnati, both with Hlaváčková. Her continued success led her to a second major title at the US Open in the following year before placing runner-up at the 2016 Australian Open and 2017 US Open. Hradecká was also an accomplished mixed-doubles player, having won the 2013 French Open with František Čermák in addition to reaching two finals at the 2013 Australian Open (with Čermák) and the 2015 French Open (with Marcin Matkowski) and the mixed-doubles bronze in 2016 with Štěpánek.
