Panemunė (pronunciation [ˈpa⁠nɛmunɛ]; German: Übermemel) is the smallest settlement with city status in Lithuania. It is situated on the banks of the Nemunas River opposite Sovetsk, 8 km (5.0 mi) south from Pagėgiai, in Tauragė County. It is a border checkpoint for traffic to and from Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast). The Queen Louise Bridge originally built in 1907 links Panemunė to the city of Sovetsk (Tilsit until 1946) just south across the river. The landmark arch now lies on the Russian side. The city is known as the smallest official city in Lithuania, despite its tiny population.
