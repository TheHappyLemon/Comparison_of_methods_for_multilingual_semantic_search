State Councillor (Russian: статский советник, statskiy sovetnik) was the civil position (class) in the Russian Empire, according to the Table of Ranks introduced by Peter the Great in 1722. That was a civil rank of the 5th class and equal to those of Brigadier in the Army, Captain-Commander in the Navy, and Marshal of the Court (Russia) [Marshal of the Court; Гофинтендантская контора] or Grand Cupbearer in the Court. In 1796, the rank of Brigadier was canceled in the Army, so the rank of State councillor was placed between ranks of Major General and Colonel. Until 1856, the rank gave the right of hereditary nobility; later, that threshold was raised to the 4th class. The rank holder should be addressed as Your High Born (Russian: Ваше Высокородие, Vashe Vysokorodie).
