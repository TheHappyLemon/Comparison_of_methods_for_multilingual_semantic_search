The Faroe pony, Faeroes pony, or Faroese horse, (Føroyska rossið in Faroese) is a small pony, with a height between 11.1 to 12.1 hands (45 to 49 inches, 114 to 124 cm). Technically this animal is a pony due to its height, but in the Faroe Islands it is called a horse because of its strength. The Faroe pony is only to be seen on the Faroe Islands and is therefore little known in other countries. There are only 94 Faroe ponies left living on the Faroe Islands.
