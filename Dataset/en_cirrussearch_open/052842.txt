The Nemzeti Bajnokság (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈnɛmzɛti ˈbɒjnokʃaːɡ], lit. 'national championship'), also known as NB I, is the top flight of Hungarian football league system. The league is officially named OTP Bank Liga after its title sponsor, OTP Bank. Twelve teams compete in the league, playing each other three times, once at home, once away, and the third match is played at the stadium that the last match was not played at. At the end of the season, the top team enters the qualification rounds for the UEFA Champions League, while the runner-up and the third place, together with the winner of the Magyar Kupa enter the UEFA Europa Conference League qualification rounds. The bottom two clubs are relegated to Nemzeti Bajnokság II, the second-level league, to be replaced by the winner and the runner up of the NB2.
