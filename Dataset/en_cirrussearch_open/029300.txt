The Bailiwick of Guernsey (French: Bailliage de Guernesey; Guernésiais: Bailliage dé Guernési) is a self-governing British Crown Dependency off the coast of Normandy, France, comprising several of the Channel Islands. It has a total land area of 78 square kilometres (30 sq mi) and an estimated total population of 67,334. The Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of Normandy, whose dukes became kings of England from 1066. In 1204, as a consequence of the Treaty of Le Goulet, insular Normandy alone remained loyal to the English Crown, leading to a political split from the mainland. Around 1290, the Channel Islands' Governor, Otto de Grandson, split the archipelago into two bailiwicks, establishing those parts other than Jersey as a single Bailiwick of Guernsey.: 21  The Bailiwick is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising three separate jurisdictions: Guernsey (incorporating Herm), Alderney and Sark. The Lieutenant Governor is the representative of the British monarch, who remains the head of state. The States of Guernsey is the parliament and government of the whole Bailiwick, though several matters are decided locally by the States of Alderney and Sark's Chief Pleas. The Bailiff of Guernsey is the civil head of the Bailiwick. They are also president of the States of Guernsey and head of the Bailiwick's judiciary. The Bailiwick is self-governing and not part of the United Kingdom. Its defence and international representation – as well as certain policy areas, such as nationality law – are the responsibility of the UK Government, but the Bailiwick still has a separate international identity.
