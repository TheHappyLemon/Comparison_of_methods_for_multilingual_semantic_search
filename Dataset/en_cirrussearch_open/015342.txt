The little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), also known as dabchick, is a member of the grebe family of water birds. The genus name is from Ancient Greek takhus "fast" and bapto "to sink under". The specific ruficollis is from Latin rufus "red" and Modern Latin -collis, "-necked", itself derived from Latin collum "neck". At 23 to 29 centimetres (9 to 11+1‚ÅÑ2 inches) in length it is the smallest European member of its family. It is commonly found in open bodies of water across most of its range.
