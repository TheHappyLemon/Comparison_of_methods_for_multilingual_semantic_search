Lake Schwerin (German: Schweriner See) is a lake in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, northern Germany. It was named after the city Schwerin, on its southwestern shore. The smaller town Bad Kleinen is on the north shore of the lake. Its surface is approximately 61.54 square kilometres (23.76 sq mi), and its maximum depth is 52.4 metres (172 ft). The natural outflow of the lake is the (channelized) river Stör, a tributary of the Elde, and part of the Elbe watershed. The Wallensteingraben, a 16th-century canal, connects the lake with the Baltic Sea at Wismar.
