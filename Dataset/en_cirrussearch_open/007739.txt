Auseklis is a Latvian god, a stellar deity that represents a celestial body, but possibly not the same as Venus (Rīta zvaigzne) - the first "star" (how Latvians call it) to appear in the mornings on the east side of the sky. He is the third most popular deity in Latvian mythology after Saulė and Mēness, but is almost exclusively mentioned in folk songs.
