It became fully operational in December 2015, linking major railway lines from the north, east, south and west, and replacing the old Wien SÃ¼dbahnhof terminus. With 268,000 daily commuters it is Austria's busiest long-distance railway station. Aside from being voted "Austria's most beautiful railway station" (six times in total; five years in a row),[citation needed] it was also second in Consumer Choice Center's ranking of "Top 10 Railway Stations for Passenger Convenience in Europe".
