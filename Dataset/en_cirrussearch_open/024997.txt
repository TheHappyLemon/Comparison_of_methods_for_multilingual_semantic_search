Bohorodchany raion (Ukrainian: Богородча́нський райо́н, romanized: Bohorodčanśkyj rajon) was a district (raion) of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast in Ukraine. The urban-type settlement of Bohorodchany was the administrative center of the district. The raion was vaguely reminiscent with the Bohorodczan Powiat of the Stanisławów Voivodeship (1920 - 1932). The raion was abolished on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast Oblast to six. The area of Bohorodchany Raion was merged into Ivano-Frankivsk Raion. The last estimate of the raion population was 68,952 (2020 est.).
