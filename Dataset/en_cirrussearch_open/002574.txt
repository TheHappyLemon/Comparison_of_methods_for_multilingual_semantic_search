Malcolm Lincoln was an Estonian band that formed in October 2009. The members are Robin Juhkental, Jakob Juhkam, Siim Raidma, Ott Adamson, Johan Alexander Petti and Hans Kurvits. The original lineup consisted of Robin Juhkental (vocals/electronics) and Madis Kubu (bass). Juhkental has described their style as "electronic pop with a slightly quirky undertone". The band's name originates from the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, where a woman incorrectly answered "Malcolm Lincoln" to a question involving the first name of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. Malcolm Lincoln, together with a group of backing vocalists called Manpower 4, won the competition Eesti Laul 2010 with the song "Siren" and represented Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. The band released their debut album Loaded With Zoul in May 2010.
