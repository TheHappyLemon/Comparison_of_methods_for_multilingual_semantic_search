A sor (Kazakh: сор; Turkmen: шор) is a closed drainless depression characteristic of the Central Asian deserts, found especially in Kazakhstan. The sor area is seasonally flooded, forming a lake, which becomes an inland salt marsh and then a salt flat as it dries. The term forms part of some toponyms of Kazakhstan, such as Altybaysor, Aralsor, Azhibeksor, Karasor, Koksengirsor, Mangisor, Shandaksor, Sholaksor, Sorasha, Sorkol, Shureksor, Tuzdysor and Sor Tuzbair.
