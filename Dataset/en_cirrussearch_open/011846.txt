Ametrine, also known as trystine or by its trade name as bolivianite, is a naturally occurring variety of quartz. It is a mixture of amethyst and citrine with zones of purple and yellow or orange. Almost all commercially available ametrine is mined in Bolivia. The colour of the zones visible within ametrine are due to differing oxidation states of iron within the crystal. The citrine segments have oxidized iron while the amethyst segments are unoxidized. The different oxidation states occur due to there being a temperature gradient across the crystal during its formation. Artificial ametrine is grown with the hydrothermal method using solutions doped with specific elements, followed by irradiation of the created crystals. Ametrine in the low price segment may stem from synthetic material. Green-yellow or golden-blue ametrine does not exist naturally.
