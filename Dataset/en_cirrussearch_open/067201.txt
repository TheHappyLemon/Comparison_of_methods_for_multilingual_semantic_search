The 2023 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships was the 47th edition of the Ice Hockey World Junior Championship, held between December 26, 2022 and January 5, 2023. It was won by Canada, in overtime of the gold-medal game. Czechia won the silver, their first medal since 2005. The venue was originally scheduled to be Novosibirsk and Omsk, Russia, but Russia's hosting rights were pulled in February 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The replacement hosts were Halifax, Nova Scotia and Moncton, New Brunswick, both in Canada. It was the 18th time Canada has hosted the tournament, and the third consecutively. The relegation round was revived, after a two-year hiatus due to the 2021 Division I, II, and III tournaments having been cancelled, and in 2022, both Russia and Belarus were automatically expelled from the competition.
