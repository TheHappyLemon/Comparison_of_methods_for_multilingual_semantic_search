Neurogenic inflammation is inflammation arising from the local release by afferent neurons of inflammatory mediators such as Substance P, Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), neurokinin A (NKA), and endothelin-3 (ET-3). In such neurons, release of these pro-inflammatory mediators is thought to be triggered by the activation of ion channels that are the principal detectors of noxious environmental stimuli. In particular, the heat/capsaicin receptor TRPV1 and the irritant/wasabi receptor TRPA1. TRPA1 channels stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may also cause acute neurogenic inflammation. Once released, these neuropeptides induce the release of histamine from adjacent mast cells. In turn, histamine evokes the release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide; thus, a bidirectional link between histamine and neuropeptides in neurogenic inflammation is established. Neurogenic inflammation appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases including migraine, psoriasis, asthma, vasomotor rhinitis,fibromyalgia, eczema, rosacea, dystonia, and multiple chemical sensitivity. In migraine, stimulation of the trigeminal nerve causes neurogenic inflammation via release of neuropeptides including Substance P, nitric oxide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, 5-HT, Neurokinin A and CGRP. leading to a "sterile neurogenic inflammation."
