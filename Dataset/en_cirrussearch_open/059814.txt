Latvia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 in Liverpool, United Kingdom, with "Aij훮" performed by Sudden Lights. The Latvian broadcaster Latvijas Telev카zija (LTV) organised the national final Supernova 2023 in order to select the Latvian entry for the contest. 14 songs were selected to compete in the national final, which consisted of two shows: a semi-final and a final. In the semi-final on 4 February 2023, ten entries were selected to advance to compete in the final on 11 February 2023 where a public televote and an eight-member jury panel selected "Aij훮" performed by Sudden Lights as the winner. Latvia was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 9 May 2023. Performing during the show in position 4, "Aij훮" was not announced among the top 10 entries of the first semi-final and therefore did not qualify to compete in the final. It was later revealed that Latvia placed 11th out of the 15 participating countries in the semi-final with 34 points.
