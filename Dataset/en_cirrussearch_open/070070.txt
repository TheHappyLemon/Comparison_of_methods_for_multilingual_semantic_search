The Ford S-Max (stylized as Ford S-MAX) is a car produced by Ford Europe for the European market. A multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), Ford also describes the S-Max as an SAV (sports activity vehicle). Introduced at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show, the S-Max went on sale alongside the new generation Galaxy in June 2006. The S-Max is intended to be sporty as a saloon car, and spacious as an MPV. It shows inspiration from the seven-seater large MPV Galaxy, and compact MPV Ford C-Max. The S-Max has received many positive reviews and awards, and was voted European Car of the Year 2007 on 13 November 2006. Ford had plans to sell the S-Max in Japan under the then subsidiary brand Mazda, but they are no longer viable since the latter's split. The S-Max is set to be discontinued in April 2023 alongside the Ford Galaxy. The Ford Fiesta followed in June 2023.
