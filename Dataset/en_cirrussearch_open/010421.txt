Phaseolus vulgaris, the common bean, is a herbaceous annual plant grown worldwide for its edible dry seeds or green, unripe pods. Its leaf is also occasionally used as a vegetable and the straw as fodder. Its botanical classification, along with other Phaseolus species, is as a member of the legume family Fabaceae. Like most members of this family, common beans acquire the nitrogen they require through an association with rhizobia, which are nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The common bean has a long history of cultivation. All wild members of the species have a climbing habit, but many cultivars are classified either as bush beans or climbing beans, depending on their style of growth. The other major types of commercially grown beans are the runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus) and the broad bean (Vicia faba). Beans are grown on every continent except Antarctica. Worldwide in 2022, 28 million tonnes of dry common beans were produced, led by India with 23% of the total. Raw dry beans contain the toxic compound phytohaemagglutinin, which can be inactivated by cooking beans for ten minutes at boiling point (100 °C, 212 °F). The US FDA also recommends an initial soak of at least 5 hours in water which should then be discarded.
