The Mark (from Middle High German: Marc, march, brand) is originally a medieval weight or mass unit, which supplanted the pound weight as a precious metals and coinage weight in parts of Europe in the 11th century. The Mark is traditionally divided into 8 ounces or 16 lots. The Cologne mark corresponded to about 234 grams. Like the German systems, the French poids de marc weight system considered one "Marc" equal to 8 troy ounces.[citation needed] Just as the pound of 12 troy ounces (373 g) lent its name to the pound unit of currency, the mark lent its name to the mark unit of currency.
