Chile lays claim to being one of 14 nations to participate at the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics and made its debut appearance at the 1948 Winter Olympics. The national teams sent by Chile to each of the Olympic Games have been under the auspices of the Chilean Olympic Committee since its inception in 1934 and acceptance by the International Olympic Committee. Previous to the establishment of the Chilean Olympic Committee, athletes were sent to the Olympics under the auspices of the Chilean Athletics Federation. The athletes representing Chile at the Olympics have brought home a total of thirteen medals, with tennis as the top medal-producing sport. Chile has yet to win any medals at the Winter Olympics.
