The Kuwait national football team (Arabic: منتخب الكويت لكرة القدم) is the national team of Kuwait and is controlled by the Kuwait Football Association. Kuwait made one World Cup finals appearance, in 1982, managing one point in the group stages. In the Asian Cup, Kuwait reached the final in 1976 and won the tournament in 1980. Kuwait's 20–0 win over Bhutan in 2000 was, at the time, the biggest-ever margin of victory in international football. It was surpassed in 2001, when Australia defeated American Samoa 31–0. While Kuwait was one of Asia's major football forces from the 1970s to the 2000s, the strength of the national team started to fade slowly from the 2010s, with Kuwait failing in two consecutive Asian Cups in 2011 and 2015, before being disqualified for 2019 edition and missing out on 2023 AFC Asian Cup. The team has also failed to reach any World Cup since 1982.
