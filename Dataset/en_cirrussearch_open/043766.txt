Dreisamstadion is a football stadium in Freiburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It was formerly the home of Bundesliga team SC Freiburg between 1954 and 2021, until a new stadium — the Europa-Park Stadion — was built in October 2021. The stadium holds 24,000 spectators and was built in 1953. It is situated near the Dreisam river, for which it is named. In June 2004 it was given the name of Badenova-Stadion, later Mage Solar Stadion, and for a short time the Stadion an der Schwarzwaldstraße. Due to a sponsorship deal, it was most recently named the Schwarzwald-Stadion. In 2012, modernising the stadium was deemed unprofitable. In February 2015, a referendum was held to determine whether a new stadium should be built and if so, where. The citizens of Freiburg voted in favour of the construction of a new stadium with a capacity of 34,700 at the Wolfswinkel nearby Freiburg's municipal airport. The move to the new stadium occurred in the 2021–22 season.
