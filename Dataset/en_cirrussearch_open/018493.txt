The Ferrari F2007 is a Formula One motor racing car that was constructed by Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro to compete in the 2007 FIA Formula One World Championship. The F2007 was the fifty-third single-seater car which the team have built to use in Formula One. The chassis was designed by Aldo Costa, Simone Resta, Tiziano Battistini, Marco Fainello, John Iley and Marco de Luca with Mario Almondo playing a vital role in leading the production of the car as the team's Executive Technical Director and with Giles Simon in charge of the engine and electronics division assisted by David Salters (engine design and development) and Mattia Binotto (engine operations). As part of new FIA rules for the 2008 season which included banning driver aids via the introduction of a standard ECU for all teams, the F2007 was the last Ferrari Formula One car to use traction control. The car is best known for providing Kimi Räikkönen with his only World Championship title and the team with its first Constructor's title since Michael Schumacher helped them win the 2004 Formula One season. As of 2023[update], this is the last Ferrari F1 car to win the drivers' title. The car was unveiled to the public on January 14, 2007 at Ferrari's Fiorano test track in Maranello, Italy.
