The HESA Shahed 136 (Persian: شاهد ۱۳۶, literally "Witness 136"), or Geran-2 (Russian: Герань-2, literally "Geranium-2") in Russian service, is an Iranian loitering munition in the form of an autonomous pusher-prop drone. It is designed and manufactured by HESA in association with Shahed Aviation Industries.[better source needed] The munition is designed to attack ground targets from a distance, fired in multiples from a launch rack (in batches of five upwards) to overwhelm air defenses by consuming their resources during the attack. The first public footage of the drone was released in December 2021.
