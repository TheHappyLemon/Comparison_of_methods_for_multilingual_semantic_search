The presidency of the Council of the European Union is responsible for the functioning of the Council of the European Union, which is the co-legislator of the EU legislature alongside the European Parliament. It rotates among the member states of the EU every six months. The presidency is not an individual, but rather the position is held by a national government. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "president of the European Union". The presidency's function is to chair meetings of the council, determine its agendas, set a work program and facilitate dialogue both at Council meetings and with other EU institutions. The presidency is currently, as of January 2024, held by Belgium. Three successive presidencies are known as presidency trios. The current trio is made up of Belgium (Januaryâ€“June 2024), Hungary (July-December 2024) and Poland (January-June 2025). The 2020 German presidency began the second cycle of presidencies, after the system was introduced in 2007.
