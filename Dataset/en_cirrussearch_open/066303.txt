Îles de Los [il də lo] are an island group lying off Conakry in Guinea, on the west coast of Africa. Their name is derived from the Portuguese: Ilhas dos Ídolos, "Islands of the Idols". They are located about two kilometres (one nautical mile) off the headland limiting the southern side of Sangareya Bay. The islands are best known for their beaches and forested interiors and are popular with tourists. Ferries sail to the Los from Conakry.
