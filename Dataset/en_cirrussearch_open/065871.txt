The Madonna of Kyiv (Ukrainian: Київська Мадонна) is a photo of a woman nursing a child while taking refuge in the Kyiv Metro, taken in February 2022 in the first days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Taken by a Hungarian journalist András Földes, the photo has become popular on the Internet. It has become an illustration of both a humanitarian crisis and an unjust war. Ukrainian artist Marina Solomenikova drew a portrait based on the photo, which became the inspiration for an icon displayed in a Catholic church in Mugnano di Napoli, Italy, becoming an artistic symbol of resistance and hope.
