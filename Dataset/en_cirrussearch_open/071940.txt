The Action Party (Latvian: Rīcības partija), in 2004-2008 and 2016-2018 Eurosceptic Action Party (Latvian: Eiroskeptiķu Rīcības partija) is a political organization in Latvia. It was founded under the name "Eurosceptics" before the 2003 referendum on Latvia's accession to the European Union, merging the party "Be a Human" (founded in 1998) and the public organization "Movement for Independence". The most prominent representatives of the organization were Normunds Grostiņš (former chairman of the board), artist Juris Dimiters, publicist Jānis Kučinskis and Viktors Dinēvičs. Initially, the party has cooperated with the populist political association "Dzimtene" and the far-left Socialist Party of Latvia, since 2011 it has been operating in the right-wing euro-critical party "European Alliance for Freedom" together with the Austrian Freedom Party and the French National Front.
