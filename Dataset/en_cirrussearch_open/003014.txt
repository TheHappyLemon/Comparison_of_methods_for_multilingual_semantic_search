Robson de Souza (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈʁɔb(i)sõ d(ʒi) ˈsowzɐ]; born 25 January 1984), known as Robinho (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʁɔˈbĩɲu]), is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a forward. In 1999, at 15 years of age, Robinho was picked by Brazil legend Pelé as his heir apparent and, in 2002, went on to lead Santos to their first Campeonato Brasileiro title since Pelé himself played for the club. Afterwards he went on to win a second title with Santos, two more with Spanish club Real Madrid, and the Italian Serie A title in his first season at Milan. At international level, Robinho has won one Copa América title and two FIFA Confederations Cups with the Brazil national team, and played at two FIFA World Cups. In 2017, an Italian court convicted Robinho of sexual assault in the 2013 gang rape of a woman at a Milan nightclub. This conviction was upheld by the Milan Court of Appeals, and subsequently upheld by Italy's top court in January 2022. Italy's request for extradition has been rejected by Brazil, because the Constitution of Brazil does not allow extradition of Brazilian nationals. In March 2024, Robinho was arrested by Brazilian police to serve a nine-year prison term after Brazilian appeals court STJ authorized his Italian conviction to be sentenced and served in Brazil.
