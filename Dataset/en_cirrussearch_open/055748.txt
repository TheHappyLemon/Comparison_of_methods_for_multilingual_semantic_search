The Brussels–Scheldt Maritime Canal (French: Canal maritime de Bruxelles à l'Escaut, Dutch: Zeekanaal Brussel-Schelde), also known as the Willebroek Canal amongst other similar names, is an important canal in Belgium. The 28-kilometre-long (17 mi) canal has a width of 30 metres (98 ft) and a draught of 2 metres (6 ft 7 in), and connects Brussels with the Scheldt river at Wintam and ultimately the sea. The canal is one of the oldest navigable canals in Belgium and indeed in Europe. It was originally only 20 kilometres (12 mi) long and joined the Rupel river in the hamlet of Klein-Willebroek. Hence previously the canal was officially known as the Brussels–Rupel Maritime Canal (French: Canal maritime Bruxelles-Rupel, Dutch: Zeekanaal Brussel-Rupel) prior to the establishment of a direct link with the Scheldt in 1997.
