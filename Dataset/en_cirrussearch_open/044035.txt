Growth (Latvian: Izaugsme) is a centrist political party in Latvia. It was founded on March 27, 2013, by cardiologist Andris Skride. It is governed by a board of five members – Artūrs Ancāns, Artūrs Čačka, Andris Skride, Rita Turkina un Juris Žilko. The party participated in the 2014 Latvian parliamentary elections, placing second-to-last. In March 2018, Growth voted to form the Development/For! party alliance with the liberal For Latvia's Development and Movement For! parties to run in the 2018 Latvian parliamentary election. The alliance won 13 seats in the Saeima, with one seat won by party leader Skride. The alliance became the biggest party at the 2020 Riga City Council elections on a joint list with The Progressives, although none of the four Growth candidates running were elected. The alliance de facto dissolved in 2022.
