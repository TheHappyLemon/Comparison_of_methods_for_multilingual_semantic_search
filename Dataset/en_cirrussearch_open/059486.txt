Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a 2022 action-adventure comedy film based on the video game series published by Sega. It was directed by Jeff Fowler and written by Pat Casey, Josh Miller and John Whittington. Ben Schwartz, James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, Natasha Rothwell, Adam Pally, Lee Majdoub, Colleen O'Shaughnessey and Jim Carrey reprised their roles, with Idris Elba and Shemar Moore joining the cast. In the film, Sonic and Tails must find the Master Emerald before the villain Dr. Robotnik and a new rival, Knuckles the Echidna. Following the success of Sonic the Hedgehog (2020), Paramount Pictures announced the sequel in May 2020, with Fowler, Casey, Miller and the cast returning. Filming took place from March to June 2021 in Vancouver and Hawaii. The film draws inspiration from the video games Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992), Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), and Sonic & Knuckles (1994). Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was theatrically released in several markets on March 30, 2022, and in the United States on April 8, by Paramount Pictures and Sega Sammy Group. Like its predecessor, it set several box office records and received positive reviews. It grossed $405.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing video game film in the United States until The Super Mario Bros. Movie the following year. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is scheduled for 2024, while Knuckles, a spin-off series starring Elba, is scheduled to premiere on Paramount+ in early 2024.
