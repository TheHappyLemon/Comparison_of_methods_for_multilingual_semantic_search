Uvs Lake (Mongolian: Увс нуур, romanized: Uws nuur, pronounced [ʊw̜s ˈnʊːr]; Russian: Озеро Убсу-Нур, romanized: Ozero Ubsu-Nur) is a highly saline lake in an endorheic basin—Uvs Nuur Basin, primarily in Mongolia with a smaller part in Russia. It is the largest lake in Mongolia by surface area, covering 3,350 km2 at 759 m above sea level. The northeastern tip of the lake is situated in the Tuva Republic of the Russian Federation. The largest settlement near the lake is Ulaangom. This shallow and very saline body of water is a remainder of a huge saline sea which covered a much larger area several thousand years ago.
