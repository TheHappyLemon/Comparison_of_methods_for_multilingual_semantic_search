Jonathan Lyndale Kirk (born December 22, 1991), known professionally as DaBaby, formerly known as Baby Jesus, is an American rapper. After releasing several mixtapes between 2014 and 2018, he signed to Interscope Records in January 2019 in a joint venture with the North Carolina-based record label, South Coast Music Group. He released his debut studio album, Baby on Baby (2019) to belated commercial success, later receiving support from the Billboard Hot 100-top ten single "Suge" a month after its release. His second studio album, Kirk (2019) debuted atop the Billboard 200 and spawned the hit singles "Intro" and "Bop". That same year, he guest featured on the singles "Enemies" by Post Malone and "Cash Shit" by Megan Thee Stallion. His third studio album, Blame It on Baby (2020) became his second to peak the chart and spawned the single "Rockstar" (featuring Roddy Ricch), which spent seven non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in the wake of the year's George Floyd protests. Furthermore, it received quintuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and earned a Grammy Award nomination for Record of the Year. In 2020, he guest performed on the remix of "Whats Poppin" by Jack Harlow and the single "Levitating" by Dua Lipa, both of which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Following public controversies regarding homophobia, he released the collaborative mixtape Better than You (2022) with YoungBoy Never Broke Again and his fourth album, Baby on Baby 2 (2022).
