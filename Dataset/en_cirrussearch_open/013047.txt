Barry Island is an island lying in the centre of the Debenham Islands, off the west coast of Graham Land in Antarctica. Barry Island was charted by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) under John Riddoch Rymill, who used Barry Island for a base in 1936 and 1937. Barry Island was named by John Riddoch Rymill for Kenneth Barry Lempriere Debenham (1920–43), the eldest son of Frank Debenham, member of the British Graham Land Expedition Advisory Committee (BGLE Advisory Committee). The Argentinian base San Martín is located on this island.
