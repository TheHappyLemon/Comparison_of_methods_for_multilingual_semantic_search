Hercules is a prominent crater located in the northeast part of the Moon, to the west of the crater Atlas. It lies along the east edge of a southward extension in the Mare Frigoris. To the west across the mare is BÃ¼rg. To the south is the ruined crater Williams. The interior walls of Hercules have multiple terraces, and there is a small outer rampart. The crater floor has been flooded by lava in the past, and contains several areas of low albedo. The central peak has been buried, leaving only a low hill near the midpoint. The satellite crater Hercules G is located prominently just to the south of the center. The small crater Hercules E lies along the southern rim of Hercules. Hercules is a crater of Eratosthenian age. The name Hercules was formally recognized by the IAU in 1935. In the past this crater has been reported as the site of some transient lunar phenomenon.[according to whom?]
