Lysychansk (/ˌlɪsɪˈtʃænsk/ LIH-sih-CHANSK, /-ˈtʃɑːnsk/ -⁠CHAHNSK; Ukrainian: Лисича́нськ, IPA: [lɪsɪˈtʃɑnʲsʲk] ; Russian: Лисича́нск, romanized: Lisichansk IPA: [lʲɪsʲɪˈtɕansk]), is a city in Sievierodonetsk Raion, Luhansk Oblast, eastern Ukraine. It is located on the high right bank of the Donets River, approximately 115 kilometres (71 mi) from the administrative center of the oblast, Luhansk. It faces Sievierodonetsk across the river. Its population before the Russian invasion of Ukraine was approximately 93,340 (2022 estimate). Prior to Ukrainian 2020 municipal classification reforms, Lysychansk was incorporated as a city of oblast significance. Up to 2022, the administration of Lysychansk Municipality included the settlements of Novodruzhesk and Pryvillia. Along with the cities of Sievierodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna and the nearest towns, the Lysychansk area constituted a major urban and industrial hub of the Donbas region, with a 2009 population of about 353,000. The city became the site of 2022's Battle of Lysychansk, which ended with the capture of the city by Russian forces and the Luhansk People's Republic on 2 July. Up to 12,000 were estimated to have remained in the city, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russia has claimed the city following its declared annexation of the region in September 2022.
