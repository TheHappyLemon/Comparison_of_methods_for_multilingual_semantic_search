Army general (Russian: Генера́л а́рмии, romanized: Generál ármii) is the second highest military rank in Russia, subordinate only to a marshal and superior to a colonel general. It is a direct counterpart of the Soviet Army General rank. At present it is also the highest rank in the air force, artillery, aerospace defense forces, armored troops, engineer troops and signal troops, unlike the Soviet Union where similarly ranked officers were called marshals and chief marshals of a branch. The corresponding naval rank is admiral of the fleet. On appointment as Defence Minister on 7 May 1992, Pavel Grachev was the first officer to be promoted to this rank. Vladimir Yakovlev was promoted to this grade while serving as commander of the Strategic Missile Forces (1997–2001).
