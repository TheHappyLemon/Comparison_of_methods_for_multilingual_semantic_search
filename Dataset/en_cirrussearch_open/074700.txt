Africa Eco Race is an annual rally raid, organised in France and run in North and West Africa, launched after the cancellation of 2008 Dakar Rally, and the subsequent moving of the rally to South America. The rally claims to have innovated to give a special focus on security issues and sustainable development. In addition to the sporting aspect, the rally aims to put emphasis on individual awareness about eco-responsibility. Bivouacs are chosen far from cities and airport tarmac.
