"Du riechst so gut" (German: [duː ˈʁiːçst zoː ˈɡuːt], "you smell so good") is a song by German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein. It was released the band's first single on 24 August 1995, also acting as the lead single from their debut studio album, Herzeleid (1995). The song describes the inner thoughts of a predator hunting his prey. The title is said to be inspired by Patrick Süskind's Perfume, a favourite novel of Till Lindemann's, the band's lead singer. The single was re-released in 1998 under the name "Du riechst so gut '98", featuring a different edit of the song and a new music video.
