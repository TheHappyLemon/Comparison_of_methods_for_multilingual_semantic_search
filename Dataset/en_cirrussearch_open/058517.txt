The Balto-Slavic languages form a branch of the Indo-European family of languages, traditionally comprising the Baltic and Slavic languages. Baltic and Slavic languages share several linguistic traits not found in any other Indo-European branch, which points to a period of common development and origin. A Proto-Balto-Slavic language is reconstructable by the comparative method, descending from Proto-Indo-European by means of well-defined sound laws, and from which modern Slavic and Baltic languages descended. One particularly innovative dialect separated from the Balto-Slavic dialect continuum and became ancestral to the Proto-Slavic language, from which all Slavic languages descended. While the notion of a Balto-Slavic unity was previously contested largely due to political controversies, there is a general consensus among academic specialists in Indo-European linguistics to classify Baltic and Slavic languages into a single branch, with only some minor details of the nature of their relationship remaining in contention.
