An alphabet book is a type of children's book giving basic instruction in an alphabet. Intended for young children, alphabet books commonly use pictures, simple language and alliteration to aid language learning. Alphabet books are published in several languages, and some distinguish the capitals and lower case letters in a given alphabet. Some alphabet books are intended for older audiences, using the simplicity of the genre as a device to convey humor or other concepts.
