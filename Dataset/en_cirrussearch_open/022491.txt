The province of Livorno (Italian: provincia di Livorno) or, traditionally, province of Leghorn, is a province in the Tuscany region of Italy. It includes several islands of the Tuscan Archipelago, including Elba and Capraia. Its capital is the city of Livorno. When formed in 1861, the province included only Livorno and Elba Island. It was extended in 1925 with land from the provinces of Pisa and Genoa. It has an area of 1,211 square kilometres (468 sq mi) and a total population of 343,003 (2012). The province contains 19 comuni (sg.: comune). The coastline of the area is known as "Costa degli Etruschi" (English: "Etruscan Coast"). The province of Livorno is coastal and contains a number of coastal towns. Livorno is a highly important port for tourism and trading, and a number of watchtowers are located nearby the city. At Calafuria, the sea contains sponges, shellfish, fish, and protected red coral (Corallium rubrum). The coastlines of Quercianella and Castiglioncello are rocky. The waters around the province of Livorno sometimes contain dolphins. The town Marina di Bibbona was initially founded as a fort due to its strategic coastal position. Town San Vincenzo contains a fourteenth-century tower for strategic reasons. The sand of Golfo di Baratti is silver and black due to its high iron concentration, and the area contains an archaeological park.
