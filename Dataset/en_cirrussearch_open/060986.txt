Branko Đurić (Cyrillic: Бранко Ђурић; born 28 May 1962), also known by his nickname Đuro (Cyrillic: Ђуро), is a Bosnian actor, comedian, film director and musician, who lives and works in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Born and raised in Sarajevo, Đurić rose to prominence throughout Yugoslavia with the hit comedy series Top lista nadrealista during the 1980s. Đuro became something of an epitome for the Bosnian people, primarily due to his accent and slang. He was also one of the founding members of SCH and the frontman of the award-winning Sarajevo rock band Bombaj Štampa. In August 1992, several months into the Bosnian War, he moved to Slovenia where he has been residing ever since. He has starred in the Academy Award-winning film No Man's Land and has had supporting roles in numerous high-profile films, including The Smell of Quinces, Time of the Gypsies, Kuduz, Bal-Can-Can, In the Land of Blood and Honey and See You in Montevideo. He has also created the comedy series Naša mala klinika, which has spawned an entire franchise with Slovenian, Croatian and Serbian counterparts.
