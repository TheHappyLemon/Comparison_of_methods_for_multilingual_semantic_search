A platform supply vessel (PSV) is a ship specially designed to supply offshore oil and gas platforms and other offshore installations. They typically range from 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330Â ft) in length and are distinguished by the large open deck area used to store supplies and house equipment and to allow for efficient loading and offloading. The primary function for most of these vessels is logistic support and transportation of goods, tools, equipment, and personnel to and from their destination. They belong to the broad category of offshore vessels (OSVs) which includes Service Operation Vessels (SOVs), Construction Support Vessels (CSVs), well stimulation vessels (WSVs) and anchor handling tug supply vessels (AHTSVs).
