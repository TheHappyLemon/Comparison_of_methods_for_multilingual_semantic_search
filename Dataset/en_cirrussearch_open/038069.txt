The 2017 Tour of the Basque Country was a road cycling stage race that took place between 3 and 8 April. It was the 57th edition of the Tour of the Basque Country and was the fourteenth event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. The race was won for the first time by Alejandro Valverde of the Movistar Team, who took the race lead on the penultimate day after winning the queen stage in Eibar, before further extending the lead by finishing second in the final-day individual time trial; Valverde's finishes on those stages aided him to take the points classification from Team Sunweb's Michael Matthews at the death. Valverde finished 17 seconds clear of four-time race winner Alberto Contador (Trek–Segafredo) while the all-Spanish podium was completed by the national time trial champion, Ion Izagirre, a further four seconds in arrears of Contador for the Bahrain–Merida team. In the race's other classifications, Cannondale–Drapac's Alex Howes won the polka-dot jersey as winner of the mountains classification, Lluís Mas (Caja Rural–Seguros RGA) was the winner of the intermediate sprints classification while Bahrain–Merida won the teams classification.
