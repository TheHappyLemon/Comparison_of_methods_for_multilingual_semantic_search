James Connolly Johnstone (30 September 1944 â€“ 13 March 2006) was a Scottish footballer who played as an outside right. Known as "Jinky" for his elusive dribbling style, Johnstone played for Celtic for 13 years, and was part of the 'Lisbon Lions', the team who won the 1967 European Cup Final, as well as winning nine consecutive Scottish championships. He scored 129 goals for Celtic in 515 appearances and was voted the club's greatest ever player by fans in 2002. Johnstone also won 23 caps for Scotland. He finished third in voting for the 1967 Ballon d'Or, and was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame when it was inaugurated in 2004.[citation needed] Rodger Baillie[who?] called Johnstone a "genius who lived by magic and mischief", while Hugh McIlvanney wrote that no other player "besieged opponents with such a complex, concentrated swirl of deceptive manoeuvres or ever conveyed a more exhilarating sense of joy in working wonders with the ball."
