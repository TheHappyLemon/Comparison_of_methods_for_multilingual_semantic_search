Kevin Wimmer (German pronunciation: [ˈkɛvɪn ˈvɪmɐ]; born 15 November 1992) is an Austrian professional footballer who plays as a centre back for Slovan Bratislava. Wimmer began his professional career with LASK where his performances earned him a move to German club 1. FC Köln in June 2012. In the 2013–14 season, Wimmer helped Köln set a new 2. Bundesliga record, conceding only 20 goals as they earned promotion to the Bundesliga. After a solid first season in the German top flight he moved to Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £4.3 million. However his playing time under Mauricio Pochettino at White Hart Lane was restricted due to the form of Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen. After two seasons in North London, Wimmer joined Stoke City in August 2017 for a fee of £18 million. He struggled for game time at Stoke and joined Hannover 96 on loan for the 2018–19 season, Belgian side Royal Excel Mouscron in 2019–20 and Karlsruher SC in 2020–21.
