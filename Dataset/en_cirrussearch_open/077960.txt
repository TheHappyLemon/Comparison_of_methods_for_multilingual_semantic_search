There are many widely varying names of Germany in different languages, more so than for any other European nation. For example: the German language endonym is Deutschland, from the Old High German diutisc the French exonym is Allemagne, from the name of the Alamanni tribe In Italian it is Germania, from the Latin Germania, although the German people are called tedeschi in Polish it is Niemcy, from the Proto-Slavic nemets, referring to strangers, incomprehensible to Slavic speakers the Finnish called the country Saksa, from the name of the Saxon tribe. Often language lags behind the changing society and names tend to retain references to first encounters: the Finnish first and foremost met the Saxons while the French faced the Alamanni. Comparable tendencies appear elsewhere, e.g. in names for Russia. Each of the names for Germany has been adapted into other languages all over the world.
