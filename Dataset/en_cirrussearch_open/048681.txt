Republic of Macedonia, under the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia), competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. The Olympic Committee of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia selected a team of six athletes, two men and four women, to compete in four different sports at these Games. For the first time in Olympic history, Macedonia was represented by more women than men. Five Macedonian athletes made their Olympic debut in Rio de Janeiro, with individual medley swimmer Marko Bla≈æevski returning for his second appearance from London 2012. Joining him was freestyle swimmer Anastasia Bogdanovski, who set a historic milestone as Macedonia's first female flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Macedonia, however, failed to earn a single Olympic medal for the fourth consecutive in a row.
