Clément Armand Fallières (French pronunciation: [aʁmɑ̃ faljɛʁ]; 6 November 1841 – 22 June 1931) was a French statesman who was President of France from 1906 to 1913. Clément Armand Fallières was a symbol of republicanism in the French Third Republic. He was born into a middle-class family in Lot-et-Garonne and became a lawyer and a Republican politician. He held various ministerial posts and was briefly prime minister in 1883. He had a moderate and sensitive approach to the religious problem, but was tough in dealing with labor unrest. In 1906, he became president of France, defeating Paul Doumer. According to David Bell, he had a talent for spotting political talent. His presidency was marked by his genial and reassuring manner, making him a popular figurehead. He was content with the procedural honors of a constitutional president and let his ministers make the decisions. His presidency emphasized the Senate's republicanism. He had the honour, though not the power, of presiding over the left-wing governing coalition known as the bloc des gauches ("left bloc").
