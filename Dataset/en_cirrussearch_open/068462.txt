On 26 July 2023, a coup d'état occurred in Niger when the country's presidential guard detained President Mohamed Bazoum, and Presidential Guard commander General Abdourahamane Tchiani proclaimed himself the leader of a new military junta, shortly after confirming the coup a success. This was the fifth military coup d'état since the country gained independence from France in 1960, and the first since 2010. The coup was condemned by the United States and France, and by the West African regional bloc ECOWAS, the latter of which threatened military intervention against the junta, leading to the 2023 Nigerien crisis.
