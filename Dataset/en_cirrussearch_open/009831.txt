Joseph Gilles Henri Villeneuve (French pronunciation: [ʒil vil.nœv]) (January 18, 1950 – May 8, 1982) was a Canadian racing driver who spent six years in Formula One racing for Scuderia Ferrari, winning six Grands Prix and earning widespread acclaim for his performances. An enthusiast of cars and fast driving from an early age, Villeneuve started his professional career in snowmobile racing in his native province of Quebec. He moved into single seaters, winning the US and Canadian Formula Atlantic championships in 1976, before being offered a drive in Formula One with the McLaren team at the 1977 British Grand Prix. He was taken on by reigning world champions Ferrari for the end of the season and drove for the Italian team from 1978 until his death in 1982. Villeneuve won six Grand Prix races in a short career at the highest level, and claimed second, his highest finish, in the 1979 Formula One World Championship; four points behind teammate Jody Scheckter. Villeneuve died in a 140 mph (230 km/h) crash resulting from a collision with the March car driven by Jochen Mass during qualifying for the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder. The accident came less than two weeks after an intense argument with his teammate Didier Pironi over Pironi's move to pass Villeneuve at the preceding San Marino Grand Prix. At the time of his death, Villeneuve was extremely popular with fans and has since become an iconic figure in the history of the sport. His son, Jacques Villeneuve, became Formula One World Champion in 1997, to date the only Canadian to win the Formula One World Championship.
