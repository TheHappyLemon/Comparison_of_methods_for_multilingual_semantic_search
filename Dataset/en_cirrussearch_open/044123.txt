Tauheed K. Epps (born September 12, 1977), known professionally as 2 Chainz (formerly Tity Boi), is an American rapper. Born and raised in College Park, Georgia, he initially gained recognition as one-half of the Southern hip hop duo Playaz Circle, alongside hometown rapper Earl "Dolla Boy" Conyers. The duo signed with fellow Georgia-based rapper Ludacris' Disturbing tha Peace label, and became best known for their 2007 debut single "Duffle Bag Boy" (featuring Lil Wayne). In February 2012, Epps signed a solo recording contract with Def Jam Recordings, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. In April of that year, his guest performance on Kanye West's single, "Mercy" marked his first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 as a solo act, peaking at number 13. In the following months, his singles "No Lie" (featuring Drake) and "Birthday Song" (featuring Kanye West) were released to continued success; both of which received double platinum certifications by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and preceded the release of his debut studio album, Based on a T.R.U. Story in August of that year. Despite mixed critical reception, it peaked atop the Billboard 200 and spawned the top 40 single "I'm Different". His second album, B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time (2013) was led by the single "Feds Watching" (featuring Pharrell Williams), and saw improved critical reception despite a slight commercial decline. Epps has since released the albums ColleGrove (2016), Pretty Girls Like Trap Music (2017), Rap or Go to the League (2019), So Help Me God! (2020), and Dope Don't Sell Itself (2022).
