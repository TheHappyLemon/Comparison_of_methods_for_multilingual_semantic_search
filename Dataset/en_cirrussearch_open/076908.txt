Miley Ray Cyrus (/ˈmaɪli ˈsaɪrəs/, MY-lee SY-rəs; born Destiny Hope Cyrus, November 23, 1992) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She has been recognized for her evolving artistry and hailed as the "Teen Queen" of the 2000s era. She is also cited as one of the few examples of a child star with a successful music career as an adult. As the daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, she emerged as a teen idol at age 13 as the lead character in the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana (2006–2011). As Hannah Montana, she achieved success on the Billboard charts with two number-one soundtracks and a US top-ten single. Her solo career started with the US number-one albums Meet Miley Cyrus (2007) and Breakout (2008); featuring the top-ten singles "See You Again" and "7 Things". The EP The Time of Our Lives (2009) reached number two in the US while its lead single "Party in the U.S.A." became one of the best-selling singles of all time in the country and was later certified diamond by the RIAA. The ballad "The Climb", also reached number four in the US. Trying to recalibrate her image, she explored dance-pop in Can't Be Tamed (2010), which received mixed reviews; however, its title track reached the top-ten in the US. She later signed with RCA Records and took a new artistic direction with the hip-hop and R&B-influenced Bangerz (2013), which became her fifth chart-topping album. Featuring the singles "We Can't Stop" and her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one "Wrecking Ball", it earned Cyrus her first Grammy Award nomination. She then dabbled in diverse genres with albums like Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015), Younger Now (2017) and Plastic Hearts (2020). After signing with Columbia Records in 2021, Cyrus released Endless Summer Vacation (2023). Its lead single "Flowers" set various records and marked her second US number-one. The song won two Grammy Awards including Record of the Year and the album was nominated for Album of the Year. Apart from music, Cyrus starred in the films Bolt (2008), Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009), The Last Song (2010), LOL (2012), and So Undercover (2013), and appeared briefly in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) and Drive-Away Dolls (2024). On television, she led and produced the documentary, Miley: The Movement (2013), served as a coach on The Voice (2016–2017), starred in the "Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too" episode from the Netflix series Black Mirror (2019), hosts the yearly NBC holiday special Miley's New Year's Eve Party (2021–present), and starred in and executive produced the Disney+ documentary concert special, Endless Summer Vacation (Backyard Sessions) (2023). In 2014, she founded the non-profit Happy Hippie Foundation, which was supported by the web video series Backyard Sessions (2012–2023). Cyrus has received numerous accolades, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, five Billboard Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, and eight Guinness World Records. She has appeared in listicles such as the Time 100 (2008 and 2014) and Forbes 30 Under 30 (2014 and 2021).
