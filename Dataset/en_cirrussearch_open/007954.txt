Following the implementation on 1 September 2019 of the Kleisthenis I Programme, the administrative divisions of Greece consist of two main levels: the regions and the municipalities. In addition, a number of decentralized administrations overseeing the regions exist as part of the Ministry of the Interior, but are not part of local government. The old prefectures were either abolished and divided or transformed into regional units in 2011 by Kallikratis Plan. The administrative regions are divided into regional units which are further subdivided into municipalities. The Eastern Orthodox monastic community on Mount Athos is an autonomous self-governing entity.
