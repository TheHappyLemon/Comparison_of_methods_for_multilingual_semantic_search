José de Amézola y Aspizua (Basque: José Ametzola Aspizua; 9 January 1874 – 1922) was a Spanish Basque pelotari who competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. Amezola entered in the only official pelota contest in Olympic history, the Basque pelota at the 1900 Summer Olympics two-man teams event. He and his partner Francisco Villota defeated the French team, Maurice Durquetty and Etchegaray, by default (walkover). This was Spain's first ever Olympic Medal.
