The English Football League One, known as Sky Bet League One for sponsorship purposes or simply League One in England, is the second-highest division of the English Football League and the third-tier overall in the English football league system. Introduced in the 2004–05 English football season as Football League One, it is a rebrand of the former Football League Second Division, which itself is a rebrand of the now-defunct Football League Third Division before the 1992 launch of the Premier League. As of the 2023–24 season, Fleetwood Town holds the longest tenure in the division following promotion from League Two at the end of the 2013–14 season. There are eight former Premier League clubs currently competing in this division; Barnsley (1997–98), Blackpool (2010-11), Bolton Wanderers (1995–96, 1997–98 and 2001–12), Charlton Athletic (1998–99 and 2000–07), Derby County (1996–2002 and 2007–08), Portsmouth (2003–10), Reading (2006–08 and 2012–13) and Wigan Athletic (2005–13).
