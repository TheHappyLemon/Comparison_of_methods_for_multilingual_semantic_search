The men's standing long jump was a track & field athletics event at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. It was held on July 16, 1900. Four athletes from two nations competed in the standing long jump. The event was won by Ray Ewry of the United States, with his teammate Irving Baxter the runner-up; the two dominated all three of the standing jumps in 1900, finishing first and second in each. Ewry would take gold medals in all eight standing jump events from 1900 to 1908 (as well as both events at the 1906 Intercalated Games). The bronze medal was won by Émile Torchebœuf of France.
