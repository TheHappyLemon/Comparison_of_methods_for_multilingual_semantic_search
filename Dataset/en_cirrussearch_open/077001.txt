Nicosia (/ˌnɪkəˈsiːə/), also known by its Greek name Lefkosia (Λευκωσία; pronounced [lɛfko'siɐ]), its Turkish name Lefkoşa (pronounced [lefkoʃa]), and by several other names, is the capital and largest city of Cyprus. Nicosia is the southeasternmost of all EU member states' capitals. It has been continuously inhabited for over 4,500 years and has been the capital of Cyprus since the 10th century. The Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities of Nicosia segregated into the south and north of the city respectively in early 1964, following the fighting of the Cyprus crisis of 1963–64 that broke out in the city. This separation became a militarized border between the Republic of Cyprus and Northern Cyprus after Turkey invaded the island in 1974 following an attempt at Enosis. Apart from its legislative and administrative functions, Nicosia has established itself as the island's financial capital and its main international business center. In 2018, Nicosia was the 32nd richest city in the world in relative purchasing power.
