Loaded is the fourth studio album by the American rock band the Velvet Underground, released in November 1970 by Atlantic Records subsidiary Cotillion. It was the final album recorded featuring the bandâ€™s remaining original members, including the lead singer and primary songwriter Lou Reed, who left the band shortly before the album's release, and the guitarist Sterling Morrison, who left the band in 1971 along with the drummer Maureen Tucker. For this reason, it is often considered by fans to be the last "true" Velvet Underground album. The multi-instrumentalist Doug Yule remained and released the album Squeeze in 1973 before the band's dissolution the same year. Despite having a number of singles originate from it, the album itself failed to chart. It has retrospectively gained critical acclaim; Loaded was ranked number 110 in 2012, and ranked number 242 in 2020, on Rolling Stone's list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".
