The Vistula Spit canal (Polish: Kanał przez Mierzeję Wiślaną), officially known as the Nowy Świat ship canal (Polish: Kanał żeglugowy Nowy Świat), is a canal across the Polish section of the Vistula Spit that creates a second connection between the Vistula Lagoon and Gulf of Gdańsk. It allows ships to enter the Vistula Lagoon and the port of Elbląg without having to rely on the Russian Strait of Baltiysk, saving a 100-kilometre (62 mi) journey. Its construction started in February 2019. It is 1,305 m (4,281 ft) in length and allows ships of draft up to 4 m (13 ft), length up to 100 m (330 ft), and beam up to 20 m (66 ft) to pass through. The canal was officially inaugurated on 17 September 2022. Further works will continue. The canal is located between the villages of Skowronki and Przebrno, at the site of an abandoned settlement called Nowy Świat, hence its official name.
