Kennedy Channel (Danish: Kennedykanalen; French: Passage Kennedy; 80°55′N 66°30′W﻿ / ﻿80.917°N 66.500°W﻿ / 80.917; -66.500﻿ (Kennedy Channel)) is an Arctic sea passage between Greenland and Canada's most northerly island, Ellesmere Island. It was named by Elisha Kane around 1854 during his second Arctic voyage in search of the lost Franklin expedition. It is not entirely clear, however, for which Kennedy he named the channel. Kane may have had his fellow explorer William Kennedy in mind, whom he had met a few years previously while both were involved in earlier searches for Franklin's expedition. However, most historians believe it was named for John Pendleton Kennedy, the United States Secretary of the Navy during 1852 to 1853, under whose direction Kane's second Arctic voyage took place.
