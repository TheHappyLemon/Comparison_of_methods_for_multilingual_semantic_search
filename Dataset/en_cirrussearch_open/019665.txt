Eumerus strigatus, (Fall√©n, 1817), the Onion Bulb Fly, is a fairly common species of syrphid fly observed across Europe. Also found in north-central North America and other scattered locations as an introduced species from infested bulbs. Syrphid flies are also known as hover flies or flower flies because the adults are frequently found hovering around flowers from which they feed on nectar and pollen. The larvae feed on various bulbs.
