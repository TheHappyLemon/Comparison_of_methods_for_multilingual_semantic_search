David Ferrer Ern (Valencian pronunciation: [daˈvit feˈreɾ ˈɛɾn]; Spanish: [daˈβið feˈreɾ ˈeɾn]; born 2 April 1982) is a Spanish former professional tennis player. A three-time Davis Cup champion with Spain, Ferrer won tournaments at all levels on the ATP Tour (ATP 250, ATP 500, Masters 1000) except at a major, and currently has the ninth highest career prize money earnings of all time among male tennis players (not adjusting for inflation). Ferrer also holds the distinction of winning the most matches on the ATP Tour without having won a major. Ferrer turned professional in 2000 and was regarded as a clay-court specialist in his early career, winning 13 of his 27 titles on the surface. However, he has had significant success on all surfaces, having reached the final of the 2013 French Open (without losing a set en route), the semifinals of the Australian and US Opens twice each, and the quarterfinals of Wimbledon twice. Ferrer was part of the Spanish Davis Cup team that won the title in 2008, 2009, and 2011. He won the 2012 Paris Masters, and was runner-up at six other Masters tournaments as well as at the 2007 Tennis Masters Cup. He is widely considered one of the best players not to have won a Grand Slam tournament. He first achieved a top-10 ranking in 2006 and reached a career-high ranking of world No. 3 in July 2013. He retired in 2019, competing for the last time at his home tournament of Madrid.
