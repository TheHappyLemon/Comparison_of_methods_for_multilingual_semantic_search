The 29th Rifle Corps (Lithuanian: 29-asis teritorinis šaulių korpusas) was formed several times in the Soviet Red Army, each formation primarily seeing combat on the Eastern Front during World War II. The first formation of the 29th Rifle Corps was known as the 29th Lithuanian Territorial Rifle Corps, composed of troops of the former Lithuanian army, active from the Soviet Union's annexation of Lithuania in August 1940 until September 1941. A second formation existed from March to April 1943, and a third formation was formed in June 1943. This third formation continued to exist until 1957 when it became the 29th Army Corps,, which disbanded in 1969.
