Short I or Yot/Jot (Й й; italics: Й й or Й й; italics: Й й) (sometimes called i kratkoye, Russian: и краткое, Ukrainian: йот) or I with breve, Russian: и с бреве) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It is made of the Cyrillic letter И with a breve. The short I represents the palatal approximant /j/, like the pronunciation of ⟨y⟩ in yesterday. Depending on the romanization system in use and the Slavic language that is under examination, it can be romanized as ⟨y⟩, ⟨j⟩, ⟨i⟩ or ⟨ĭ⟩.
