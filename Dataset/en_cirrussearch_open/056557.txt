Epididymal hypertension (EH), informally referred to as blue balls for males or blue vulva for females, is a harmless but uncomfortable sensation in the genital regions during a prolonged state of sexual arousal. It usually resolves within hours unless relieved through an orgasm. In females, the discomfort occurs in the erectile tissue and clitoris of the vulva. In males, the phenomenon results in an uncomfortable testicular sensation. It most often describes a temporary fluid congestion in the testicles or vulva, caused by prolonged sexual arousal without orgasm. The term epididymal hypertension is derived from the epididymis, a part of the male reproductive system. Despite lacking an epididymis, the term is also applied to females. Professor Caroline Pukall, who co-wrote the first in-depth study on EH, has suggested using the term throbbing crotch syndrome. The term "blue balls" is thought to have originated in the United States, first appearing in 1916. Though lesser known, the equivalent of this phenomenon in females is informally referred to as "blue vulva", among other names. It is not to be confused with the inability to orgasm or the masturbatory practice of edging.
