In 2021 the municipality was expanded to include the former Dundaga municipality, Mērsrags municipality and Roja municipality. The administrative centre of the municipality is Talsi city. The population in 2022 was 35,194. On 25 January 2023, a traffic sign was erected with the municipality's Livonian name to reflect its Livonian cultural heritage as part of the Livonian language revival process. The sign is notable for being the first Livonian-language traffic sign in Latvia; similar signs are planned to be placed at villages along the Livonian Coast.
