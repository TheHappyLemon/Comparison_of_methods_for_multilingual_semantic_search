A modern language is any human language that is currently in use as a native language. The term is used in language education to distinguish between languages which are used for day-to-day communication (such as French and German) and dead classical languages such as Latin and Classical Chinese, which are studied for their cultural and linguistic value.[citation needed] SIL Ethnologue defines a living language as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language" (see also Language ยง Linguistic diversity).
