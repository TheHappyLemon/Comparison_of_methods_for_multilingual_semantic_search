Radde's warbler (Phylloscopus schwarzi) is a leaf warbler which breeds in Siberia. This warbler is strongly migratory and winters in Southeast Asia. The genus name Phylloscopus is from Ancient Greek phullon, "leaf", and skopos, "seeker" (from skopeo, "to watch"). The specific schwarzi commemorates German astronomer Ludwig Schwarz (1822â€“1894).
