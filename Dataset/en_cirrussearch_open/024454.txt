Maicon Douglas Sisenando (born 26 July 1981), also known as Maicon Douglas (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈmajkõ ˈdowɡlɐs]) or simply Maicon, is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a right-back. Known for his directness, speed, crossing, and ability defensively, he was considered one of the best right backs of his generation. Maicon began his career in his native country with Cruzeiro, after initially playing for Grêmio and Criciúma at youth level. He played 125 times for Cruzeiro between 2000 and 2004, earning one national league title and several other domestic competitions, before moving to Europe when he signed for Ligue 1 side Monaco. After two years in Monaco, he signed for Inter Milan in 2006, where he became an established first team player, going on to win the UEFA Champions League in 2010, four Serie A titles, the FIFA Club World Cup and various domestic competitions. In August 2012, he signed for Manchester City. Maicon failed to secure a regular place in the team, moving back to Italy to play for Roma the following season. He returned to Brazil in 2017, playing for Avaí, childhood club Criciúma and Villa Nova. He retired in 2021 after a brief stint in the Italian Serie D and the Sammarinese league. As a Brazil international, Maicon made his debut in 2003 and represented his nation on 76 occasions, scoring seven goals. He won a runners-up medal at the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and took part in three Copa América tournaments (winning the competition in 2004 and 2007) and two FIFA World Cups (finishing in fourth-place in 2014 on home soil). He was also a member of the teams that won consecutive FIFA Confederations Cup titles in 2005 and 2009.
