The European Olympic Committees (EOC; French: Comités olympiques européens, COE) is an organisation based in Rome, Italy, consisting of 50 National Olympic Committees from the continent of Europe. Among other duties, the EOC organizes three major multi-sport events. These are the European Youth Olympic Festival, the Games of the Small States of Europe and the European Games. The EOC has no connection with another multi-sport event called the European Championships, which are organised by various European discipline-specific sports associations.
