The 2014 NBA All-Star Game was an exhibition basketball game that was played on February 16, 2014, during the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2013–14 season. It was the 63rd edition of the NBA All-Star Game, and was played at Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, home of the New Orleans Pelicans. The Eastern Conference defeated the Western Conference, 163–155. Kyrie Irving was named the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player. The game was televised nationally on TNT in the United States, and TSN in Canada. The Pelicans (the name was changed by new team owner Tom Benson for the 2013–14 season) were awarded the All-Star Game in an announcement by commissioner David Stern on April 16, 2012. It was the second time that New Orleans had hosted the All-Star game; the city had hosted the event in 2008, also at the Smoothie King Center (then known as New Orleans Arena). Starters for the game were selected by the fans, who could select three frontcourt players and two guards for each conference. LeBron James was the leading vote-getter with 1,416,419 votes. Stephen Curry was also voted as a starter in first All-Star selection, after leading all Western Conference guards in the voting, while Kevin Love overtook Dwight Howard for the final frontcourt starting spot for the West.
