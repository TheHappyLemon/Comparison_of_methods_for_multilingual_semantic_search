Fussballclub Zürich, commonly abbreviated to FC Zürich or simply FCZ, is a Swiss professional football club based in Zürich. The club was founded in 1896 and has won the Swiss Super League 13 times and the Swiss Cup ten times.

FC Zürich is the only Swiss team to have reached the semi-finals of the European Cup more than once. This happened in 1964 and 1977, when the competition was played in its original format. FC Zürich co-founder, first captain, and honorary member Joan Gamper, who grew up in Zurich, later moved to Catalonia and founded Barcelona there in 1899. Since the 1960s, FC Zürich plays in all-white, which is one of the city colours, but has been mainly inspired by Real Madrid. The women's club, FC Zürich Frauen, is the most successful in Switzerland, with 22 championship titles and multiple Champions League participations. The FC Zürich women's teams roots originate in the first Swiss women's football club, DFC Zürich. It features a top-flight team playing in the Swiss Women's Super League, the only existing women's U21 team in Switzerland (competing in the top ranks of second tier Nationalliga B), and U19, U17, U15 and U14 teams. The U17, U15 and U14 teams compete in junior leagues against boys teams.
