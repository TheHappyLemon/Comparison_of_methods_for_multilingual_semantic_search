The 2023 IIHF World Championship Division IV was an international ice hockey tournament run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The tournament was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia from 23 to 26 March 2023 after the original hosts, Kuwait, withdrew from hosting the tournament. Four nations participated in the tournament, including Mongolia, who returned to the World Championships after a ten-year absence. Indonesia and the Philippines made their debut in the World Championships. Originally, the Philippines had made its debut, but withdrew before last year's tournament began due to players, coaches and staffs being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Philippines won the tournament and were promoted to Division III B.
