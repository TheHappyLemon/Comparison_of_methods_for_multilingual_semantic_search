The following article concerns the performance of Brazil at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. They played their first home-soil World Cup after 64 years, since the 1950 World Cup, and thus were automatically qualified for the group stage. Brazil qualified as first at their group, winning two matches (Croatia and Cameroon) and drawing one (Mexico). They eventually reached the semi-finals, beating Chile and Colombia. Brazil, however, were then knocked out by the eventual champions Germany in a match known as the Mineirazo. In the third-place match, Brazil lost to Netherlands and therefore ended the tournament in fourth place.
