Milan–San Remo (in Italian Milano-Sanremo), also called "The Spring classic" or "La Classicissima", is an annual road cycling race between Milan and Sanremo, in Northwest Italy. With a distance of 298 km (~185.2 miles) it is the longest professional one-day race in modern cycling. It is the first major classic race of the season, usually held on the third Saturday of March. The first edition was held in 1907. It is traditionally the first of the five Monuments of the season, considered to be one of the most prestigious one-day events in cycling. It was the opening race of the UCI Road World Cup series until the series was replaced by the UCI ProTour in 2005 and the World Tour in 2011. The most successful rider with seven victories is Belgian Eddy Merckx. Italian Costante Girardengo achieved 11 podium finishes in the interwar period, winning the race six times. In modern times, German Erik Zabel and Spaniard Óscar Freire have recorded four and three wins respectively. Milan–San Remo is considered a sprinters classic because of its mainly flat course (although the Poggio climb close to the finish has often been an opportunity for puncheurs and rouleurs), whereas the other Italian Monument race, the Giro di Lombardia, held in autumn, is considered a climbers classic. From 1999 to 2005, a women's race, the Primavera Rosa, was organized alongside the men's but at a shorter distance.
