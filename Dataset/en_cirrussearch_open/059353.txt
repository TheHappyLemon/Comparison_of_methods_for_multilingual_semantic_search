Nicknamed "the Joker", he is regarded as one of the greatest players and centers of all time, and is often considered the greatest draft steal in NBA history. A six-time NBA All-Star, Jokić has been named to the All-NBA Team on five occasions (including three first-team selections), and won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons.

He was voted to the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 2016. In the 2018–19 NBA season, while leading the Nuggets to the Western Conference Semifinals, he received his first All-Star and All-NBA First Team selections. The following season, he once again received All-Star and All-NBA honors, while leading his team to the Western Conference Finals. In the 2022–23 NBA season, he was awarded NBA Finals MVP after leading the Nuggets to their first-ever NBA championship. Jokić ranks among the top 4 on the all-time list of the NBA players with the most triple-doubles (regular season and playoffs), where he is the leading international player and center, and he holds the record for fastest triple-double (achieved in 14 minutes and 33 seconds).
