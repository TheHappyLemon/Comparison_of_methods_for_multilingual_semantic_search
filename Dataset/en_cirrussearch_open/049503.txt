Men in Black: International (stylized as MIB: International in promotional material) is a 2019 American science fiction action comedy film directed by F. Gary Gray and written by the writing team of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway. It is the fourth installment in the Men in Black film series, serving as a stand-alone sequel set in the same universe as the previous films, but is the first film in the series to not feature Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones as the main characters. It stars Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, Kumail Nanjiani, Rebecca Ferguson, Rafe Spall, and Liam Neeson. Emma Thompson reprises her role from the third film, while Tim Blaney returns to voice Frank the Pug from the first two installments. The film follows the Men in Black taking on its biggest threat: a mole in the agency. Talks of a fourth Men in Black film began after the release of Men in Black 3 in 2012. In February 2018, Hemsworth signed on to lead a spin-off, Gray was hired to direct, and Thompson joined the cast the following month. Filming took place in New York City, Morocco, Italy and London from July to October 2018. Danny Elfman, who had scored the previous three installments, returned to compose the reboot with Chris Bacon. Men in Black: International was produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Tencent Pictures, Amblin Entertainment, and Parkes+MacDonald Image Nation, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is loosely based on the Malibu/Marvel comic book series of the same name by Lowell Cunningham, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 14, 2019. Marred by significant production strife between producer Walter F. Parkes and director Gray, the film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the "lackluster action and forgettable plot". The film grossed nearly $254 million worldwide.
