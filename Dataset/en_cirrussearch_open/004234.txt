Nuevo León (English: New León) (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈnweβo leˈon] ) is a state in northeastern Mexico. The state borders the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Zacatecas, and San Luis Potosi, and has an extremely narrow international border with the U.S. state of Texas. With a population of 5.78 million people, it is the seventh-most populous federal entity in Mexico and the fourtheenth most densely populated as of 2020. Nuevo León is the 13th-largest federal entity in Mexico by area, with a total land area of 64,156 square kilometers (24,771 square miles). Monterrey is the most populous city in Nuevo León and the ninth-largest in Mexico while also serving as the state's capitol. Monterrey is part of the Monterrey metropolitan area, the second-largest metropolitan area in the country with an estimated population of 5.3 million people in 2020. About 92% of the state's population lives in the metropolitan area. Prior to European colonization, Nuevo León was home to various nomadic groups, known as chicimecas to the Spaniards. Stemming from Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva's expedition in 1580, the New Kingdom of León was established, encompassing present-day Coahuila, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and Texas, but permament settlement did not occur until 1592. In 1824, Nuevo León became a state of Mexico following the country's successful war for independence. The state began industrializing in the late 19th century and early 20th century, establishing various large companies, which accelerated after the Mexican Revolution. Today, Nuevo León is a major manufacturing hub with one of Mexico's largest economies.
