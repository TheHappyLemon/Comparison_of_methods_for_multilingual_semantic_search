.ke is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Kenya. KENIC, short for Kenya Network Information Centre, is the authoritative agency responsible for managing the registrations and issuance of the .ke domain. In 2002, KENIC assumed control of the .ke domain when it had a meager number of less than 1,000 registrations. Prior to KENIC's involvement, the administration of the domain was overseen by two individuals: Shem Ochuodho from Kenya and Randy Bush from America, both esteemed tech experts.
