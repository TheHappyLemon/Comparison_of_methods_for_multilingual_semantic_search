The Zone of Interest is a 2023 historical drama film written and directed by Jonathan Glazer, co-produced between the United Kingdom, the United States and Poland. Loosely based on the 2014 novel by Martin Amis, the film focuses on the life of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss and his wife Hedwig, who live with their family in a home in the "Zone of Interest" next to the concentration camp. Christian Friedel stars as Rudolf Höss alongside Sandra Hüller as Hedwig Höss. Development of the film began in 2014 around the publication of the Amis novel, which is itself based partially on real events. Glazer opted to tell the story of the Hösses rather than the characters they inspired and conducted extensive research into the family, as he sought to make a film that demystifies the perpetrators of the Holocaust as "mythologically evil". The project was formally announced in 2019, with A24 confirmed to distribute the film. Filming took place primarily around Auschwitz in summer 2021. The Zone of Interest premiered at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on 19 May 2023 and was theatrically released in the United States on 15 December 2023. The film received critical acclaim with praise towards Glazer's direction and script, the minimal use of music, sound design, cinematography, experimental narrative and atmosphere. Among its accolades, The Zone of Interest received five nominations (including Best Picture) at the 96th Academy Awards, winning two for Best International Feature (the first for a non-English British film) and Best Sound. The film also won the Grand Prix at Cannes and three British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film Not in the English Language, received three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, and was named one of the top five international films of 2023 by the National Board of Review.
