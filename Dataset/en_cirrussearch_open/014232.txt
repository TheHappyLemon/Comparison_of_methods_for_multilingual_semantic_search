The 2012 NBA draft was held on June 28, 2012, at Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The draft started at 7:00 pm Eastern Daylight Time (2300 UTC), and was broadcast in the United States on ESPN. In this draft, National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. The New Orleans Hornets, who had a 13.70 percent probability of obtaining the first selection, won the NBA draft lottery on May 30. The Charlotte Bobcats and the Washington Wizards were second and third, respectively. This draft marked the first time that the first two players selected were from the same school (Anthony Davis and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist were teammates at Kentucky). It also set a record of having six players from one school (Kentucky) being selected in the two rounds of the draft and was the first draft to have the first three selections be college freshmen all from the same conference (Southeastern Conference). Bernard James was the oldest player drafted in an NBA draft, being 27 years old at the time of the draft. The draft contained seven players who combined for 10 championships as well as having Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard both named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. Six players have participated in an All-Star Game. Draymond Green won NBA championships with the Golden State Warriors in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022, as well as being named an All-Star in 2016–2018 and 2022. Green was named the Defensive Player of the Year in 2017, while also leading the league in steals that season. Anthony Davis won a championship with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020 and was an All-Star from 2014–2021, and 2024, as well as the NBA All Star Game MVP in 2017. He also was the NBA blocks leader in 2014, 2015, and 2018. Damian Lillard became the fourth player to be unanimously named Rookie of the Year. Lillard was an All-Star in 2014, 2015, 2018–2021, and 2023–2024, the All-Star Game MVP in 2024, as well as the winner of the Three-Point Contest in 2023 and 2024. Khris Middleton won a championship with the Milwaukee Bucks in 2021 and was selected as an All-Star in 2019–2020, and 2022. Of the players drafted, 30 were forwards, 21 were guards, and 9 were centers. The 2012 NBA draft marked the first appearance of the Brooklyn Nets. This draft also marks the last draft appearance for the New Orleans Hornets. After the 2012–13 season, the franchise was renamed as the New Orleans Pelicans. New Orleans made their first draft appearance as the Pelicans in 2013. Four of the players selected in this draft never played in an NBA game throughout their professional basketball careers. Two of those players were the sole selection of the draft by their respective teams: İlkan Karaman (Brooklyn's only pick) and Marcus Denmon (San Antonio's only pick).
