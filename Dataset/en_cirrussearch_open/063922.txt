Troms og Finnmark (Norwegian: [trʊms ɔ ˈfɪ̀nːmɑrk]; Northern Sami: Romsa ja Finnmárku [ˈromːsa ja ˈfinːmaːrku]; Kven: Tromssa ja Finmarkku; Finnish: Tromssa ja Finnmark) was a county in northern Norway that existed from 2020 to 2023. The county was established on 1 January 2020 as the result of a regional reform. It was the largest county by area in Norway, encompassing about 75,000 square kilometres (29,000 sq mi), and was formed by the merger of the former Finnmark and Troms counties in addition to Tjeldsund Municipality from Nordland county. The administrative centre of the county was split between two towns. The political and administrative offices were based in city of Tromsø (the seat of the old Troms county). The county governor was based in town of Vadsø (the seat of the old Finnmark county). The two towns are about 800 kilometres (500 mi) apart, approximately a 10-hour drive by car. On 15 June 2022, a parliamentary decision ruled to demerge the county back to Finnmark and Troms beginning on 1 January 2024, with the Tjeldsund Municipality assigned to Troms county.
