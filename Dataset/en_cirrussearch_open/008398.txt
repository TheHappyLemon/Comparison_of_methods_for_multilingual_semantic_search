Gröna Lund (Swedish pronunciation: [ɡrøːnaˈlɵnːd]; lit. "Green Grove"), or colloquially Grönan (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈɡrø̂ːnan]), is an amusement park in Stockholm, Sweden. Located on the seaward side of Djurgården Island, it is relatively small compared to other amusement parks, mainly because of its central location, which limits expansion. The 3.8 ha (9.4 acres) amusement park has over 30 attractions and is a popular venue for concerts in the summer. It was founded in 1883 by James Schultheiss.
