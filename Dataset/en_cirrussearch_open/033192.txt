Primož Roglič (Slovene pronunciation: [ˈpriːmɔʃ ˈɾoːglìːtʃ] ; born 29 October 1989) is a Slovenian professional racing cyclist who rides for UCI WorldTeam Bora–Hansgrohe. He started as a ski jumper and switched to cycling several years after an accident suffered at Planica. At the 2017 Tour de France, Roglič became the first Slovenian to win a stage. In September 2019, he won the Vuelta a España general classification, becoming the first Slovenian to win a Grand Tour competition. He has also finished on the final podium at the 2019 Giro d'Italia (third overall), and at the 2020 Tour de France (second overall), being the first Slovenian to wear the yellow jersey, before losing out to compatriot Tadej Pogačar. He won the 2020 Vuelta a España, defending his title from 2019. In 2021, he won an Olympic gold medal in the men's individual time trial. He then went on to win his third Vuelta in a row, becoming the third rider to do so. In 2023, he won the 106th edition of the Giro d'Italia, the first Slovenian rider to win a Giro. Between 2019 and 2021, Roglič spent a 75 weeks (former record) as the No. 1 ranked cyclist in the UCI Men's road racing world ranking, and has twice finished as the year-end No. 1.
