Inappropriate Comedy (stylized as inAPPropriate Comedy) is a 2013 American satirical sketch comedy film directed by Vince Offer. It stars Ari Shaffir (who also co-wrote), Rob Schneider, Michelle Rodriguez, Adrien Brody and Lindsay Lohan, and was released on March 22, 2013. The film was originally envisioned as a sequel to Offer's previous anthology, The Underground Comedy Movie, and called Underground Comedy 2010. Trailers for Underground Comedy 2010 were released to TV and the internet before the film being billed as Inappropriate Comedy. It is also a partial remake of Offer's previous film, recycling the sketches "Flirty Harry" and "Sushi Mama". The film was a critical and commercial failure, with some critics comparing it to the (itself critically panned) Movie 43.
