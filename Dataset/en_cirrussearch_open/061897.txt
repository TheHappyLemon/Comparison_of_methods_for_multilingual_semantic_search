Bruno Conti (Italian pronunciation: [ˈbruːno ˈkonti]; born 13 March 1955) is an Italian football manager and former player. He is currently head of AS Roma's youth sector. Throughout his playing career, Conti was usually deployed as a winger, and also previously played for Roma, where he spent his entire club career, aside from two season-long loan spells with Genoa in the 1970s. He is considered by many in the sport to be one of the greatest Italian players of all time in his position. Nicknamed "The Mayor of Rome", Conti was an important figure in the club's history, and won a league title as well as five Coppa Italia titles during his time in the Italian capital. At international level, he was notably a member of Italy's 1982 FIFA World Cup winning team, and also took part at the 1986 FIFA World Cup.
