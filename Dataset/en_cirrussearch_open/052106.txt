The 2020 Paris–Nice was a road cycling stage race that was held between 8 and 14 March 2020 in France. It was the 78th edition of Paris–Nice and the fifth race of the 2020 UCI World Tour. The race was shortened on 13 March, removing the final stage, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. The global health situation had already led to the withdrawal of several teams before and during the race. German rider Maximilian Schachmann won the overall classification after the race was ended following the seventh stage. Belgian Tiesj Benoot was second, Colombian Sergio Higuita third.
