The Black Phone is a 2021 American supernatural horror film directed by Scott Derrickson and written by Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill, who both produced with Jason Blum. It is an adaptation of the 2004 short story of the same name by Joe Hill. The film stars Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, James Ransone, and Ethan Hawke. In the film, an abducted teenager (Finney Blake played by Mason Thames) uses a mysterious black rotary dial phone to communicate with the previous victims of his deranged captor (The Grabber played by Ethan Hawke) in order to escape. Derrickson went to direct The Black Phone after departing from Marvel Studios' Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness over creative differences. Filming occurred over two months in Wilmington and surrounding counties in the state of North Carolina. The Black Phone premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 25, 2021, and was theatrically released by Universal Pictures on June 24, 2022. A box office hit, the film grossed $161 million worldwide and generally received positive reviews. A sequel is in development and set for release on June 27, 2025.
