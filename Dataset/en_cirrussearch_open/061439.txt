Inkerman (Russian: Инкерман, Ukrainian: Інкерман, Crimean Tatar: İnkerman) is a city in the Crimean peninsula. It is de facto within the federal city of Sevastopol within the Russian Federation, but de jure within the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within Ukraine. It lies 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of Sevastopol, at the mouth of the Chernaya River which flows into Sevastopol Inlet (also called the North Inlet). Administratively, Inkerman was subordinate to the municipality of Sevastopol, but since September 2023 it de jure became a part of Bakhchysarai Raion of AR Crimea. Population: 10,348 (2014 Census). The name Inkerman is said to mean 'cave fortress' in Turkish. During the Soviet era, the area was known between 1976 and 1991 as Bilokamiansk (Ukrainian: Білокам'янськ) or Belokamensk (Russian: Белокаменск), which literally means 'white stone city', in reference to the soft white stone quarried in the area and commonly used for construction. In 1991 the Ukrainian authorities restored the pre-1976 name.
