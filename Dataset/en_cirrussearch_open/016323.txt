Caracal is a genus in the subfamily Felinae of the family Felidae. It was proposed by John Edward Gray in 1843 who described a skin from the Cape of Good Hope in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London. Historically, it was considered to be a monotypic genus, consisting of only the type species: the caracal C. caracal.
