The men's individual time trial event at the UCI Road World Championships is the men's world championship for the road bicycle racing discipline of time trial. Introduced in 1994 by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the world's governing body of cycling, the event consists of a time trial covering a distance of approximately 45 kilometres (28Â mi) over flat or rolling terrain. Riders start separated by two-minute intervals; the one that completes the course in the shortest time is the winner, and is entitled to wear the rainbow jersey in time trial events for the forthcoming season. Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara (2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010) and Germany's Tony Martin (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2016) have won the most competitions, with four each. Australia's Michael Rogers (2003, 2004 and 2005) is next by number of victories, with three wins; Martin and Rogers are the only people to have taken three wins in successive years. Bradley Wiggins is the oldest winner of the event, at 34 years and 149 days old when he won in 2014, while Remco Evenepoel is the youngest winner, at 23 years and 198 days old when he won in 2023.

Cancellara has the most third-place finishes, with three. German cyclists are the most successful, with seven victories, while Swiss and Australian cyclists are second with five each.
