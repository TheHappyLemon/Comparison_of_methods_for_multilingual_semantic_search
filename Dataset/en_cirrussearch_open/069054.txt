Central Visayas (Cebuano: Tunga-tungang Kabisay-an; Tagalog: Gitnang Kabisayaan or Gitnang Visayas) is an administrative region in the Philippines, numerically designated as Region VII. It consists of four provinces: Cebu, Bohol, Negros Oriental, and Siquijor. The region also has three highly urbanized cities: Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu, and Mandaue. The regional center and largest city is Cebu City. The Cebuano language is the region's lingua franca. The region is also dominated by the native speakers of four Visayan languages: Bantayanon, Boholano, Hiligaynon, and Porohanon. With a population of 8,081,988 inhabitants, it is the most populous region in the Visayas. In 2015, Central Visayas was redefined when it lost the province of Negros Oriental to the newly formed Negros Island Region. However, the Negros Island Region was dissolved in 2017, returning Negros Oriental to Central Visayas.
