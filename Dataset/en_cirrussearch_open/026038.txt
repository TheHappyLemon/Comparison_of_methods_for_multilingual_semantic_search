Latvia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 with the song "Love Injected" written and performed by Aminata. The Latvian broadcaster Latvijas TelevÄ«zija (LTV) organised the national final Supernova 2015 in order to select the Latvian entry for the 2015 contest in Vienna, Austria. Twenty songs were selected to compete in the national final, which consisted of four shows: two heats, one semi-final and a final. In the heats and the semi-final, four entries were selected to advance from each show: two entries selected based on a public televote and two entries selected by a four-member jury panel. Four songs ultimately qualified to compete in the final on 22 February 2015 where a public vote exclusively selected "Love Injected" performed by Aminata as the winner. Latvia was drawn to compete in the second semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 21 May 2015. Performing during the show in position 10, "Love Injected" was announced among the top 10 entries of the second semi-final and therefore qualified to compete in the final on 23 May. It was later revealed that Latvia placed second out of the 17 participating countries in the semi-final with 155 points. In the final, Latvia performed in position 19 and placed sixth out of the 27 participating countries, scoring 186 points. This was Latvia's best placing in the contest since 2005.
