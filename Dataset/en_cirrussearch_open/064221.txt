Abai Region (Kazakh: Абай облысы, romanized: Abai oblysy, [ɑbɑj ɔbɫəsɯ], Russian: Абайская область, romanized: Abayskaya oblast) is a region of Kazakhstan. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced on 16 March 2022 that the region would be created. The area split off from East Kazakhstan Region when Tokayev's bill came into force on 8 June 2022. The administrative center of the region is Semey, until 2007 known as Semipalatinsk. Its borders roughly correspond to the old Semipalatinsk Region which was liquidated in 1997 and merged with East Kazakhstan Region.
