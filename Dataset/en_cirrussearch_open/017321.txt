The Nokia 2630, released in Q2 2007, is a mobile phone developed by Nokia. The 2630 is a basic but decent and feature-packed phone containing all the features of its predecessor Nokia 2610, including a VGA camera and improved design and display. It was notable for being the thinnest Nokia phone at the time, less than one centimetre thick, and with tiny dimensions overall and a very low weight of 66 grams. It was manufactured at Nokia factories in Romania and China.
