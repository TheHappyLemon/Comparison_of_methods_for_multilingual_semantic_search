Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation is a 2015 American action spy film written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie from a story by McQuarrie and Drew Pearce. It is the sequel to Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011) and the fifth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. It stars Tom Cruise in the main role, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris and Alec Baldwin. It follows Impossible Missions Force agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team, who, subsequent to their disbandment and Hunt's pursuit by the Central Intelligence Agency, must surreptitiously fight The Syndicate, an international black ops terrorist group of rogue government agents from around the world. McQuarrie, who completed uncredited rewrites for Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, was announced as the director of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation in August 2013. The returns of Cruise, Renner, Pegg and Rhames were confirmed by July 2014 while the screenplay was also developed by Pearce and Will Staples; it was ultimately solely credited to McQuarrie, with Pearce receiving story credit. Ferguson, Harris and Baldwin rounded out the cast that October. Principal photography was from August 2014 to March 2015, in locations including Vienna, Casablanca, London, and at Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire. The film's official title was revealed in March 2015. Originally scheduled for worldwide release on December 25, 2015, it premiered at the Vienna State Opera (one of its filming locations) on July 23, 2015, and was theatrically released in the US by Paramount Pictures a week later. It received widespread critical acclaim, with praise for its action sequences, performances (particularly those of Cruise and Ferguson), screenwriting, and direction. It grossed $683 million worldwide, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the then-second-highest grossing film in the franchise. A sequel, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, was released in July 2018.
