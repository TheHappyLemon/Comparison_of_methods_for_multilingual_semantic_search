The Japan National Stadium, officially the National Stadium (国立競技場, Kokuritsu Kyōgijō), alternatively “Olympic Stadium” (オリンピックスタジアム, Orinpikku Sutajiamu, during 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics), and formerly “New National Stadium” (新国立競技場, Shin Kokuritsu Kyōgijō) is a multi-purpose stadium used mostly for association football in Kasumigaoka, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan. The facility served as the main stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the venue for track and field athletics events at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics in 2021. Demolition of the old National Stadium was completed in May 2015, allowing for the construction of the new stadium to begin on 11 December 2016. The original plans for the new stadium were scrapped in July 2015 by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, who announced a rebid after a public outcry prompted by increased building costs. As a result, the new design was not ready for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, as originally intended. A new design created by architect Kengo Kuma was chosen in December 2015 to replace the original design, which was completed on 30 November 2019.
