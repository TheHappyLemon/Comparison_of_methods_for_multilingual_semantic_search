The "axis of evil" is a name given to the apparent correlation between the plane of the Solar System and aspects of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It gives the plane of the Solar System and hence the location of Earth a greater significance than might be expected by chance â€“ a result which has been claimed to be evidence of a departure from the Copernican principle as assumed in the concordance model.
