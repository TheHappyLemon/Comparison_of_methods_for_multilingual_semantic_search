Anthony Beauvillier (born June 8, 1997) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL). Growing up in Quebec, Beauvillier played for the Shawinigan Cataractes of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for three seasons. Following an outstanding 2014–15 season, he was selected to play in the 2015 CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game and named to the 2014–15 QMJHL Second All-Star Team. He was eventually drafted by the New York Islanders with the 28th overall pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. After Beauvillier and the Cataractes fell to the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies in Game 5 of the 2016 President's Cup Final, Beauvillier turned professional with the Islanders organization. He played for the Islanders until January 2023 when he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks, and was then traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in December 2023. Beauvillier would again be traded in March 2024 to the Predators.
