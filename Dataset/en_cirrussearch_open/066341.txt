Prospekt (Russian: проспе́кт, IPA: [prɐˈspʲekt] ) is a Slavic term describing a broad, multi-lane and very long straight street in urban areas, which serves as an arterial road. The use of "prospekt" as a road-related concept originated in the Russian Empire. As an urban area sprawls along transportation routes, the roads outside of city limits called chaussee (French for road surface) often also become converted into prospekts.
