Daisies (Czech: Sedmikrásky) is a 1966 Czechoslovakian surrealist psychological comedy-drama film written and directed by Věra Chytilová. Regarded as a milestone of the Czechoslovak New Wave movement, it follows two young women (Jitka Cerhová and Ivana Karbanová), both named Marie, who engage in strange pranks. Originally planned as a satire of bourgeois decadence, the movie targets those attached to rules and was referred to by Chytilová as "a necrologue about a negative way of life." Daisies also inverts the stereotypical ideas of women and redraws them to the heroines' advantage. The film is considered critical of authoritarianism, Soviet communism and patriarchy, and it was banned from theaters or export in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.
