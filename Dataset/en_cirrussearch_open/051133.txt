IFUSCO (International Finno-Ugric Students' Conference) is an annual international conference for and by the students of Finno-Ugric languages and peoples. IFUSCO conference contains presentations and workshops on linguistics, ethnography, folkloristics, archaeology, history, museology, literature, translation theory, sociology, law, music, mythology, regional issues, education, economics etc., that are connected to the lives of speakers of Finno-Ugric languages. In addition, IFUSCO offers different events related to the Finno-Ugric cultures and the host country. IFUSCO has always been a multilingual conference, featuring the Uralic languages as well as English, Russian and German. One of IFUSCO's long-standing traditions is the three-language rule, according to which every presentation must consist of three languages – one for the abstract of the presentation, one for its handouts or slides, and one for the speech itself. Every hosting students’ committee is also presenting a unique emblem of the year's event that serves as a logo for the whole conference.
