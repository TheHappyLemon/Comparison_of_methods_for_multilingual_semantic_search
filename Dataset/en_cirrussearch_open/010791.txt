The Art Ross Trophy is awarded to the National Hockey League (NHL) player who leads the league in points at the end of the regular season. It was presented to the league by former player, general manager, and head coach Art Ross. The trophy has been awarded 70 times to 29 players since its introduction in the 1947â€“48 NHL season. Ross is also known for his design of the official NHL puck, with slightly bevelled edges for better control. The current holder, for the third consecutive season, is Connor McDavid of the Edmonton Oilers.
