Royal Excel Mouscron (French pronunciation: [mukʁɔ̃], Dutch pronunciation: [muˈskrun]), commonly known as Mouscron or familiarly as REM, was a Belgian professional football club based in Mouscron. The team was formed as Royal Mouscron-Péruwelz in the spring of 2010 as a result of the merging between bankrupt R.E. Mouscron and R.R.C. Peruwelz. It won promotion to the Belgian Pro League in 2014 and changed its name in the summer of 2016, being relegated in 2021 and filing for bankruptcy a year later. The club was owned by nearby French club Lille OSC from 2012 to 2015, and by a Maltese consortium linked to Israeli agent Pini Zahavi from 2015 to 2018, Pairoj Piempongsant of Carabao Energy Drink from 2018 to 2020, and Spanish-Luxembourgish businessman Gérard López from 2020 to 2022. The club was investigated by the Belgian federal judiciary over alleged financial offences relating to Zahavi.
