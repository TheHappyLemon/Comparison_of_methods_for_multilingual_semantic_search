Sheffield Football Club is an English football club from Dronfield, North Derbyshire. They currently compete in the Northern Premier League Division One East. Founded in October 1857, the club is recognised by FIFA as the oldest existing club still playing football in the world. Sheffield F.C. initially played games under the Sheffield Rules and did not officially adopt the new FA rules until 1878. The club competes in the Rules derby with near neighbours Hallam. In 2004 they were given the FIFA Order of Merit, an award given to only one other club; Real Madrid. In 2007 they were inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame, to commemorate their 150th anniversary. On the pitch, the club's finest hour came in 1904 when they won the FA Amateur Cup, a competition conceived after a suggestion by Sheffield. They also finished as runners up of the FA Vase in 1977.
