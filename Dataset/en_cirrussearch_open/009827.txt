The Namejs ring (Latvian: Nameja gredzens) is a traditional Latvian ring which represents Latvian independence, friendship, and trust, and symbolizes the unity of three ancient Latvian lands – Kurzeme, Latgale, and Vidzeme. The design and customs associated with it originated in ancient Latgalian lands, which is the easternmost of the four historical regions of Latvia. The ring, as currently known, was first produced in the 12th century. The Namejs ring is a common symbol in Latvian culture. In 1928, Aleksandrs Grīns wrote a novel titled “Nameja gredzens” (“Ring of Namejs”), which popularized the ring and its symbolism. In 2018, Aigars Grauba produced a film called The Pagan King (Latvian: Nameja gredzens), which depicts an alternate version of the ring's legend.
