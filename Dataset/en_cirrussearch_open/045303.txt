The Russo-Turkish War of 1686–1700 was part of the joint European effort to confront the Ottoman Empire. The larger European conflict was known as the Great Turkish War. The Russo-Turkish War began after the Tsardom of Russia joined the European anti-Turkish coalition (Habsburg monarchy, Poland–Lithuania, Venice) in 1686, after Poland-Lithuania agreed to recognize Russian incorporation of Kiev and the left bank of Ukraine.
