The 1932 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the X Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event held in Los Angeles, California, United States, from July 30 to August 14. The 1932 Games had 1,332 athletes from 37 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participating in a total of 116 events in 14 sports. Athletes from 27 NOCs won medals, of which 19 won at least one gold medal. The 1932 Games featured the first appearance of NOCs from Colombia and the Republic of China. The most successful NOC at the Games was that representing the host nation, the United States. They won the most gold and total medals, 41 and 103, respectively. The second place NOC, representing Italy, improved significantly compared to the previous Games, winning 36 medals, almost twice as much as in 1928. The Indian Men's Field Hockey team defended their gold medal from the previous Games, a feat they repeated until the 1956 Summer Olympics.
