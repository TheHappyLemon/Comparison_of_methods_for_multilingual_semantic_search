Wu Ching-kuo (Chinese: 吳經國; pinyin: Wú Jīngguó; born October 18, 1946) was the president of the International Boxing Association (AIBA), a post he held from 2006 to 2017. He resigned from his position in November 2017. Having been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 1988 (and thus representing the IOC in Taiwan, participating as Chinese Taipei), he was elected to its executive board in 2012. After serious allegations of financial mismanagement and accounting irregularities were made against Wu, a motion was passed against him by AIBA's executive committee at a meeting in Moscow in July 2017. Members of AIBA's governing body called for an Extraordinary Congress within 3 months to table a no-confidence motion against the AIBA president. It set up an Interim Management Committee to prevent Wu from having any further financial control over AIBA. Wu claimed that this was "political maneuvering" and refused to step down. However, with the boxing world in uproar over the financial mismanagement under Wu's watch, he had no option but to resign in November 2017.
