Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island (Russian: Большой Ляховский остров), or Great Lyakhovsky, is the largest of the Lyakhovsky Islands belonging to the New Siberian Islands archipelago between the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea in northern Russia. It has an area of 5,156.6 km2 (1,991.0 sq mi), and a maximum altitude of 311 m (1,020 ft) (Emy Tas). The peninsula projecting towards the west of the island is the Kigilyakh Peninsula (Poluostrov Kigilyakh). Off Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island's southwestern cape lies a small islet called Ostrov Khopto-Terer. The Lyakhovsky Islands are named in honour of Ivan Lyakhov, who explored them in 1773. In 2020, a well preserved ice age cave bear was found on the island.
