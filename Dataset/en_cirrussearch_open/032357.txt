The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Burkina Faso accepted the convention on April 2, 1987, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Burkina Faso has three World Heritage Sites, one of them shared with neighbouring countries of Benin and Niger.
