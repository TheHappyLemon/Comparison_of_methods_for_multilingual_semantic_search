Pseudoboletus parasiticus, previously known as Boletus parasiticus and Xerocomus parasiticus, and commonly known as the parasitic bolete, is a rare Boletaceae mushroom found on earthballs (Scleroderma citrinum). Pseudoboletus parasiticus is one of the earliest-diverging lineages of the Boletaceae, after the clade comprising Chalciporus and Buchwaldoboletus.
