Expedition 39 was the 39th expedition to the International Space Station. It marked the first time the ISS had been under command of a Japanese astronaut, space veteran Koichi Wakata. After Expedition 21 in 2009 and Expedition 35 in 2013, it was only the third time an ISS crew was led by neither a NASA nor an RSA crew member. During Expedition 39, Astronauts Mastracchio and Swanson installed the "Veggie" project on the International Space Station.
