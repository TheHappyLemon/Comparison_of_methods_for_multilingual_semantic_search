Jill Ellen Stein (born May 14, 1950) is an American physician, activist, and political candidate. She was the Green Party's nominee for president of the United States in the 2012 and 2016 elections and the Green-Rainbow Party's candidate for governor of Massachusetts in 2002 and 2010. Her campaigns for president have focused heavily on the proposal of a Green New Deal, which includes a number of reforms to address climate change and income inequality, as well as civil and political rights reform. In 2012, Stein received 469,015 votes, which accounted for .36% of the popular vote; in 2016, she received 1.45 million votes or 1.07% of the popular vote. In 2023, it was announced that Stein would help run Cornel West's 2024 Green Party campaign for president. After West withdrew from the Green Party to continue his campaign as an independent, Stein launched her campaign for the Green Party's 2024 presidential nomination.
