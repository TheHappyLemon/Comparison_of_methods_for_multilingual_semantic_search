The 2017 UEFA European Women's Championship, commonly referred to as UEFA Women's Euro 2017, was the 12th edition of the UEFA Women's Championship, the quadrennial international football championship organised by UEFA for the women's national teams of Europe. The competition was expanded to 16 teams (from 12 teams in the previous edition). The Netherlands was chosen to host the tournament by the UEFA Executive Committee on 4 December 2014. Germany's 22-year reign as champions of Europe was ended after losing 1–2 to Denmark in the quarter-finals. It was only Germany's second loss in the tournament since 1993. Another former winner, Norway, lost to both finalists, the Netherlands and Denmark, and ended without goals or points. The Netherlands won their first ever title since the men's UEFA Euro 1988 by beating fellow first time finalists Denmark 4–2 in the final. Austria, Belgium, Portugal, Scotland and Switzerland made their debuts for the first time.
