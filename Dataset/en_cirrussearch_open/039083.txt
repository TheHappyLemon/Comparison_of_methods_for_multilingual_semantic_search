Estadio Centenario is a stadium in the Parque Batlle of Montevideo, Uruguay, used primarily for staging football matches. It is owned by the Montevideo Department. The stadium was built between 1929 and 1930 to host the inaugural 1930 FIFA World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centenary of Uruguay's first constitution. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums. On July 18, 1983, it was declared by FIFA as the first Historical Monument of World Football, to this day the only building to achieve this recognition worldwide. Estadio Centenario is the national stadium of Uruguay and the primary home of their national football team. Uruguay has always been a threat when playing in their home stadium, consistently beating top teams. Even the top-ranked Brazil national football team has only managed three wins in 20 attempts; two were official matches during 2010 and 2018 World Cup qualification, but one was Uruguay's heaviest defeat at the stadium when they lost 4â€“0 to Brazil in 2009.
