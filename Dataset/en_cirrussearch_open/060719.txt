The Los Angeles Angels are an American professional baseball team based in Anaheim, California. The Angels compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West Division. Since 1966, the team has played its home games at Angel Stadium. The franchise was founded in Los Angeles in 1961 by Gene Autry as one of MLB's first two expansion teams and the first to originate in California. Deriving its name from an earlier Los Angeles Angels franchise that played in the Pacific Coast League (PCL), the team was based in Los Angeles until moving to Anaheim in 1966. Due to the move, the franchise was known as the California Angels from 1965 to 1996 and the Anaheim Angels from 1997 to 2004. "Los Angeles" was added back to the name in 2005, but because of a lease agreement with Anaheim that required the city to also be in the name, the franchise was known as the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim until 2015. The current Los Angeles Angels name came into use the following season. The Angels won the World Series in 2002, their first and only championship appearance to date. They, along with the Washington Nationals, are the two MLB franchises to win their sole appearance in the World Series. This was followed by an era in which the Angels made six playoff berths within a decade and saw an increase in fan attendance, consistently placing the franchise among the top draws in MLB. The Angels had accumulated national attention since 2012 with the emergence of three-time AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Mike Trout and an international following since 2018 with the signing of Japanese two-way player and two-time AL MVP Shohei Ohtani, who left the team as a free agent following the 2023 season. Through 2023, the Angels have a win–loss record of 4,958–5,016–3 (.497).
