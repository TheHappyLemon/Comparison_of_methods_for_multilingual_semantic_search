He also starred in notable films such as Quo Vadis (1951), The Sundowners (1960), Billy Budd (1962), and Hot Millions (1968). He portrayed Hercule Poirot in Death on the Nile (1978). He voiced Prince John and King Richard in the Walt Disney Animated film Robin Hood (1973).

Miklós Rózsa, composer of the music for Quo Vadis and of numerous concert works, dedicated his String Quartet No. 1, Op. 22 (1950) to Ustinov. An intellectual and diplomat, he held various academic posts, and served as a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF and president of the World Federalist Movement (WFM).
