Fraternitas Lataviensis is a student organization, known as a Corporation, which differs from American fraternities. Its goals as formulated in 1939: “To gather under our flag students from the University of Latvia, to raise in tradition and garner national and cultural unity as good citizens and public figures, to consciously hone responsibility within community, honour the mind, togetherness and friendship and tactful social values, to encourage towards knowledge and art, as well as Sporting activities encouraging members' physical development.” To this day the Corporations goals and principles have survived: “To gather University of Latvia and other Higher education students of Latvian origin, to educate them in good faith, in the nobility of spirit, and in the national spirit and later in life to unite in friendship.”
