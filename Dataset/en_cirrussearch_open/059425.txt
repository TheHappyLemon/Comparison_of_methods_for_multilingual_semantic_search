Split tunneling is a computer networking concept which allows a user to access dissimilar security domains like a public network (e.g., the Internet) and a local area network or wide area network at the same time, using the same or different network connections. This connection state is usually facilitated through the simultaneous use of a LAN network interface controller (NIC), radio NIC, Wireless LAN (WLAN) NIC, and VPN client software application without the benefit of an access control. For example, suppose a user utilizes a remote access VPN software client connecting to a campus network using a hotel wireless network. The user with split tunneling enabled is able to connect to file servers, database servers, mail servers and other servers on the corporate network through the VPN connection. When the user connects to Internet resources (websites, FTP sites, etc.), the connection request goes directly out the gateway provided by the hotel network. However, not every VPN allows split tunneling. Some VPNs with split tunneling include Private Internet Access (PIA), ExpressVPN, and Surfshark. Split tunneling is sometimes categorized based on how it is configured. A split tunnel configured to only tunnel traffic destined to a specific set of destinations is called a split-include tunnel. When configured to accept all traffic except traffic destined to a specific set of destinations, it is called a split-exclude tunnel.
