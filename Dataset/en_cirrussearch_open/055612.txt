Travis Konecny (/koʊˈnɛkniː/ koh-NEK-nee; born March 11, 1997) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward and alternate captain for the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Flyers selected him in the first round, 24th overall, of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Born in London, Ontario, and raised in Clachan, Konecny grew up watching hockey on television while practicing on frozen ponds. His minor ice hockey career began with the local Chatham-Kent Cyclones, but he soon moved closer to London in order to attend the PEAC hockey academy and play for the Elgin-Middlesex Chiefs of the Alliance Hockey organization. His 114-point season in 2012–13 caught the eye of the Ottawa 67's of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), who selected Konecny first overall in the 2013 OHL draft. Konecny played two and a half seasons of junior ice hockey for Ottawa before he was traded to the Sarnia Sting at the start of 2016 in exchange for two players and eight OHL draft picks. During his junior hockey tenure, Konecny also represented Canada at a number of international tournaments, including the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament and the World Juniors. Just prior to the 2016–17 NHL season, the Flyers announced that both Konecny and his fellow 2015 first-round draftee Ivan Provorov would bypass the traditional tryout period for rookies and would play in the NHL for the entire season. Konecny's first two seasons in the NHL were uneven, with both scoring streak and slumps, and coach Dave Hakstol would frequently move his skaters up and down offensive lines. After Hakstol's firing in December 2018, Konecny found a steady position with Claude Giroux and James van Riemsdyk, and his scoring became consistent. He led the Flyers in scoring for the 2019–20 season, but ran into offensive difficulties after the interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, first with a goal drought in the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs followed by a lackluster performance in the 2020–21 NHL season.
