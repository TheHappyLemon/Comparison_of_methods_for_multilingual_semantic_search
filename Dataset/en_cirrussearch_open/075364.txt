Capri (later Mercury Capri) is a nameplate marketed by the Lincoln-Mercury division of Ford Motor Company over three generations between 1970 and 1994. From 1970 to 1978, the Capri was a sport compact marketed in North America by the Lincoln-Mercury division without any Ford or Mercury divisional branding; it was a captive import, manufactured by Ford of Europe and sold simply as the Capri. From 1979 to 1986, the second generation Capri became part of the Mercury model line as a U.S. built pony car. From 1991 to 1994, the third generation Mercury Capri was a roadster manufactured by Ford Australia and marketed outside North America as the Ford Capri. In North America, the first and third generations of the Capri were marketed without a direct Ford-brand counterpart but were sold in other markets under the Ford brand.
