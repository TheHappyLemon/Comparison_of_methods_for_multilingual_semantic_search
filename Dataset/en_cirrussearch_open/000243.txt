"Scream" is a song by American producer and rapper Timbaland, released as the fifth and final single from his second studio album Shock Value (2007). The song features vocals from American singer and songwriter Keri Hilson and the lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls at the time Nicole Scherzinger. Mosley and Hilson co-wrote the song with American producer Danja, who co-produced the song with Timbaland. Mosley Music Group, in association with Blackground Records and Interscope Records, serviced the song to mainstream radios in the United States in December 2007. "Scream" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with a majority of them praising Hilson's vocal performance, while one reviewer deemed Timbaland's vocals as creepy. The song charted moderately, possibly due in part to the continuing success of Timbaland's previous single "Apologize". It peaked within the top ten in countries like New Zealand and Sweden and in the top fifteen tier in countries like Australia and Ireland. Despite being released first in the United States, the song did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100, being his only single in the United States from Shock Value not to do so. The accompanying music video portrays Timbaland being caressed by two other women while Hilson and Scherzinger are in separate scenes performing seductive movements in isolated areas.
