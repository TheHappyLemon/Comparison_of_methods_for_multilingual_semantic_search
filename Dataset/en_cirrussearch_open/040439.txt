The Cypriot First Division (Greek: Πρωτάθλημα Α΄ Κατηγορίας), known as the Cyta Championship for sponsorship reasons, is the top tier football league competition in Cyprus, run by the Cyprus Football Association. The league is contested by 14 teams and runs from August to May, with the three lowest-placed teams being relegated to the Cypriot Second Division, and replaced by the top three teams in that division.
