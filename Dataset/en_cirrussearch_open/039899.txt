A Babson task (or simply Babson) is a directmate chess problem with the following properties: White has only one key, or first move, that forces checkmate in the stipulated number of moves. Black's defences include the promotion of a certain pawn to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. (Black may have other defences as well.) If Black promotes, then the only way for White towards a forced checkmate in the stipulated number of moves is to promote a pawn to the same piece to which Black promoted. Joseph Ney BabsonÂ [it], the task's eponym, first conceived of the task in 1884. To devise a satisfying Babson task is regarded as one of the greatest challenges in chess composing. For almost a century, it was unknown whether such a task could exist. The Babson task is a special form of Allumwandlung, a chess problem in which the solution contains promotions to each of the four possible pieces. Such problems were already known when Babson formulated his task. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
