Cruel Intentions 2 (also known as Cruel Intentions 2: Manchester Prep or simply as Manchester Prep) is a 2000 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Roger Kumble, starring Robin Dunne, Sarah Thompson, Keri Lynn Pratt, and Amy Adams. It is a prequel to Cruel Intentions (1999) and was released direct-to-video on March 13, 2001. Both films are based on Les Liaisons dangereuses by Choderlos de Laclos. Originally planned as a television series called Manchester Prep, a re-imagined prequel series to the first film, it was picked up by Fox, but was cancelled prior to broadcast in September 1999. Due to the cancellation, the two completed episodes were edited together into a film retitled Cruel Intentions 2, and sexual content scenes involving nudity were added for the DVD release. This film is about how Sebastian Valmont and Kathryn Merteuil met and how they started their reign of terror. The film would be followed by a sequel, Cruel Intentions 3.
