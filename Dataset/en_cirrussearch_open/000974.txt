Rennick Glacier (70°30′S 160°45′E﻿ / ﻿70.500°S 160.750°E﻿ / -70.500; 160.750) is broad glacier, nearly 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) long, which is one of the largest in Antarctica. It rises on the polar plateau westward of Mesa Range and is 20 to 30 nautical miles (37 to 56 km; 23 to 35 mi) wide, narrowing to 10 nautical miles (19 km; 12 mi) near the coast. It takes its name from Rennick Bay where the glacier reaches the sea.
