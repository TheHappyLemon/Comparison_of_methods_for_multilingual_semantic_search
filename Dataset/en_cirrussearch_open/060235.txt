The women's competition in skeleton at the 2022 Winter Olympics will be held on 11 February (runs 1 and 2) and 12 February (runs 3 and 4), at the Xiaohaituo Bobsleigh and Luge Track in Yanqing District of Beijing. Hannah Neise of Germany became the Olympic champion. Jaclyn Narracott of Australia won silver, and Kimberley Bos of the Netherlands bronze. For all of them these were their first Olympic medals, moreover, Narracott's and Bos's medals were the first Olympic medals in skeleton for Australia and the Netherlands. Bos's bronze was the first medal for Netherlands in an ice sport that doesn't involve any type of skating. Great Britain failed to medal in skeleton for the first time ever. Because Christopher Grotheer won gold in the men's skeleton, Niese's gold meant that Germany swept the golds in Skeleton at these Olympics. This was also first time in history of women's skeleton at the Olympics that no British athlete won a medal. A British woman had previously won a medal at every women's skeleton Olympic competition since it was introduced in 2002.
