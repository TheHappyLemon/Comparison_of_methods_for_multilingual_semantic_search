San Juanico Strait (Waray: Sulang han San Juanico) is a narrow strait in the Eastern Visayan region in the Philippines. It separates the islands of Samar and Leyte and connects Carigara Bay (Samar Sea) with the San Pedro Bay (Leyte Gulf). It is about 38 kilometres (24 mi) long.[citation needed] At its narrowest point, the strait is only 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) wide. The strait is crossed by the San Juanico Bridge. The HVDC Leyte–Luzon power line also crosses the strait through an overhead line at 11°23′36″N 124°59′04″E﻿ / ﻿11.39333°N 124.98444°E﻿ / 11.39333; 124.98444, using a tower on an uninhabited island in the strait.[citation needed] The Tacloban City harbor, the main port of the Eastern Visayas, is on Cancabato Bay at the southern entrance of the strait.
