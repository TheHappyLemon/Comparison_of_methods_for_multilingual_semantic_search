Lake Amadeus (together with Lake Neale, Pitjantjatjara: Pantu ("salt lakes")) is a large salt lake in the southwest corner of Northern Territory of Australia, about 50 kilometres (31Â mi) north of Uluru. The smaller Lake Neale is adjacent to the northwest. It is part of (or a surface feature of) the Amadeus Basin that was filled with the erosion products of the Petermann Orogeny.
