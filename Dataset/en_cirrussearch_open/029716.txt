The General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland (28 June 1812 – 30 April 1813, Polish Konfederacja Generalna Królestwa Polskiego) was a governing body of the Duchy of Warsaw created by Napoleon Bonaparte and the Polish political elite on the onset of Napoleon's campaign against Russia, which was proclaimed as "the second Polish war". It took the form of a confederated sejm (parliament). Officially assembled on the 28th of June, 1812, it oversaw the formal transformation of the Duchy of Warsaw into the "Kingdom of Poland". The newly renamed state laid claim to the territory annexed by the Russian Empire during the partitions, the so called "seized lands" or "seized country" (Polish Ziemie zabrane), which were formally retaken in July of 1812. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1813 and the Russian occupation of the Duchy, the Confederation's accomplishments were rendered null in practice.
