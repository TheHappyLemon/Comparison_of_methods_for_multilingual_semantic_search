Ennis (Irish: Inis, meaning 'island' or 'river meadow') is the county town of County Clare, in the mid-west of Ireland. The town lies on the River Fergus, north of where the river widens and enters the Shannon Estuary. Ennis is the largest town in County Clare, with a population of 27,923, making it the 6th largest town, and 11th largest urban settlement, as of the 2022 census. Dating from the 12th century the town's Irish name is short for Irish: Inis Cluana RÃ¡mhfhada, meaning "Island of the long rowing meadow", deriving from its location between two courses of the River Fergus.
