The 2018 Volta a Catalunya was a road cycling stage race that took place between 19 and 25 March 2018 in Spain. It was the 98th edition of the Volta a Catalunya and the ninth event of the 2018 UCI World Tour. For the second year in a row, and for the third time in his career, the race was won by Movistar Team rider Alejandro Valverde. Valverde won the second and fourth stages during the race, taking the race lead – and the mountains jersey as well – for good after his second stage victory. He finished 29 seconds clear of his nearest rival, team-mate Nairo Quintana, after Quintana's Colombian compatriot Egan Bernal (Team Sky) crashed out of the race on the final day. The podium was completed by AG2R La Mondiale's Pierre Latour, a further 18 seconds in arrears of Quintana; Bernal's withdrawal also allowed Latour to claim the young rider classification. The other jersey on offer for the sprints classification was claimed by Lluís Mas (Caja Rural–Seguros RGA), while the Movistar Team won the teams classification, after placing a third rider – Marc Soler – in the top-five overall. Before the start of the last stage, the women's reVolta was organised for the first time.
