The Finnish Wikipedia (Finnish: Suomenkielinen Wikipedia) is the edition of Wikipedia in the Finnish language. By article count, it is the 27th largest Wikipedia with about 570,000 articles as of April 2024. Wikipedia is the only encyclopedia in Finnish which is still updated. The Finnish language project was started in late 2002, but it remained at a very primitive stage until well into 2003. The speed of development picked up somewhat after the MediaWiki software was upgraded to Phase III in late November 2003, and continued to increase steadily through 2004. In 2013, the reliability of the Finnish Wikipedia was investigated by the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. The researchers used experts to evaluate quality of randomly selected 134 articles and found that 70% of the articles scored well for accuracy.
