Nokia 8210 is a mobile phone by Nokia, announced on 8 October 1999 in Paris. At the time, it was the smallest, lightest Nokia mobile phone on the market. A primary selling point of its design was its removable cover that allowed for easy customization. Six differently coloured Xpress-on covers are available, as well as many third-party ones. Nokia 8210 uses the GSM 900/1800 band, supports the Extended GSM 900 band (EGSM), and can automatically switch between bands.
