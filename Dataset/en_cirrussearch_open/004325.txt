Tula Mountains 66°54′S 51°6′E﻿ / ﻿66.900°S 51.100°E﻿ / -66.900; 51.100 The Tula Mountains are a group of extensive mountains lying immediately eastward of Amundsen Bay in Enderby Land, Antarctica. They were discovered on January 14, 1930, by the British Australian New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) under Mawson and named "Tula Range" by him after John Biscoe's brig, the Tula, from which Biscoe discovered Enderby Land in 1831. The term "mountains" was recommended for the group following an ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) sledge survey in 1958 by G.A. Knuckey.
