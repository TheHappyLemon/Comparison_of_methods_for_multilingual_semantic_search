Prometejs (Russian: Прометей, English translation: Prometheus) was an organisation of the Latvian diaspora in the interwar Soviet Union. Its members were former Red Latvian riflemen and other Latvian communists and their family members who settled in the USSR after the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. The organisation was disbanded in the early period of the Great Purge and many of its activists were murdered during the Latvian Operation of the NKVD.
