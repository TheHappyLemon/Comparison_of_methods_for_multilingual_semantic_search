Soledar (Ukrainian: Соледар, IPA: [soɫeˈdɑr]; Russian: Соледар, IPA: [səlʲɪˈdar]; lit. 'gift of salt') is a destroyed city in Bakhmut Raion, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. Situated in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, the city was formerly highly important for its salt mining industry, from which its name Soledar is derived. The last estimate of its population before its destruction was 10,490, in 2022. From 1925 until 1991, it was known as Karlo-Libknekhtovsk. During the battle of Soledar of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Soledar was completely destroyed and depopulated by Russian forces, who have occupied the ruins of the city and the surrounding area since January 2023.
