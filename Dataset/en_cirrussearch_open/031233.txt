A ballistic missile (BM) is a type of missile that uses projectile motion to deliver warheads on a target. These weapons are powered only during relatively brief periodsâ€”most of the flight is unpowered. Ballistic missiles differs in range; short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) stay within the Earth's atmosphere, while intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) are launched on a sub-orbital flight. They are internally guided, those for short range are typically inertial-guided while those for long range typically have more sophisticated guidance. These weapons are in a distinct category from cruise missiles, which are aerodynamically guided in powered flight. Unlike cruise missiles, which are restricted to the atmosphere, it is advantageous for ballistic missiles to avoid the denser parts of the atmosphere and they may travel above the atmosphere into outer space.
