Aymeric Jean Louis Gérard Alphonse Laporte (born 27 May 1994) is a professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr. Born in France, he plays for the Spain national team. He previously played for Basconia, Athletic Bilbao and Manchester City. When he joined Athletic Bilbao in 2010 at the age of 16, he became only the second player born in France—after Bixente Lizarazu—to play for them, going on to make 222 competitive appearances for the club. In January 2018, he signed for Manchester City. He was part of the side which won the first domestic treble in English men's football in 2019, and the country's second-ever continental treble in 2023. French by birth, Laporte won 51 caps for the country at youth international levels, and was called up to the senior team twice but remained uncapped. In 2021, after receiving Spanish citizenship and approval from FIFA to switch national teams, Laporte was named in Spain's squad for UEFA Euro 2020. He would then go on to represent the nation at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
