In geometry, a pentagon (from Greek: πέντε (pente), "five", and γωνία (gonia), "angle") is any five-sided polygon or 5-gon. The sum of the internal angles in a simple pentagon is 540°. A pentagon may be simple or self-intersecting. A self-intersecting regular pentagon (or star pentagon) is called a pentagram.
