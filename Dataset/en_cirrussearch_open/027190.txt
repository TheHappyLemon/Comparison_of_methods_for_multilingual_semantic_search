Digital architecture refers to aspects of architecture that feature digital technologies or considers digital platforms as online spaces. The emerging field of digital architectures therefore applies to both classic architecture as well as the emerging study of social media technologies. Within classic architectural studies, the terminology is used to apply to digital skins that can be streamed images and have their appearance altered. A headquarters building design for Boston television and radio station WGBH by Polshek Partnership has been discussed as an example of digital architecture and includes a digital skin. Within social media research, digital architecture refers to the technical protocols that enable, constrain, and shape user behavior in a virtual space. Features of social media platforms such as how they facilitate user connections, enable functionality, and generate data are considered key properties that distinguish one digital architecture from another.
