The Eurasian penduline tit or European penduline tit (Remiz pendulinus) is a passerine bird of the genus Remiz. It is relatively widespread throughout the western Palearctic. It is migratory in the northern part of its range but resident in the southern part. The breeding range in Western Europe experienced an expansion during the 1980s and 1990s. This was accompanied by an expansion of the speciesâ€™ winter range and reached as far south as northern Morocco. It builds an elaborate hanging nest, formerly used in Central Europe as children's slippers.
