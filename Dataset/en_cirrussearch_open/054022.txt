Abbe is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It is located just to the south of the crater Hess, and lies to the east of the large walled basin Poincar√©. It is named after the German physicist Ernst Abbe. The outer wall of Abbe is somewhat eroded, with small craters lying across the northwest and southwest rim crests. The interior floor is relatively smooth, with a few tiny craterlets marking the surface.
