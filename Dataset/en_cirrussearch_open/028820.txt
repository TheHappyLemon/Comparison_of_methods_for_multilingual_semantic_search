Hind is a lunar impact crater that lies to the southeast of the walled plain Hipparchus, and due east of the crater Halley. Its diameter is 29Â km. It was named after British astronomer John Russell Hind. The rim of Hind is relatively free of wear and distortion, except for a break at the north rim. The floor of Hind is relatively uneven, however, compared to the interior of Halley. Hind and the craters Hipparchus C and Hipparchus L form a line with diminishing diameters that point to the northeast.
