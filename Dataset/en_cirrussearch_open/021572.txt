Eco-Schools is an international programme of the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE) that aims to “empower students to be the change our sustainable world needs by engaging them in fun, action-orientated, and socially responsible learning.” Each school follows a seven step change process and aims to “empowers young people to lead processes and actions wherever they can.” Over time and through commitment to the Eco-Schools Seven Step process, improvements will be seen in both the learning outcomes, attitude, and behaviour of students and the local community, and ultimately the local environment. Evidence of success in these areas will eventually lead to a school being awarded with the International Green Flag. Eco-Schools is one of the programmes recognised by the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005 – 2014), awarding certificates to thousands of schools around the world. The Eco-Schools programme extends from kindergartens to universities and is implemented in 67 countries, involving 51,000 schools and institutions, and over 19,000,000 students. It is the largest international network of teachers and students in the world. FEE EcoCampus is the name of the programme at university level.
