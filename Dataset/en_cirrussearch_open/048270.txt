The flag of Serbia (Serbian Cyrillic: застава Србије, romanized: zastava Srbije), also known as the Tricolour (Serbian Cyrillic: тробојка, romanized: trobojka), is a tricolour consisting of three equal horizontal bands, red on the top, blue in the middle, and white on the bottom (on civil flag), with the lesser coat of arms left of center (on state flag). The same tricolour, in altering variations, has been used since the 19th century as the flag of the state of Serbia and the Serb people. The current form of the flag was adopted in 2004 and slightly redesigned in 2010.
