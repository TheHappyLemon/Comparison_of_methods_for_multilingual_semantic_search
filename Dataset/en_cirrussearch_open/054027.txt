Jastrzębie-Zdrój ([jastˈʂɛmbʲɛ ˈzdruj] ; German: Bad Königsdorff-Jastrzemb, originally Jastrzemb, Czech: Lázně Jestřebí; Silesian: Jastrzymbie-Zdroj) is a city in south Poland with 86,632 inhabitants (2021). Its name comes from the Polish words jastrząb ("hawk") and zdrój ("spa" or "spring"). From 1861 until the 20th century, it was a spa village situated in Upper Silesia. It was granted city rights in 1963. Jastrzębie-Zdrój is currently situated in the Silesian Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in Katowice Voivodeship (1975–1998). In the early 1980s, the city was one of main centers of workers' protests, which resulted in the creation of Solidarity.
