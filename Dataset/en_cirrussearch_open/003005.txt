Jelgava District (Latvian: Jelgavas rajons) was an administrative division of Latvia, located in Semigallia region, in the country's centre. It was organized into a city, two municipalities and twelve parishes, each with a local government authority. The administrative centre of the district was Jelgava. It preceded and used the symbols of the Jelgavas apriņķis [lv] of the interwar Republic of Latvia, which was created in 1920 from the previous Dobeles apriņķis. Districts were eliminated during the administrative-territorial reform in 2009.[citation needed]
