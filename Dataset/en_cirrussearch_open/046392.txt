Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, trading as Norwegian, is a Norwegian low-cost airline and Scandinavia's second-largest airline, behind Scandinavian Airlines. It is the fourth largest low-cost carrier in Europe behind Wizz Air, easyJet and Ryanair, the largest airline in Norway, and the ninth-largest airline in Europe in terms of passenger numbers. It offers a high-frequency domestic flight schedule within Scandinavia and Finland, and to business destinations such as London, as well as to holiday destinations in the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, transporting over 30 million people in 2016. The airline is known for its distinctive livery of white with a red nose, with portraits of high achievers on the tail fins of its aircraft. Norwegian's flights are operated by itself and Norwegian Air Sweden, a fully owned subsidiary. Each airline holds a unique air operator's certificate (AOC) but shares branding, corporate identity, and commercial functions. Until December 2019, Norwegian also owned and operated Norwegian Air Argentina, which operated domestic flights within the country. Until January 2021, Norwegian's former long-haul subsidiaries Norwegian Air UK and Norwegian Long Haul operated long-haul flights on behalf of the company, after which both subsidiaries were put into liquidation when long-haul operations were ended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until April 2021, Norwegian utilised Ireland-based Norwegian Air International for European-based operations outside of Norway or Sweden. On 18 December 2023, Norwegian Air Norway returned their only aircraft back to Norwegian Air Shuttle, and as such, was integrated back into them.
