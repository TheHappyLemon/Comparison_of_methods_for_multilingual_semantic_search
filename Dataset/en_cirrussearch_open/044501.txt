In chess, scholar's mate is the checkmate achieved by the following moves, or similar: 1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6?? 4. Qxf7# The same mating pattern may be reached by various move orders. For example, White might play 2.Bc4. In all variations, the basic idea is the same: the queen and bishop combine in a simple mating attack, occurring on f7 for White or on f2 for Black. Scholar's mate is sometimes referred to as the four-move checkmate, although there are other ways for checkmate to occur in four moves. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
