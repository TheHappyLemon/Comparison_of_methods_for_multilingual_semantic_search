During the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, athletes from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Republic of Macedonia competed as independent Olympic participants. Macedonian athletes could not appear under their own flag because their NOC had not been formed. FR Yugoslavia was under United Nations sanctions which prevented the country from taking part in the Olympics. Individual Yugoslav athletes were allowed to take part as independent Olympic participants (and as Independent Paralympic participants at the 1992 Summer Paralympics). 58 competitors (52 from FR Yugoslavia, 6 from Republic of Macedonia), 39 men and 19 women, took part in 54 events in 13 sports. Three athletes won medals in 1992 as independent Olympic participants, all in shooting.
