Barium oxide, also known as baria, is a white hygroscopic non-flammable compound with the formula BaO. It has a cubic structure and is used in cathode ray tubes, crown glass, and catalysts. It is harmful to human skin and if swallowed in large quantity causes irritation. Excessive quantities of barium oxide may lead to death. It is prepared by heating barium carbonate with coke, carbon black or tar or by thermal decomposition of barium nitrate.[citation needed]
