AEK Larnaca FC (Greek: AEK; for short Αθλητική Έvωση Κίτιον Λάρνακας, romanized: Athletiki Enosi Kition Larnakas, "Athletic Union Kition of Larnaca") is a Cypriot professional football club based in Larnaca. The club was formed in 1994 after a merger of two historical Larnaca clubs, EPA Larnaca and Pezoporikos. The club also has a men's basketball team, a women's volleyball team and a men's futsal team.[citation needed] The club's name comes from the ancient Greek city of Cyprus, Kition, which was located on the site of today's Larnaca. The colours of the club are yellow and green, and their emblem is admiral Kimon, who died at the seafront while defending the city of Kition circa 450 BC, in a fight against the Persians. He had told his officers to keep the news of his possible death secret. The quote "Και Νεκρος Ενικα" ("Even in death he was victorious") refers to Kimon. The club's key milestones - beside being runner-up for the league 5 times - , are qualifying to the 2011–12 and 2022–23 UEFA Europa League group stages, winning the Cypriot Cup in two instances in 2004 and 2018, its Champions League debut in 2022, and becoming the second Cypriot club to make the Round of 16 of a European competition, and the first to do so in the Europa Conference League.
