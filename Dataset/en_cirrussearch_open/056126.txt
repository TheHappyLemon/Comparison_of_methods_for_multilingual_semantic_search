The Zionist Organization Mizrachi (Latvian: Cionistu organizācija "Mizrahi") was a political party in the interbellum Latvia during 1921-1934. It won some seats in Latvian parliamentary elections in 1922, 1925, 1928, and 1931. The party was disbanded in 1934, after the Ulmanis authoritarian coup d'état, together with all other political parties.
