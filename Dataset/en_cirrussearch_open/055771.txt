The river Warta (/ˈvɑːrtə/ VAR-tə, Polish: [ˈvarta] ; German: Warthe [ˈvaʁtə] ; Latin: Varta) rises in central Poland and meanders greatly north-west to flow into the Oder, at the German border. About 808.2 kilometres (502.2 mi) long, it is Poland's second-longest river within its borders after the Vistula, and third-longest including the Oder, that flows also across Czech Republic and Germany. Its drainage basin covers 54,529 square kilometers (21,054 sq mi) and it is navigable from Kostrzyn nad Odrą to Konin, approximately half of its length. It is connected to the Vistula by the Noteć and the Bydgoszcz Canal (Kanał Bydgoski) near the city of Bydgoszcz.
