Nicknamed the deer due to his elegant tackles, he spent the majority of his 19-year professional career with Steaua București (ten seasons), winning the European Cup with that team and Red Star Belgrade, thus becoming the first player (to play in the final) to win the trophy with two clubs and the only player to win the trophy with two different Eastern European teams. In 1991 he was nominated for the Ballon d'Or. Belodedici also played in Spain and Mexico. Belodedici won 55 caps with Romania, representing the nation at the 1994 World Cup and two European Championships.
