The Udmurts (Udmurt: Удмуртъёс, Udmurtjos) are a Permian (Finno-Ugric) ethnic group in Eastern Europe, who speak the Udmurt language. During the course of the Russian Empire, Udmurts have been referred to mainly as Chud Otyatskaya (чудь отяцкая), Otyaks, Wotyaks or Votyaks, all being exonyms.[not verified in body] Today such exonyms are considered offensive by Udmurts themselves and are mainly used against those who have forgotten the Udmurt language. The Udmurts are closely related to Komis to their north, both linguistically and culturally.
