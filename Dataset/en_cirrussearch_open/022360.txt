The McDonald Islands are the emergent peaks of submarine volcanoes and are Australian external territory. Prior to 1992, there had not been an eruption in the previous 75,000 years. In 2024, it got some notoriety thanks to an intrigue between two fast food giants, McDonald's and Burger King. The latter wants to change the island name to Ilha Whopper (Whopper Island), affirming that "A place with real fire can't be named McDonald's".
