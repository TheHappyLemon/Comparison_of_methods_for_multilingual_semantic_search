A triangle is a polygon with three corners and three sides, one of the basic shapes in geometry. The corners, also called vertices, are zero-dimensional points while the sides connecting them, also called edges, are one-dimensional line segments. The triangle's interior is a two-dimensional region. Sometimes an arbitrary edge is chosen to be the base, in which case the opposite vertex is called the apex. In Euclidean geometry, any two points determine a unique line segment situated within a unique straight line, and any three points, when non-collinear, determine a unique triangle situated within a unique flat plane. More generally, several points in Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension determine a simplex. In non-Euclidean geometries three straight segments also determine a triangle, for instance a spherical triangle or hyperbolic triangle. A geodesic triangle is a region of a general two-dimensional surface enclosed by three sides which are straight relative to the surface. A curvilinear triangle is a shape with three curved sides, for instance a circular triangle with circular-arc sides. This article is about straight-sided triangles in Euclidean geometry, except where otherwise noted. A triangle with vertices A,{\displaystyle A,} B,{\displaystyle B,} and C{\displaystyle C} is denoted △ABC.{\displaystyle \triangle ABC.} In describing metrical relations within a triangle, it is common to represent the length of the edge opposite each vertex using a lower-case letter, letting a{\displaystyle a} be the length of the edge BC,{\displaystyle BC,} b{\displaystyle b} the length of CA,{\displaystyle CA,} and c{\displaystyle c} the length of AB{\displaystyle AB}; and to represent the angle measure at each corner using a Greek letter, letting α{\displaystyle \alpha } be the measure of angle ∠CAB,{\displaystyle \angle CAB,} β{\displaystyle \beta } the measure of ∠ABC,{\displaystyle \angle ABC,} and γ{\displaystyle \gamma } the measure of ∠BCA.{\displaystyle \angle BCA.}
