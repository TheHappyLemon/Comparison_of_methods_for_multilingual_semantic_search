Jodhpur (Hindi: IPA: [ˈd͡ʒoːd̪ʱpʊr]listen) is the second-largest city of the north-western Indian state of Rajasthan after its capital Jaipur, with the population of 1.03 million as of 2011 census. It serves as the administrative headquarters of the Jodhpur district and Jodhpur division. It is historic capital of the Kingdom of Marwar, founded in 1459 by Rao Jodha of the Rathore clan of Rajputs. Jodhpur is a popular tourist destination, featuring many palaces, forts, and temples, set in the stark landscape of the Thar Desert. Jodhpur is also known as the Blue City due to the dominant color scheme of its buildings in old town. The old city circles the Mehrangarh Fort and is bounded by a wall with several gates. The city has expanded greatly outside the wall, though over the past several decades. Jodhpur lies near the geographic centre of the Rajasthan state, which makes it a convenient base for travel in a region much frequented by tourists.
