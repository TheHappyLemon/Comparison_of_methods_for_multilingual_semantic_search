Forth is the fourth and final studio album by the English alternative rock band the Verve before their third break up in 2009. It was released internationally on 25 August 2008 on EMI and a day later in North America on the On Your Own label. The band reformed in 2007, having broken up in 1999. Forth was their first album of new material since their 1997 album Urban Hymns and their first since 1995's A Northern Soul to feature the original line-up without second guitarist and keyboardist Simon Tong. It is also the second album to feature the Urban Hymns and Ashcroft's solo album producer Chris Potter. The album's first single, "Love Is Noise", received its first airplay on BBC Radio 1 on 23 June 2008. The song reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart and became a summer hit in Europe. The band also released a non-album track, "Mover", as a free download a week later.
