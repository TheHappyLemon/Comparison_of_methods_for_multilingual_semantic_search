Atatürk Airport (IATA: ISL, ICAO: LTBA) (former IATA code: IST) (Turkish: Atatürk Havalimanı) was the primary international airport of Istanbul until it was closed to commercial passenger flights on 6 April 2019. From that point, all flights were transferred to the new Istanbul Airport. All freight operations subsequently relocated as well by 5 February 2022 after which the airport continued to serve general aviation until its final closure. It used to be the hub of Turkish Airlines; however, it is now only in use for private jets.
