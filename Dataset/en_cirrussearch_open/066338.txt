A boulevard is a type of broad avenue planted with rows of trees, or in parts of North America, any urban highway or wide road in a commercial district. Boulevards were originally circumferential roads following the line of former city walls. In North American usage, boulevards may be wide, multi-lane thoroughfares divided with only a central median.
