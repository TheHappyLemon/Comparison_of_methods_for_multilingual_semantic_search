Subdivisions of the Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth evolved over for centuries of its existence from the signing of the Union of Lublin to the third partition. The lands that once belonged to the Commonwealth are now largely distributed among several central, eastern, and northern European countries: Poland (except western Poland), Lithuania, Latvia, Belarus, most of Ukraine, parts of Russia, southern half of Estonia, and smaller pieces in Slovakia and Moldova.
