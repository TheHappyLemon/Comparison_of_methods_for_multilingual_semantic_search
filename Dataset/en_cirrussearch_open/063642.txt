The inner Principality of Kiev (Old East Slavic: Киевское кънѧжьство, romanized: Kievskoe kŭnęzhĭstvo;[citation needed] Ukrainian: Київське князівство, romanized: Kyivske kniazivstvo) was a medieval East Slavic state, situated in central regions of modern Ukraine around the city of Kiev. The principality was formed during the process of political fragmentation of the Kievan Rus' in the early 12th century. As a result of that process, the effective rule of the Grand Princes of Kiev was gradually reduced to central regions of Kievan Rus' (around its capital city Kiev), thus forming a reduced princely domain, known as the inner Principality of Kiev. It existed as a polity until the middle of the 14th century.
