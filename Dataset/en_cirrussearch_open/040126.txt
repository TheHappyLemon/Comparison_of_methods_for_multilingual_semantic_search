Fu√üballclub Red Bull Salzburg, or simply Red Bull Salzburg, or just Salzburg, is an Austrian professional football club based in Wals-Siezenheim, that competes in the Austrian Bundesliga, the top flight of Austrian Football. Their home ground is the Red Bull Arena. Due to sponsorship restrictions, the club is known as FC Salzburg and wears a modified crest when playing in UEFA competitions. The club was known as SV Austria Salzburg, and had several sponsored names, before being bought by Red Bull GmbH in 2005 who renamed the club and changed its colours from its traditional violet and white to red and white. The change resulted in some of the team's fans forming a new club, SV Austria Salzburg. Founded in 1933, the club won its first Bundesliga title in 1994, which was the first of three in the span of four seasons which also saw them reach the 1994 UEFA Cup final. The club has won seventeen league titles and nine Austrian Cups, all nine of which came as doubles, as well as three Austrian Supercups. Salzburg has dominated Austrian football over the recent past, winning 14 league titles in 17 seasons including the latest 10 in a row.
