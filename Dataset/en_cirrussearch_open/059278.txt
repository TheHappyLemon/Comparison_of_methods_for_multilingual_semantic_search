Originally planned to be released theatrically in the United States on October 1, 2021, Sony Pictures Releasing cancelled the film's release plans and sold the film's distribution rights to Amazon Studios for $100Â million, due to rising cases of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in the United States. Hotel Transylvania: Transformania was released exclusively on Amazon Prime Video on January 14, 2022, and theatrically in China on April 3. The film received mixed reviews from critics with the Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus calling it "middling family viewing -- relatively painless, but overall rather uninspired".
