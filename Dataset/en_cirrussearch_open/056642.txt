Tindhólmur is an islet on the southside of Sørvágsfjørður, west of Vágar in the Faroe Islands. It has its name from the five peaks, which are named Ytsti, Arni, Lítli, Breiði, Bogni (Farthest, Eagle, Small, Broad, Bent). The islet is uninhabited. It has an area of 65 hectares (160 acres) – or in old Faroese style, two merkur – and its highest point is at an elevation of 262 metres (860 ft). Formerly, it was a nesting place for the white-tailed eagle.
