In mathematics, a geometric transformation is any bijection of a set to itself (or to another such set) with some salient geometrical underpinning. More specifically, it is a function whose domain and range are sets of points — most often both R2{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} or both R3{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} — such that the function is bijective so that its inverse exists. The study of geometry may be approached by the study of these transformations.
