Shanxi is an inland province of China and is part of the North China region. The capital and largest city of the province is Taiyuan, while its next most populated prefecture-level cities are Changzhi and Datong. Its one-character abbreviation is "晋" (pinyin: Jìn), after the state of Jin that existed there during the Spring and Autumn period. The name Shanxi means "West of the Mountains", a reference to the province's location west of the Taihang Mountains. Shanxi borders Hebei to the east, Henan to the south, Shaanxi to the west and Inner Mongolia to the north. Shanxi's terrain is characterised by a plateau bounded partly by mountain ranges. Shanxi's culture is largely dominated by the ethnic Han majority, who make up over 99% of its population. Jin Chinese is considered by some linguists to be a distinct language from Mandarin and its geographical range covers most of Shanxi. Both Jin and Mandarin are spoken in Shanxi. Shanxi is a leading producer of coal in China, possessing roughly a third of China's total coal deposits. Nevertheless, Shanxi's GDP per capita remains below the national average. The province hosts the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center. The province is also known for having by far the largest number of historic buildings among all Chinese provinces, by possessing over 70% of China's surviving buildings built during or predating the Song dynasty. Also notable are the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, Shanxi, which date back over 1500 years. The site is located about 16 kilometers west of Datong City, in the ten-mile valley at the foothills of Wuzhou Mountain. They are outstanding representatives of Chinese stone sculptures from the fifth and sixth centuries. There are 53 main caves, and 51,000 Buddhist niches housing an equal number of Buddha statues. In addition, there are approximately 1,100 small caves. A Ming Dynasty fortress still remains on the cliff top of Yungang Grottoes. [1]https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yungang_Grottoes
