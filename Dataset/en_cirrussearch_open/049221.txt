Bandslam is a 2009 American musical romantic comedy drama film directed by Todd Graff, who co-wrote the screenplay with Josh A. Cagan, based on a story by Cagan. The film stars Aly Michalka, Vanessa Hudgens, Gaelan Connell, Scott Porter, and Lisa Kudrow. The story revolves around Will (Connell) and Charlotte (Michalka), who form an unlikely bond through their shared love of music. Assembling a like-minded crew of misfits, the friends form a rock group and perform in a battle of the bands competition called "Bandslam". Principal photography took place in Austin, Texas. During filming, the film underwent multiple title changes, including Will and Rock On. Bandslam premiered at the Mann Village Theatre in Westwood, Los Angeles, on August 6, 2009, and was released in the United States on August 14, by Summit Entertainment. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the acting and soundtrack. However, the film was a commercial failure, grossing only $12.2 million worldwide against a $20 million budget. Insiders panned the film's marketing, which many cited as a primary reason for the film's underperformance at the box-office. In a brief cameo appearance, this was David Bowie's final film appearance before his death in 2016.
