.is (dot is) is the top-level domain for Iceland. The country code is derived from the first two letters of Ísland, which is the Icelandic word for Iceland. Registration of .is domains is open to all people and companies without any special restriction. The first .is domain, hi.is, is the domain of Háskóli Íslands (University of Iceland). It was registered on December 11, 1986, making it one of the earliest ever domain registrations on the Internet. According to McAfee report "Mapping the Mal Web," .is was evaluated as one of the top 10 most secure TLDs in the world in the years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. No report has come out since then. As of December 2022[update], there were just over 86,000 .is domains registered. As of October 2016[update], .is domains can be registered for up to five years.
