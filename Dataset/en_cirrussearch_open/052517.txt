The 2018 European Athletics Championships were held in Berlin, Germany, from 6 to 12 August 2018. The championships were part of the first European Championships with other events happening in the United Kingdom. For the second Championships in a row the Russian team did not participate; this was due to the suspension of the All-Russia Athletic Federation by the International Association of Athletics Federations. However, several athletes were cleared by the IAAF to compete as Authorised Neutral Athletes under the flag of the European Athletic Association. Mariya Lasitskene became the first such athlete to win a gold medal, in the women's high jump.
