The Nokia 9300 is a Nokia Series 80 Symbian mobile phone introduced in 2004. It is used as a normal though bulky mobile phone in closed mode, when it is flipped open it can be used like a very small notebook computer with a 640Ã—200 screen. The phone also has speakerphone functionality, which is activated automatically when the phone is flipped open. An MP3 player is also built into the phone. It didn't have vibration motor due to its shape. The Nokia 9300 was released shortly after the Nokia 9500 Communicator. Although very similar to the 9500 Communicator, this less expensive model was not officially marketed under the Communicator name by Nokia. In the United States, the 9300b was sold through Cingular's Business division. The Nokia 9300 PDA phone was a prominent feature in Live Free or Die Hard, used by character Matt Farrell. The Nokia 9300i is an updated version with WiFi capability
