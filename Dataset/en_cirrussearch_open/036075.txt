Macrobius is a prominent lunar impact crater located to the northwest of the Mare Crisium. Its diameter is 63Â km. It was named after ancient Roman writer Macrobius. It lies on the southeast edge of the Lacus Bonitatis, a small lunar mare. The somewhat smaller crater Tisserand lies just to the east. The outer wall of Macrobius has a multiply terraced inner surface, with some slumping along the top of the rim. The small satellite crater Macrobius C lies across the western rim, but the wall is otherwise relatively free of significant wear. In the center of the floor is a central mountain complex. There is a low ridge in the western interior, but the remainder of the floor is relatively level. Macrobius is a crater of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.
