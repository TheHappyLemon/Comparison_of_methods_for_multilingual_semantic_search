The North Vidzeme Biosphere Reserve (NVBR) (Latvian: Ziemeļvidzemes biosfēras rezervāts) is the only biosphere reserve in Latvia, located in the northern Vidzeme region in north-western Latvia along the border with Estonia. The reserve includes varied natural and semi-natural habitats in primal and traditional landscapes. NVBR includes 25 nature reserves, one nature park and two marine protected territories. NVBR generates nature tourism via the river Salaca, which starts its 95 km long journey from Lake Burtnieks and ends in the Baltic Sea.
