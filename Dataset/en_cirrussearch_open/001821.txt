Xtort (stylized as XTOÐ¯T) is the eighth studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released on June 25, 1996, by Wax Trax! Records. It was recorded from the end of 1995 through early 1996, shortly after the death of Wax Trax! co-founder and band friend Jim Nash. Xtort features a variety of guest artists from the industrial music scene and studio musicians from other genres, but includes limited participation from core member En Esch. The album was massively promoted by KMFDM's American label TVT Records, which pressed tens of thousands of copies of its lead single "Power". Frontman Sascha Konietzko created his own form of promotion, issuing a press release that both disparaged and lauded the coming set. Xtort was generally well-received by critics and is the band's highest-charting album to date. After the original release went out of print, a remastered version was released in 2007.
