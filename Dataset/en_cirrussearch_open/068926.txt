Fruška gora (Serbian Cyrillic: Фрушка гора; Hungarian: Tarcal-hegység) is a mountain in Syrmia, administratively part of Serbia with a part of its western side extending into eastern Croatia. The area under Serbian administration forms the country's oldest national park. Sometimes also referred to as the Jewel of Serbia, due to its largely pristine landscape and protection effort, or the Serbian Mount Athos, being the home of a large number of historical Serbian Orthodox monasteries.
