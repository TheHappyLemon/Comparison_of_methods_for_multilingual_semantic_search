Komi (коми кыв, komi kyv), also known as Zyran, Zyrian or Komi-Zyryan (зыран коми кыв, zyran komi kyv), is one of the two regional varieties of the pluricentric Komi language, the other regional variety being Permyak. Komi is natively spoken by the Komi peoples native to the Komi Republic and other parts of Russia such as Nenetsia and Yamalia. There were 285,000 speakers in 1994, which decreased to 160,000 in 2010. Komi has a standardized form.[citation needed] It was written in the Old Permic script (Komi: 𐍐𐍝𐍑𐍣𐍠‎, Анбур, Anbur) created by Stephen of Perm for liturgical purposes in the 14th century, though very few texts exist in this script. The Cyrillic script was introduced by Russian missionaries in the 17th century, replacing it. A tradition of secular works of literature in the modern form of the language dates back to the 19th century.
