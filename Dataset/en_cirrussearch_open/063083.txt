The 2022–23 Bundesliga was the 60th season of the Bundesliga, Germany's premier football competition. It began on 5 August 2022 and concluded on 27 May 2023. Bayern Munich were the ten-time consecutive defending champions and retained their title. Going into the final match-day on 27 May, Borussia Dortmund needed a home win over Mainz 05 to clinch the title, irrespective of Bayern's result. However, they drew 2–2, and Jamal Musiala's late winner against 1. FC Köln sealed the eleventh consecutive Bundesliga for Bayern. This was the first time since the 1999–2000 season, when Bayern pipped Bayer Leverkusen on goal difference, that the title was decided by a tiebreaker and a team won the title after starting the day second. Schalke 04 and Hertha BSC were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga. Bayern Munich celebrated a double championship when both the women's team and the men's team won the top national football leagues within two days.
