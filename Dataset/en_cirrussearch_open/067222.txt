Since the Revolution of Dignity, the party has not competed in elections and members have slowly dispersed; the last election in which the party participated was the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election. The best-known former party members are former Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and former President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych; both fled to Russia in February 2014 after Euromaidan. The Eighth Administrative Court of Appeal banned the party on 21 February 2023.
