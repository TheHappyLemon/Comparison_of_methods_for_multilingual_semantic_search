Georges Ronsse (4 March 1906, Antwerp - 4 July 1969, Berchem) was a two-time national cyclo-cross and two-time world champion road bicycle racer from Belgium, who raced between 1926 and 1938. In addition to his several national and world championships, Ronsse won several of the classic races in road cycling including the 1925 Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the 1927 Paris–Roubaix, and the 1927, 1929 and 1930 editions of the now-defunct Bordeaux–Paris. He won his first world championship title in 1928 in Budapest with a lead of 19 minutes and 43 seconds over second-placed finisher Herbert Nebe, the largest winning margin in road world championship history. In 1932, Ronsse capped off his career with a Stage 4 win at the 1932 Tour de France. After retiring from competition he served as manager of the Belgian national team at the Tour.
