Courland Governorate, also known as the Province of Courland or Governorate of Kurland, and known from 1795 to 1796 as the Viceroyalty of Courland, was an administrative-territorial unit (guberniya) and one of the Baltic governorates of the Russian Empire. Its area roughly corresponded to parts of modern-day Latvia. The governorate was created in 1795 out of the territory of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, which was incorporated into the Russian Empire as the Viceroyalty of Courland with its capital at Mitau (now Jelgava) following the third partition of the Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth. After a failed post-World War I attempt to create a United Baltic Duchy as a client state of the German Empire, Courland and Livonia were united to form the Republic of Latvia on 18 November 1918.
