The North Siberian Lowland (Russian: Северо-Сибирская низменность, romanized: Severo-Sibirskaya nizmennost; Yakut: Хотугу Сибиир намтала), also known as Taymyr Lowland (Russian: Таймырская низменность, romanized: Taymyrskaya nizmennost), is a plain with a relatively flat relief separating the Byrranga Mountains of the Taymyr Peninsula in the north from the Central Siberian Plateau in the south. To the southeast of the Olenyok basin the lowland merges with the Central Yakutian Lowland. The territory of the lowland is one of the Great Russian Regions. Administratively it is mostly part of the Krasnoyarsk Krai, with a small section in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). The main towns are Dudinka, Norilsk and Khatanga.
