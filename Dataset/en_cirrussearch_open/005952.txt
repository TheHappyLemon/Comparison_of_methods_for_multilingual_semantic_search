Battlefield Heroes was a 2009 third-person shooter video game initially developed by DICE, further developed by Easy Studios, and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows. A free-to-play spinoff of the Battlefield series, Battlefield Heroes was designed to be less demanding on computer specifications than the previous games in the series. This change was made to increase the player base, as well as to match players of similar skill levels together for fairer play. Heroes was the first Battlefield game to be made under Electronic Arts' "Play 4 Free" model, which saw the game released for free with revenue generated from advertising and micropayments. Advertisements appeared on the website and in game screens, although no ads appeared while playing. Micropayments could be made for additional items to customize the appearance of a player's avatar or to buy stronger weapons. Play 4 Free Funds (formerly known as Battlefunds) were purchasable in-game via real-world money and used for acquiring rate boosts to experience points and other items. Battlefield Heroes received mixed to positive reviews and went offline on 14 July 2015, alongside fellow EA free-to-play titles Battlefield Play4Free, Need for Speed: World, and FIFA World.
