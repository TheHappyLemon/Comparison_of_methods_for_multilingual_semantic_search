The Ik (Russian: Ик; Tatar: Ык, Iq; Bashkir: Ыҡ, Iq) is a river in Russia that flows north to the Kama. It flows through the Republics of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan and through Orenburg Oblast. The left tributaries are Mellya, Menzelya, Dymka, and the right tributary is Usen. It is 571 kilometres (355 mi) long, and its drainage basin covers 18,100 square kilometres (7,000 sq mi). The time difference between Bavly in Tatarstan and Oktyabrsky in Bashkortostan is two hours (Tatarstan uses Moscow Time and Bashkortostan uses Yekaterinburg Time). Therefore, the bridge through Ik (river-border) is jokingly called "the longest bridge in the world".
