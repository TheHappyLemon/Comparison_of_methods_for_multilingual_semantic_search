The men's one hand lift, an event similar to the modern snatch, was one of two weightlifting events in the weightlifting at the 1896 Summer Olympics programme. Viggo Jensen, injured from the first event, was able to lift only enough to earn a silver medal while Launceston Elliot far surpassed all of the other athletes in the field on his way to winning the United Kingdom's first gold medal of the Olympics. Alexandros Nikolopoulos lifted 57.0 kilograms with one hand, which would have put him in a tie with Jensen had he lifted the same weight with his other hand. He lifted only 40.0 kilograms with the other, but was awarded third place as Sotirios Versis could only lift 40.0 with either hand. Prince George of Greece and Denmark, one of the judges, demonstrated his strength after the event by moving one of the heavy weights with ease after an assistant struggled to clear the weight from the competition area.
