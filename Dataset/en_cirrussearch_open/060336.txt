The women's ski cross competition in freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 17 February, at the Genting Snow Park in Zhangjiakou. Sandra Näslund of Sweden won the event, which was her first Olympic medal. Marielle Thompson of Canada, the 2014 champion, won the silver medal. The bronze medal was split between Fanny Smith of Switzerland and Daniela Maier of Germany following a Court of Arbitration of Sport decision on 13 December 2022 in regards to an interference call in the final. The 2018 champion, Kelsey Serwa, retired from competitions. The silver medalist Brittany Phelan and the bronze medalist Fanny Smith qualified for the Olympics. At the 2021–22 FIS Freestyle Ski World Cup, before the Olympics, Näslund won all events but one and consequently led the ranking, followed by Smith. Näslund was also the 2021 world champion, while Smith was the silver medalist.
