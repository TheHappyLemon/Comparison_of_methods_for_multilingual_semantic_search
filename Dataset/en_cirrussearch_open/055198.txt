X-Men is an American superhero film series based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. 20th Century Fox obtained the film rights to the team and other related characters in 1994 for $2.6 million. After numerous drafts, Bryan Singer was hired to direct the first film, released in 2000, and its sequel, X2 (2003), while the third installment of the original trilogy, X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), was directed by Brett Ratner. After each film outgrossed its predecessor, a further ten films were released set in the same shared universe, with spin-offs including three Wolverine films (2009–2017), two Deadpool films (2016–2018), and two television series titled Legion (2017–2019) and The Gifted (2017–2019). The 2011 prequel X-Men: First Class acted as a soft reboot of the original franchise followed by its 2014 sequel X-Men: Days of Future Past establishing a new fictional timeline focusing on younger iterations of existing characters, continued into a full tetralogy by X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) and Dark Phoenix (2019). The stand-alone New Mutants concluded the series in 2020 after a 20-year-long run. The X-Men film series has been well received by several critics during its run, with X-Men: Days of Future Past and Logan being their most acclaimed films and with both being considered to be two of the greatest superhero films ever made. With thirteen films released, the X-Men film series is the tenth-highest-grossing film series, having grossed over $6 billion worldwide. In March 2019, Marvel Studios regained the film rights to the X-Men, along with the Fantastic Four and Deadpool, after Disney acquired Fox for $71.3 billion; they are planned to be integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In October 2020, the films in the X-Men series, along with the Fantastic Four films, were rebranded as "Marvel Legacy films" on Disney+. Patrick Stewart later reprised his role as an alternate Charles Xavier / Professor X in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). Kelsey Grammer reprised his role as an alternate Hank McCoy / Beast in The Marvels (2023). Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), a sequel to the X-Men film Deadpool 2 (2018), will integrate the series' iterations of Wade Wilson / Deadpool and Wolverine into the continuity of the MCU, respectively reprised by Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. A new film featuring the team, which will reboot the franchise for the MCU, entered the early stages of development in September 2023. Disney+ further updated branding of the X-Men series (alongside the live-action TV shows and animated series) in July 2023, giving it the title "Mutant Legacy".
