The SpongeBob SquarePants film series consists of American animated/live-action children's-comedies, based on and a continuation of the animated television series of the same name. The films are produced by Nickelodeon Movies and distributed by Paramount Pictures (streaming by Netflix or Paramount+). The films feature the regular television voice cast: Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Rodger Bumpass, Clancy Brown, Mr. Lawrence, Jill Talley, Carolyn Lawrence, Mary Jo Catlett, and Lori Alan. Plans for a film based on the series began in 2001 when Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures began approaching series creator Stephen Hillenburg for a theatrical feature. He initially refused their offers, but began developing it in 2002 upon completion of the show's third season. Hillenburg directed the film, titled The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, which was theatrically released in the United States on November 19, 2004, to critical and commercial success. It was originally planned to act as the series finale, but the series success led to the production of more episodes. Sponge Out of Water, directed by former showrunner Paul Tibbitt, followed in 2015. A third film, Sponge on the Run, was directed by former show writer Tim Hill and released in 2020. As of February 2022, four additional films were announced to be in development, including a fourth theatrical film, titled The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants, set to be released in December 2025, and three spin-off films being developed for streaming release on Paramount+ and Netflix.
