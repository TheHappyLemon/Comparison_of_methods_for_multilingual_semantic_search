François-Adrien Boieldieu (pronounced [fʁɑ̃.swa a.dʁi.(j)ɛ̃ bɔ.jɛl.djø], also [bwa(.ɛ)l.djø]) (16 December 1775 – 8 October 1834) was a French composer, mainly of operas, often called "the French Mozart". His date of birth was given as December 15 by his biographer Lucien Augé de Lassus (b. 1841) and as September 15 by some local press releases. Although his reputation is largely based upon his operas, Boieldieu composed other works and among them, his Harp Concerto in C (1800–1801) is a masterpiece of the harp repertory.
