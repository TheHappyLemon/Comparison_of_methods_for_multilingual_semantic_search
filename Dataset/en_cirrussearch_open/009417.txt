The Southern Bridge (Latvian: Dienvidu tilts) is an extradosed bridge built across the Daugava River in Riga, the capital of Latvia. The bridge was constructed between 2004 and 2008, and was opened on November 17, 2008. Construction of the access roads lasted until 2013. Because of the bridge's huge cost it also become colloquially known as The Golden Bridge (Zelta tilts).
