Linzer Athletik-Sport-Klub, commonly known as Linzer ASK (German pronunciation: [lask lÉªnts] ) or simply LASK, is an Austrian professional football club based in Upper-Austrian state capital Linz. It is the oldest football club in that region, and plays in the Austrian Football Bundesliga, the top tier of Austrian football. The club's colours are black and white. The women's team plays in the second highest division of Austrian women's football. It is one of the few clubs of the country's higher divisions that, since coming into existence, never exhibited a sponsor in the official club name. In 1965, the club became the first team outside Vienna to win the Austrian football championship, with this being its only league title to date. The club currently plays its home games at the Raiffeisen Arena in Linz.
