Lasiorhinus is the genus containing the two extant hairy-nosed wombats, which are found in Australia. The southern hairy-nosed wombat is found in some of the semiarid to arid regions belt from New South Wales southwest to the South Australia-Western Australia border. The IUCN categorises it as Near Threatened. Conversely, the northern hairy-nosed wombat is categorised as Critically Endangered and only survives in a 3-square-kilometre (1.2 sq mi) range within the Epping Forest National Park in Queensland, but formerly also existed in Victoria and New South Wales.
