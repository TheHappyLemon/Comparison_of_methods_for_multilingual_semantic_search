The University of the Faroe Islands (Faroese: Fróðskaparsetur Føroya) is a state-run university located in Tórshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands. It consists of five faculties: Faculty of Faroese Language and Literature, Faculty of Social Sciences and History, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Science and Technology and Faculty of Health Sciences. The University offers bachelors, masters, and Ph.D. programs. The student body is relatively small (around 1000). The University organises an annual dissertation competition open to all students. The educational language of the university is Faroese, making it the only university in the world to conduct classes officially in the Faroese language. Some classes are taught in other languages. The University works closely with the University of Copenhagen and the University of Iceland for research projects and is a member of UArctic.
