Microvascular angina, previously known as cardiac syndrome X, is angina (chest pain) with signs associated with decreased blood flow to heart tissue but with normal coronary arteries. The use of the term CSX can lead to the lack of appreciation of how microvascular angina is a debilitating heart related pain condition with the increased risk of heart attack and other heart problems. Women may have difficulty accessing the specialist care of a cardiologist for this reason.[citation needed] Some studies have found increased risk of other vasospastic disorders in cardiac microvascular angina patients, such as migraine and Raynaud's phenomenon. It is treated with beta-blockers, such as metoprolol however beta blockers can make coronary spasms worse. This is a distinct diagnosis from variant angina.
