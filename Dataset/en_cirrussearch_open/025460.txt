"Putin – khuylo!" or "Putin – khuilo!" is a slogan deriding Russian President Vladimir Putin, commonly translated as "Putin [is a] dickhead!" It originated in Ukraine in 2014, having grown from a football chant first performed by FC Metalist Kharkiv ultras and Shakhtar Donetsk ultras in March 2014 at the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The phrase has become a protest song and is widely spread in Ukraine amongst supporters of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as those opposing Vladimir Putin in both Russia and Ukraine.
