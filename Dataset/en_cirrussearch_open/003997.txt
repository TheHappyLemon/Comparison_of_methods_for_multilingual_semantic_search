The AMA Motocross Championship (commercially known as Pro Motocross Championship) is an American motorcycle racing series. The motocross race series was founded and sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) in 1972. The series is the major outdoor motocross series in the United States and is sanctioned by AMA Pro Racing and managed by MX Sports Pro Racing. With respect to the MXGP holding the discipline's worldwide title, and the advent of the FIM Supercross World Championship resulting in the AMA Supercross Championship losing its world title status, the two series will form the SuperMotocross World Championship from 2023.
