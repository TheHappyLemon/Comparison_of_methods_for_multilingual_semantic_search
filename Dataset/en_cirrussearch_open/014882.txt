"Point Me at the Sky" is the fifth UK single by the English band Pink Floyd, released on 6 December 1968. It was their last single in the UK for nearly a decade. The song was an early collaboration by bassist Roger Waters and guitarist David Gilmour. The single was not released in the US, but was in Canada, Japan, and some European countries. The vocals on the verse of the song are sung by Gilmour, and the bridge vocals are shared between Gilmour and Waters. Promotional UK copies and some foreign releases mistakenly printed the title "Point Me to the Sky" on the label or sleeve.
