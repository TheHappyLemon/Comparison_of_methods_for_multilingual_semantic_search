The Qatar national football team (Arabic: منتخب قَطَر لِكُرَّةُ الْقَدَم) nicknamed The Maroons, represents Qatar in international football, and is controlled by the Qatar Football Association and AFC. They play their home games at Khalifa International Stadium and Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium. The latter is considered the home stadium. Qatar is a member of both the FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The team won the Arabian Gulf Cup in 1992, 2004 and 2014. They have appeared in ten Asian Cup tournaments and won it twice in 2019 and 2023, beating Japan, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea in the process during 2019, conceding just one goal. Qatar hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup and therefore qualified automatically for what was their first appearance in the event. It was the first time an Arab nation hosted the competition. On 25 November 2022, Qatar were the first team to be eliminated from the World Cup; subsequently, they became the worst performing host nation in the history of the FIFA World Cup, not winning a single game. Qatar has footballing rivalries with Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.
