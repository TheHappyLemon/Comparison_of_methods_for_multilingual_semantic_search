Borshchiv Raion (Ukrainian: Борщівський район, romanized: Borschivs’kyi raion), historically known as Bezirk Borszczów, was a raion (district) within Ternopil Oblast in western Ukraine, in a historical region known as Galicia and bordering Podollia. The administrative center of the raion was Borshchiv, its only city. The district encompassed Borshchiv, two towns, five hromadas and 70 villages. Mainly agricultural, its warmer climate supported a variety of crops including wheat, sugar beets, tobacco, barley and hemp. The district's human history dates back to the Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods, and several archaeological sites have been dated back to the earliest human occupation of Ukraine, as well as to later Bronze Age occupations. During the Middle Ages, modern-day Borshchiv Raion fell under Kievan Rus' and then Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth rule. The raion was merged into Chortkiv Raion on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine. The last estimate of the raion population was 64,966 (2020 est.).
