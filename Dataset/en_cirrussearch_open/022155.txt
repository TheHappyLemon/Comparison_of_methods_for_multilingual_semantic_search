The curling competition of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held at the Ice Cube Curling Center, nicknamed "the Ice Cube". It is the sixth time that curling was on the Olympic program. In both the men's and women's competitions, ten nations competed. These two events took place from 10 to 21 February 2014. The Canadian women's team went through the whole competition undefeated, the first time this has happened in an Olympic women's curling competition. Additionally, both the Canadian men's and women's teams won the gold medal, becoming the first country to do so in the history of the event.
