"Jump" is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Written by and produced by Madonna and Stuart Price with additional writing by Joe Henry, the song was supposed to be released as the third single of the album. However, since "Get Together" was decided as the third single based on its digital sales, "Jump" was sent to hot adult contemporary radios in the United States as the fourth and final single from the album on September 11, 2006, by Warner Bros. Records. The song incorporates pop, synth-pop, techno and disco music with tributes to Pet Shop Boys. Madonna sings in her lower register in the song. Its lyrics talk about self-empowerment and sufficiency while looking for the prospects of a new relationship. Upon release, "Jump" received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the club anthem-like quality of the song. Commercially, "Jump" peaked inside the top ten of the charts of some European countries, topping the charts in Italy and Hungary. In the United States, "Jump" placed in several Billboard dance charts, although it did not enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The music video for the song was shot in Tokyo during Madonna's 2006 Confessions Tour stopover. It portrayed Madonna in a blond bob wig and a leather ensemble singing the song in front of a number of neon signs. The video also featured dancers who performed the physical discipline parkour. It was also performed on her Confessions Tour, where Madonna and her dancers jumped around the stage actively, while singing the song. The song was used in the movie The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and the Ugly Betty season 2 finale in 2008.
