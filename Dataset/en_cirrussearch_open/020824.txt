Zittau (Upper Sorbian: Žitawa [ˈʒitawa]; Lower Sorbian: Žytawa [ˈʒɨtawa]; Polish: Żytawa; Czech: Žitava; Upper Lusatian dialect: Sitte) is the southeasternmost city in the German state of Saxony, and is located in the district of Görlitz, Germany's easternmost district. It has a population of around 25,000, and is one of the most important cities in the region of Lusatia (Upper Lusatia). The inner city of Zittau still shows its original beauty with many houses from several architectural periods: the famous town hall built in an Italian style, the church of St John and the stables (Salzhaus) with its medieval heritage. This multi-storied building is one of the oldest of its kind in Germany.[citation needed] Zittau is the birthplace of the German composer Heinrich Marschner.
