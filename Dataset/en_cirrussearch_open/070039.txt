The Alfa Romeo 147 (Type 937) is a small family car produced by the Italian automaker Alfa Romeo from 2000 to 2010. The 147 was voted European Car of the Year in 2001. The 147 was launched at the Turin Motor Show in June 2000 as a replacement for the Alfa Romeo 145 and 146 hatchbacks and is based on the running gear of the larger 156 saloon. It was sold with 1.6, 2.0, and 3.2-liter petrol engines, and a 1.9-liter diesel engine. A paddle-operated Selespeed automatic transmission was available from launch. Two trim levels, Turismo and Lusso were available, and the 147 was the first Alfa Romeo to have dual-zone climate control and electronic traction control. In production for ten years, the 147 was one of the oldest small family cars on sale in Europe at the time of its replacement, reaching a production figure of 651,823.
