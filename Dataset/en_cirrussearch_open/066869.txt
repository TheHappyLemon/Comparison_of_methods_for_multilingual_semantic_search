Artificial intelligence art is any visual artwork created through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) programs such as text-to-image models. Artists began to create AI art in the mid to late 20th century, when the discipline was founded. In the early 21st century, the availability of AI art tools to the general public increased, providing opportunities for use outside of academia and professional artists. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns, including those related to copyright, deception, and its impact on traditional artists, including their incomes.
