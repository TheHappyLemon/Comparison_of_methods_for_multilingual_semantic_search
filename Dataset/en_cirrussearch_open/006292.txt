Wig Wam is a Norwegian glam metal band formed in Halden in 2001. Wig Wam's lineup—consisting of vocalist Glam (Åge Sten Nilsen), guitarist Teeny (Trond Holter), bassist Flash (Bernt Jansen) and drummer Sporty (Øystein Andersen)—has remained unchanged since the band's formation. The band's style mixes glam metal and hard rock with humorous lyrics and imagery. Wig Wam had their international breakthrough in 2005 when they represented Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest held in Kyiv and placed ninth with the song "In My Dreams". Wig Wam split up in 2014, but reunited in 2019. The band enjoyed a resurgence in 2022 when James Gunn chose their song "Do Ya Wanna Taste It" as the opening theme for the HBO Max television series Peacemaker and featured "In My Dreams" on the soundtrack. Wig Wam has released six studio albums as of 2023. The band's slogan is: "Rock is the new schläger".
