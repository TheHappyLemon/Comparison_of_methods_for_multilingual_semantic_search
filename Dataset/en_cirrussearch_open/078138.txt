"The Hand That Feeds" is a song by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released as the lead single from their fourth studio album, With Teeth (2005). The single is the highest-charting Nine Inch Nails song on all charts except for Billboard Modern Rock Tracks, where it stayed at number one for five weeks (the following single "Only" stayed at number one for seven non-consecutive weeks), and the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 31. It is the band's only single to reach the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, as well as their highest-charting single on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, peaking at number two. It was also a crossover hit, crossing over to pop radio as their first top 40 radio hit since "Closer" in 1994 and "Hurt" in 1995, peaking at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In terms of overall chart performance, the song is beaten only by the group's 1999 song "The Day the World Went Away".
