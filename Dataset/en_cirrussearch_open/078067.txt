Rosenrot (German pronunciation: [ˈʁoːzn̩ˌʁoːt], "Rose-Red") is the fifth studio album by German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein, released on 28 October 2005. The album includes six songs artistically omitted from Reise, Reise. The album's first title was Reise, Reise Volume Two, but on 18 August 2005 the album was announced as Rosenrot. The cover art is nearly identical to the Japanese import of Reise, Reise. The image is a slightly altered photograph of the icebreaker USS Atka, taken on 13 March 1960 at McMurdo Station, Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica. While Rammstein did not actively promote the album, the band built anticipation through a variety of means. The first single from the album, "Benzin", premiered at the Berliner Wuhlheide and was subsequently released on disc. Rammstein's official website featured one-minute samples from six of the tracks, and had featured a prominent release-date countdown. A brief section of the chorus from "Rosenrot" plays in the background of an e-card containing photographs of the band and basic album information. As of February 2006, the album had shipped 1 million copies globally.
