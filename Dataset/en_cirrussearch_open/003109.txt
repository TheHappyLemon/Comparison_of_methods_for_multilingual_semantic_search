The Germany men's national basketball team (German: Deutsche Basketballnationalmannschaft or Die Mannschaft) represents Germany in international basketball competition. The team is directed by the German Basketball Federation (Deutscher Basketball Bund), the governing body for basketball in Germany. Currently, Germany is ranked third in the FIBA World Ranking. Between 1949 and 1990, separate German national teams were recognised by FIBA due to Allied occupation. The DBB were representing the Federal Republic of Germany (named West Germany from 1949 to 1990), while the East Germany team represented the German Democratic Republic (1952â€“1990). The two would later merge, after reunification in 1990. Germany's greatest achievements to date have been competing in 25 appearances at the EuroBasket, winning gold in 1993, silver in 2005, and bronze in 2022. Germany have made seven appearances at the FIBA World Cup, winning gold in 2023, and bronze in 2002. At the Olympic Games, in Germany's six appearances, their top performances are three quarter-final finishes (1984, 1992, 2020).
