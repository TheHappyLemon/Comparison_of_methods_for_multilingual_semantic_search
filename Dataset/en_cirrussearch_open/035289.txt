The I–V–vi–IV progression is a common chord progression popular across several genres of music. It uses the I, V, vi, and IV chords of a musical scale. For example, in the key of C major, this progression would be C–G–Am–F. Rotations include: I–V–vi–IV : C–G–Am–F V–vi–IV–I : G–Am–F–C vi–IV–I–V : Am–F–C–G IV–I–V–vi : F–C–G–Am The '50s progression uses the same chords but in a different order (I–vi–IV–V), no matter the starting point.
