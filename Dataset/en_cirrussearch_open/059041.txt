The 1975–76 season of the European Cup football club tournament was won for the third consecutive time by Bayern Munich in the final against Saint-Étienne at Hampden Park, Glasgow. This was the first time that Bayern Munich participated as last year's Cup winners only. It would be another 42 years before a club again won this tournament in three consecutive seasons, this being achieved by Real Madrid in 2018. Only Real Madrid, Ajax, and Bayern Munich won in three consecutive seasons.
