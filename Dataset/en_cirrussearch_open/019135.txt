Clube Náutico Capibaribe (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈklub ˈnawtʃiku kɐpibɐˈɾibi]), or simply Náutico, is a Brazilian multi-sport club based in Recife, Pernambuco. The club is most notable for its association football team, that plays in the Série C, the third tier of the Brazilian football league system, as well as in the Campeonato Pernambucano, the top division in the Pernambucano state football league system. The origins of Náutico may be traced to the foundation of the Clube Náutico do Recife by a group of rowers ("Náutico" can be directly translated to "nautical") in 1898, but the official founding date is April 7 of 1901. Its first football team dates back to 1905, with a squad formed by Englishmen and Germans. Náutico is the only football club in Pernambuco that has won the state championship 6 times in a row (from 1963 to 1968). The club has a historical rivalry with local clubs Sport Recife and Santa Cruz. Náutico has an important swimming arena, including an Olympic-sized pool that meets all world standards. It also has activities in other sports including hockey, basketball, volleyball, handball, women's football, futsal, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Boxing, Taekwondo, kendo, Muay Thai, MMA and the founding sport of the club, rowing. The official mascot of Náutico is the opossum, known locally as the "timbu". Náutico has the 6th-largest core of fans in the Northeastern region of Brazil, and occupies the 21st place in the overall Brazilian ranking. In total, there were approximately 1.5 million Náutico fans in 2010, as showed by a Lance magazine and IBOPE research.[citation needed]
