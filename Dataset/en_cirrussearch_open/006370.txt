Aphrodite is the eleventh studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. It was released on 30 June 2010 by Parlophone. In 2009, Minogue began working with British electronic music producer Stuart Price, who served as the executive producer of the album. The two collaborated with various producers and writers on the album, including Jake Shears, Calvin Harris, Sebastian Ingrosso and Pascal Gabriel. Aphrodite follows a musical approach similar to Minogue's previous albums and is primarily a dance-pop and disco-pop record. It draws influences from various dance-based genres including electropop, club and rave music. Aphrodite received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented it as a return to form for Minogue, however, some critics were divided on its production. In Australia, Aphrodite peaked at number two on the Australian Albums Chart and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, earning Minogue the Guinness World Record for achieving the most consecutive decades with top five albums in the country. Additionally, it reached the top five in Belgium, Canada, France, Greece, Spain, and, Switzerland, among others. Four singles were released from Aphrodite. The lead single, "All the Lovers", peaked at number three in the United Kingdom and reached the top 10 in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Subsequent singles "Get Outta My Way", "Better than Today", and "Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)" generally underperformed on the charts, causing Minogue to express disappointment in her label. In the United States, all four singles released from the album peaked atop the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. To further promote the album, Minogue embarked on the Aphrodite: Les Folies Tour in 2011.
