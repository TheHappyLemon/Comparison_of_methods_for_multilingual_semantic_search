The 2022 Laver Cup was the fifth edition of the Laver Cup, a men's tennis tournament between teams from Europe and the rest of the world. It was held on an indoor hard court at The O2 Arena in London, England from 23 until 25 September. This tournament marked the retirement from top-level tennis of 20-time singles major champion and former singles world No. 1, Roger Federer. The former champion partnered longtime rival Rafael Nadal in the opening doubles match, and was narrowly defeated in a third-set super tiebreak against Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe. Team World won the title for the first time.
