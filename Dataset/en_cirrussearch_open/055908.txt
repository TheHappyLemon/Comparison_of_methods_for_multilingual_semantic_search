Blaník (Czech: [blaɲiːk]) is a mountain in the Czech Republic near Louňovice pod Blaníkem. The hill and surrounding area is a protected landscape area. The Blaník massif consists of two forested rocky hills, Velký Blaník ("Great Blaník"; 638 m) and Malý Blaník (Small Blaník"; 580 m). The mountain has played an important role in Czech national mythology since the Middle Ages (together with the mountains Říp and Radhošť); therefore, during the era of the Czech National Revival, a stone quarried from Blaník was symbolically placed in the foundations of the newly built National Theatre in Prague.
