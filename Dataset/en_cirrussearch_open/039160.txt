The 1999 presidential elections in Latvia took place on June 17, 1999. After no candidate collected the required number of votes in several ballots, a break was announced at the election session, during which Raimonds Pauls, who had received the most support at the time, withdrew his candidacy. After the break, the sitting was resumed with new candidates and Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga was elected the 6th President of Latvia.
