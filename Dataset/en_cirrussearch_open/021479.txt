Galle is a small lunar impact crater on the Mare Frigoris, to the north-northeast of the prominent crater Aristoteles. The formation is nearly circular, with a sharp-edged rim and little appearance of erosion. There are slight outward bulges in the rim to the north and northeast, but otherwise the formation is relatively symmetrical.
