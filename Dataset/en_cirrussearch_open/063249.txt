Aegilops cylindrica, also known as jointed goatgrass, is an annual grass seed native to Southern Europe and Russia that is part of the tribe Triticeae, along with wheat and some other cereals. It is not native to North America, however it has become a serious issue as a weed since it was introduced in the late 19th century. Due to its relation to winter wheat, it is very difficult to control. Not only are the grains similar in shape and size to the seeds of winter wheat, making it difficult to remove through grain cleaning methods, the shared genetics mean that no registered herbicides are available to single out jointed goatgrass while leaving winter wheat unharmed. This poses problems for farmers who have to suffer through reduced yields and poorer quality winter wheat.
