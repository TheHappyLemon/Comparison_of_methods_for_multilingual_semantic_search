Třebíč (Czech pronunciation: [ˈtr̝̊ɛbiːtʃ] ; German: Trebitsch; Yiddish: טרייביטש Treybitsh) is a town in the Vysočina Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 35,000 inhabitants. The beginnings of the town's history are connected with the establishment of a Benedictine monastery, where the castle is located today. In the age of its expansion, Třebíč was the third most important town in Moravia. The population growth started after World War II. There are several well-known tourist sights in the town. The Jewish Quarter and St. Procopius Basilica were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003 because of their testimony to cultural interchange across several centuries and the remarkable architecture within the site. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.
