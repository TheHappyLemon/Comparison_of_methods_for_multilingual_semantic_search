The French Mandate from the League of Nations lasted from 1920 to 1946. The use of "Alawite", instead of "Nusayri", was advocated by the French early in the Mandate period and referred to a member of the Alawite religion. In 1920, the French-named "Alawite Territory" was home to a large population of Alawites.
