Natas (Satan spelled backwards) is a computer virus written by James Gentile, a then-18-year-old hacker from San Diego, California who went by the alias of "Little Loc" and later "Priest". The virus was made for a Mexican politician who wanted to win the Mexican elections by affecting all the Mexican Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) computers with a floppy disk.
