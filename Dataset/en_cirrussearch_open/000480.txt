Look up Schulz in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. Schulz is a common German and Jewish-Ashkenazi family name from Germany, particularly Northern Germany. The word Schulz originates from the local official title of Schulthei√ü or (Dorf-)Schulz(e), meaning village headman or constable/sheriff in the medieval sense (akin to today's office of mayor). In East Central Germany and Silesia, the "u" was often replaced by "o"; see also Scholz and Scholtz.
