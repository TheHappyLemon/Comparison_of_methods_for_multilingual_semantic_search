The Nokia 3410 is a mobile phone made by Nokia, the successor of the popular Nokia 3310. It was announced at CEBIT on 12 March 2002. The 3410 was the first Java phone by Nokia, as well as being one of the earliest mobile phones outside Japan to feature 3D graphics and an image editor. The Nokia 3410 was never released in the Asia-Pacific region, likely due to variants of the 3310[citation needed] such as the Nokia 3315, which featured almost the same design cues as the Nokia 3410, as well as Nokia observing tetraphobia in Asian markets where the number four is viewed as unlucky.
