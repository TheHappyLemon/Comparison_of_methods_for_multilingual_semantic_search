Wentian (simplified Chinese: 问天; traditional Chinese: 問天; pinyin: Wèn Tiān; lit. 'Quest for the Heavens'), officially the Wentian laboratory cabin module (simplified Chinese: 问天实验舱; traditional Chinese: 問天實驗艙), is a major module of the Tiangong space station. It was the first Laboratory Cabin Module launched, and the first module to extend the existing Tianhe core module of the station. It was launched into orbit from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on 24 July 2022, successfully docking with Tianhe forward port at 19:13 UTC on the same day. On 25 July 2022 at 02:03 UTC, the crew of Shenzhou 14 opened the hatch and entered the module for the first time. Wentian was later relocated to the starboard port on 30 September 2022 at 04:44 UTC by the indexing robot arm to make way for the Mengtian module
