The German Wikipedia (German: Deutschsprachige Wikipedia) is the German-language edition of Wikipedia, a free and publicly editable online encyclopedia. Founded on March 16, 2001, it is the second-oldest Wikipedia (after the English Wikipedia). It has 2,896,373 articles, making it the third-largest edition of Wikipedia by number of articles as of 2023[update] just behind the English Wikipedia and the mostly bot-generated Cebuano Wikipedia. It has the second-largest number of edits behind the English Wikipediaand over 260,000 disambiguation pages. On November 7, 2011 German Wikipedia became the second edition of Wikipedia, after the English edition, to exceed 100 million page edits. The German Wikipedia is criticized because of several ongoing political manipulations by paid editors who overwhelm a small number of administrators.
