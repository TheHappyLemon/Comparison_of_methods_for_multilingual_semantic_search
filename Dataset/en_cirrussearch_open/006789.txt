Bologna Football Club 1909, commonly referred to as Bologna (Italian pronunciation: [boˈloɲɲa]), is an Italian professional football club based in Bologna, Emilia-Romagna that plays in Serie A, the top flight of Italian football. The club have won seven top-flight titles, two Coppa Italia titles, and one UEFA Intertoto Cup. Founded in 1909, Bologna were founding members of Serie A (the First Division of Italian football) and won many of their league championships during the late 1930s. The club unfortunately lost their league dominance by 1964, when they won their last league title to date. They won their two Coppa Italia titles in the 1970s, before battling relegation throughout the latter part of the 20th century. Bologna changed ownership multiple times during the early 2000s and 2010s, due to financial mismanagement, and later stabilized under the guise of a Canadian consortium led by Joey Saputo. Since the 1st of January 2024, Bologna has a total market cap of €159.8M. Bologna have participated in 77 Serie A seasons, which is the ninth-most in Italian football history. The club have played in the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara since 1927, which is the tenth-largest stadium by capacity in Serie A.
