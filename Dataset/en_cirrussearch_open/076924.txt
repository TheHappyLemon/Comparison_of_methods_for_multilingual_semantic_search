A general officer is an officer of high rank in the armies, and in some nations' air forces, space forces, and marines or naval infantry. In some usages the term "general officer" refers to a rank above colonel. The adjective general had been affixed to officer designations since the late medieval period to indicate relative superiority or an extended jurisdiction.
