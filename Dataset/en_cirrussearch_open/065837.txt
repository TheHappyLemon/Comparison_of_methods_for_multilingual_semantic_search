The Hajar Mountains (Arabic: جِبَال ٱلْحَجَر, romanized: Jibāl al-Ḥajar, The Rocky Mountains or The Stone Mountains) are one of the highest mountain ranges in the Arabian Peninsula,[citation needed] shared between northern Oman and eastern United Arab Emirates. Also known as "Oman Mountains", they separate the low coastal plain of Oman from the high desert plateau, and lie 50–100 km (31–62 mi) inland from the Gulf of Oman. Al (اَلْ) means "the", and Ḥajar (حَجَر) means "stone" or "rock". So al-Ḥajar (اَلْحَجَر) is named as "the stone" or "the rock".
