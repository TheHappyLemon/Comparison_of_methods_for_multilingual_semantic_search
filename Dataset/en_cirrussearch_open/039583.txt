Siphunculina is a genus of small flies known as tropical eye flies. They are known for their habit of visiting the eyes of humans and other vertebrates to feed on fluids and in doing so cause annoyance, spread bacterial or viral diseases or cause injury to the eye. They have a habit of resting in large numbers on suspended strings, ropes and cobwebs. Several species are known from the Old World, including Asia, Europe and Africa.
