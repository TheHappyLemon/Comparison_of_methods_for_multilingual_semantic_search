Serhii Sternenko (Ukrainian: Сергій Стерненко, born 20 March 1995) is a Ukrainian far-right social activist, lawyer, and YouTuber. As of 2023, his YouTube channel has over 1.5 million subscribers. He is the head of the non-government organization Nebayduzhi (Ukrainian: Небайдужі), one of the founders of the People's Lustration, and a former board member and head of the Odesa regional branch of Right Sector, a coalition of Right-wing groups that includes ultranationalist and neo-nazi elements. He was an active participant in the Revolution of Dignity, including the 2014 Odesa clashes. Sternenko was the target of three assassination attempts. In 2018, he became visible in the media after the third attempt. It is believed that the "manhunt" was organized by supporters of pro-Russian groups and their sympathizers. During the incident, one of the two attackers died and the second fled abroad. As a result, Sternenko has been accused of exceeding the limits of self-defence. The police formally charged him with premeditated murder and possession of weapons without permit. However, Andrii Radionov, the senior prosecutor in the case, refused to sign the charges, claiming that the case and the evidence in the case are biased and do not comply with the legislation of Ukraine. The case against Sternenko received considerable media attention and prompted hundreds of activists to gather near the court building in support of Sternenko. Hundreds of security officers were called upon to restrain the people.
