Shane Albert Doan (born October 10, 1976) is a Canadian ice hockey executive and former player currently serving as an assistant to Brad Treliving for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). Doan spent the entirety of his 21-season NHL career with the Coyotes franchise, beginning with the original Winnipeg Jets in 1995 before playing in Arizona for two decades. He was the last remaining player active in the NHL from the original Winnipeg Jets franchise before he announced his retirement in the summer of 2017. Doan led the Phoenix Coyotes in scoring in every season between 2003 and 2011. In December 2015, Doan became the Coyotes franchise's all-time leading goal scorer. He was also the longest-serving NHL captain until his retirement, serving in that capacity for the Coyotes from 2003 to 2017. Doan never won the Stanley Cup, coming closest when his Phoenix Coyotes lost to the Los Angeles Kings in the 2012 Western Conference Final. In international competition, Doan represented Canada and won five medals (two gold, three silver) at the World Championships. He helped Canada win the World Cup championship in 2004 and was also a member of Canada's 2006 Winter Olympic team. The Coyotes retired Doan's jersey number prior to a game against the current Winnipeg Jets on February 24, 2019. He subsequently joined the Coyotes front office on January 11, 2021.
