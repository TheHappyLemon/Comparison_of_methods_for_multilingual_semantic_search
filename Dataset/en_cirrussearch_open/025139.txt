Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP) was a Finnish commercial bank operating from 1889 to 1995. It was created by the fennoman movement as a Finnish language alternative to the largely Swedish language bank, Suomen Yhdyspankki (Swedish: FÃ¶reningsbanken i Finland). The two banks were merged in 1995 to form the Merita Bank. Merita Bank was later merged with Swedish Nordbanken to form Nordea.
