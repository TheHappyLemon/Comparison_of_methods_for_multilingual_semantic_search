Boris Borisovich Yegorov (Russian: Бори́с Бори́сович Его́ров, November 26, 1937 – September 12, 1994) was a Soviet physician and cosmonaut who became the first medical doctor to travel to space. He was born in Moscow, Soviet Union (now Russia) and received his medical degree from the Moscow Medical Institute in 1961. Yegorov earned his doctorate in medicine, with his specialization being in disorders of the sense of balance. Yegorov was selected as a member of the multi-disciplinary team that flew on Voskhod 1. It has been suggested that his father's influence within the Politburo may have had some bearing on the selection. As a result of this space flight, Yegorov was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union on October 19, 1964. He died from a heart attack in 1994.
