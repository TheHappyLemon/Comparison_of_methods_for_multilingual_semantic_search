Tolyatti (Russian: Тольятти, IPA: [tɐlʲˈjætʲ(ː)ɪ]), also known as Togliatti, formerly known as Stavropol (1737–1964), is a city in Samara Oblast, Russia. It is the largest city in Russia which is neither the administrative center of a federal subject, nor the largest city of a subject. Population: 684,709 (2021 Census); 719,632 (2010 Census); 702,879 (2002 Census); 630,543 (1989 Census). The city is best known as the home of Russia's largest car manufacturer AvtoVAZ (Lada). It was renamed after Italian communist politician Palmiro Togliatti in 1964. For this reason, Tolyatti is often dubbed "Russia's motor city" or "Russia's Motown" (in reference to Detroit in the United States—the spiritual home of the American automotive industry).
