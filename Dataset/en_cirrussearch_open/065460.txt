Sumbawa (Sumbawa: Semawa) is an Indonesian island, located in the middle of the Lesser Sunda Islands chain, with Lombok to the west, Flores to the east, and Sumba further to the southeast. Along with Lombok, it forms the province of West Nusa Tenggara, but there have been plans (currently held in abeyance) by the Indonesian government to split the island off into a separate province. Traditionally, the island is known as the source of sappanwood, as well as honey and sandalwood. Its savanna-like climate and vast grasslands are used to breed horses and cattle, as well as to hunt deer. Sumbawa has an area (including minor offshore islands) of 15,323.77 square kilometres or 5,916.54 square miles (three times the size of Lombok) with a population (at the 2020 Census) of 1,561,461; the official estimate as at mid-2023 was 1,626,517. It marks the boundary between the islands to the west, which were influenced by religion and culture spreading from India, and the region to the east which was less influenced. In particular, this applies to both Hinduism and Islam.
