It is native to parts of Eastern Europe and Russia, all of Siberia, Mongolia, and northern China, and has been introduced to Czechoslovakia. A number of authorities consider it to be a subspecies of the spiked speedwell Veronica spicata; Veronica spicata subsp. incana. It is a parent of the hybrids Veronica × czemalensis (with V. porphyriana) and Veronica × grisea (with V. longifolia).
