The International University Sports Federation (FISU; French: Fédération internationale du sport universitaire) is responsible for the organization and governance of worldwide sports competitions for student-athletes between the ages of 17 and 25. It was founded in 1949 as the world governing body of national university sports organizations and currently has 165 member associations (National University Sport Federations) from five continents. Between 1949 and 2011, it was based in Brussels (Belgium); it was relocated to Lausanne (Switzerland) since 2011. The FISU stages its events every two years. They currently include three World University Games (beach,summer and winter) and 34 World University Championships. It also organizes conferences, forums and seminars to promote sport as a component of the educational system. FISU sanctions other competitions open to university students, such as the biennial World University Bridge Championships in contract bridge, "played under the auspices of the FISU".
