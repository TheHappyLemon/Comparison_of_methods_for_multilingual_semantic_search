Guernica (/ɡɜːrˈniːkə, ˈɡɜːrnɪkə/, Spanish pronunciation: [ɡeɾˈnika]), officially Gernika (pronounced [ɡernika]) in Basque, is a town in the province of Biscay, in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, Spain. The town of Guernica is one part (along with neighbouring Lumo) of the municipality of Gernika-Lumo (Spanish: Guernica y Luno), whose population is 16,224 as of 2009[update]. On April 26, 1937, Guernica was bombed by Nazi Germany's Condor Legion, in one of the first aerial bombings. The attack inspired Pablo Picasso's painting Guernica, depicting his outrage at the attack.
