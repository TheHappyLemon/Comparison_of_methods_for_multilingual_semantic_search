For data storage, identification is the capability to find, retrieve, report, change, or delete specific data without ambiguity. For example, tracking numbers for products, user Ferdinand Icatlo, and similar stored in databases. In database normalisation, the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency, is the central, defining function of the discipline.
