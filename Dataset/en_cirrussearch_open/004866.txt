Cyanopica is a genus of magpie in the family Corvidae. They belong to a common lineage with the genus Perisoreus. The genus Cyanopica was introduced in 1850 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The type species was designated by George Gray in 1855 as Corvus cyanus Pallas, 1766, the azure-winged magpie. The generic name is derived from the Latin words cyanos, meaning "lapis lazuli", and pica, meaning "magpie".
