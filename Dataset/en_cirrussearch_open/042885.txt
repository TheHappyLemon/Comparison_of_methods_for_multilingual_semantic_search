Hackman was a cutlery and cookware company founded in Finland in 1790. The Hackman brand is now owned by Iittala Group, which was acquired by Fiskars Corporation in 2007. In a 2008 survey which included both Finnish and international brands, it was the fifth most respected brand among consumers. The Hackman butterfly knife (Finnish: Linkkupuukko, "latch-knife") was a type of butterfly knife produced by Hackman. The knife was marketed by Hackman as a retkiveitsi ("camping knife") and later as Er√§puukko ("wilderness puukko"). The knives were also sold in the United States, and some researchers state they were issued by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency during the Vietnam War.
