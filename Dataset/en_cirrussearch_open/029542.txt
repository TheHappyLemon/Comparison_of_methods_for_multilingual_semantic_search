Scandinavian Airlines, more commonly known and styled as SAS, is the flag carrier of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. SAS is an abbreviation of the company's full name, Scandinavian Airlines System or legally Scandinavian Airlines System Denmark-Norway-Sweden. Part of the SAS Group and headquartered at the SAS Frösundavik Office Building in Solna, Sweden, the airline operates 180 aircraft to 90 destinations (as of December 2019). The airline's main hub is at Copenhagen-Kastrup Airport, with connections to 109 destinations around the world. Stockholm Arlanda Airport (with 106 destinations) is the second largest hub, with Oslo Airport, Gardermoen being the third major hub of SAS. Minor hubs also exist at Bergen Airport, Flesland, Göteborg Landvetter Airport, Stavanger Airport, and Trondheim Airport. SAS Cargo is an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of Scandinavian Airlines and its main office is at Copenhagen Airport. In 2017, SAS carried 28.6 million passengers, achieving revenues of 40 billion Swedish kronor. This makes it the eighth-largest airline in Europe and the largest in Denmark and Sweden. The SAS fleet is composed of 124 aircraft consisting of Airbus A319, Airbus A320, Airbus A320neo, Airbus A321LR, Airbus A330, Airbus A350 and Embraer 195 aircraft. SAS also wet leases Airbus A320neo, ATR 72, and Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft. The airline was founded in 1946 as a consortium to pool the transatlantic operations of Swedish airline Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik, Norway's Det Norske Luftfartselskap and Det Danske Luftfartselskab of Denmark. The consortium was extended to cover European and domestic cooperation two years later. In 1951, all the airlines were merged to create SAS. SAS has been described as "an icon of Norwegian–Swedish–Danish cooperation". In 1997, SAS co-founded Star Alliance, the first of the three major airline alliances, alongside United Airlines, Air Canada, Lufthansa and Thai Airways International. On 27 June 2018, the Norwegian government announced that it had sold all its shares in SAS. In October 2023, it was announced that Air France–KLM, the Danish government and two financial firms would be investing in SAS, with Air France–KLM taking a 19.9% stake. If approved by regulators, SAS would leave Star Alliance and join SkyTeam.
