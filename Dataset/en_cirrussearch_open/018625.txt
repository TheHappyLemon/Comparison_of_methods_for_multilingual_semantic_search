Bellingshausen Station (Russian: станция Беллинсгаузен) is a Russian (formerly Soviet) Antarctic station at Collins Harbour, on King George Island of the South Shetland Islands. It was one of the first research stations founded by the Soviet Antarctic Expedition in 1968. It is also the location of Trinity Church, the only permanently staffed Eastern Orthodox church in Antarctica. The station is named for the 19th-century Russian explorer of the Antarctic Fabian von Bellingshausen. The station is connected by unimproved roads to the nearby stations: Chilean Base Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva, Chinese Great Wall Station, and Uruguayan Artigas Base. It is antipodal to a location in Russian Siberia, ~400 km west from Yakutsk. In October 2018, it was the site of the first attempted murder in Antarctica.
