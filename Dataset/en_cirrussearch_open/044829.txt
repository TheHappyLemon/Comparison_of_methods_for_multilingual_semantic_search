Ben 10: Omniverse is an American animated television series and the fourth installment of the Ben 10 franchise (and the final series in the original continuity), which aired on Cartoon Network from September 22, 2012, to November 14, 2014, in the United States, across eight 10-episode serialised "story arcs" instead of a season-based episode release structure. Man of Action Studios, consisting of Duncan Rouleau, Joe Casey, Joe Kelly, and Steven T. Seagle, created the franchise. The series was announced at Cartoon Network's Upfront in 2011. Concept art, described as a homage to the original Ben 10 series, designed by Derrick J. Wyatt (Transformers: Animated and Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated) was first unveiled at the 2012 UK Toy Fair. The series premiered on September 22, 2012, with a "sneak peek episode" that aired on August 1, 2012. A "sneak peek" of the series aired after "Ben 10 Week" (March 19, 2012 – March 24, 2012). The show was followed by a reboot of the franchise in 2016.
