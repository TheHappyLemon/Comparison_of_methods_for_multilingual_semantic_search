Salacgrīva fortress was a medieval castle located on the right bank of the Salaca river, in the historical region of Vidzeme, northern Latvia. Built in 1226 by the bishopric of Riga, it served as an outpost to control access to the port of Salaca. It was heavily damaged by Russian, Tartars, Polish and the Swedish troops during the Northern Wars. The word 'Salacgrīva' means 'Mouth (estuary) of Salaca'.
