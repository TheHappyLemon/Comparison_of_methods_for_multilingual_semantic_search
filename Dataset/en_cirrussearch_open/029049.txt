S.C. Automobile Dacia S.A., commonly known as Dacia (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈdatʃi.a] ), is a Romanian car manufacturer that takes its name from the historical region that constitutes present-day Romania. The company was established in 1966. In 1999, after 33 years, the Romanian government sold Dacia to the French car manufacturer Groupe Renault. It is Romania's largest company by revenue and the largest exporter, constituting 8% of the country's total exports in 2018. In 2021, the Dacia marque sold 537,074 passenger and commercial vehicles. From January 2021 onwards the Dacia company became part of Renault's Dacia-Lada business unit. In May 2022, Renault sold Lada's parent company AvtoVAZ to Russian state-owned institute NAMI.
