"Cliffs of Dover" is an original instrumental rock composition by American guitarist, singer and songwriter Eric Johnson. It was released on his 1990 studio album Ah Via Musicom. The song had frequently been played live by Johnson as early as 1984. The album version of the song is composed in the key of G major. The song was played with a Gibson ES-335 (as well as a Fender Stratocaster) through a B. K. Butler Tube Driver and an Echoplex plugged into a 100-watt Marshall amplifier. The song takes its name from the White Cliffs of Dover, an extensive and visually stunning chalk outcrop that runs along the southeast coast of England. It is also featured on the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and is available as DLC for the game Rocksmith 2014.
