It was one of two Formula One constructors owned by Austrian conglomerate company Red Bull, the other being Red Bull Racing. Toro Rosso functioned as a junior team to Red Bull Racing, with the aim of developing the skills of promising drivers for the senior team. The constructor made its racing début in the 2006 season, moving to complete independence from its sister team in 2010. The team changed its name to Scuderia AlphaTauri in 2020 to promote parent company Red Bull's fashion label of the same name. The team was established after Paul Stoddart sold his remaining interest in the Minardi team at the end of 2005 to Red Bull's owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, and Minardi was renamed Toro Rosso. Mateschitz subsequently struck a 50/50 joint-ownership deal with former Formula One driver Gerhard Berger before the start of the season. In late November 2008, Red Bull regained total ownership of Toro Rosso after buying back Berger's share of the team. From 2007 to 2013, Toro Rosso used Ferrari V8 engines, taking over the contract that their senior team broke from at the end of 2006 to switch engine builders to Renault. For 2014, Toro Rosso switching to Renault engines as well, but in 2016 returned to using Ferrari power. However, they switched back to Renault in 2017 (albeit under 'Toro Rosso' branding), then in 2018 to Honda. The team principal was Franz Tost, formerly of BMW's motor sport division. Vitantonio Liuzzi scored the team's first point in its first season at the 2006 United States Grand Prix. The team's first podium and only pole position and victory were scored by Sebastian Vettel at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. Max Verstappen became the youngest driver to compete in Formula One, at 17 years and 166 days old, in a Toro Rosso at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix.
