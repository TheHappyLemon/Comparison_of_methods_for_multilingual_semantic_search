Lake Tuz (Turkish: Tuz Gölü meaning 'Salt Lake'; anciently Tatta — Ancient Greek: Τάττα, Latin: Tatta Lacus) was the second largest lake in Turkey with its 1,665 km2 (643 sq mi) surface area and one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world. It is located in the Central Anatolia Region, 105 km (65 mi) northeast of Konya, 150 km (93 mi) south-southeast of Ankara and 57 km (35 mi) northwest of Aksaray. In recent years, Lake Tuz has become a hotspot for tourists. In October 2021, Lake Tuz dried up completely.
