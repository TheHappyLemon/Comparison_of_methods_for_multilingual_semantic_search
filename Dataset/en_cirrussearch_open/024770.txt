Berezhany Raion (Ukrainian: Бережанський район) was a raion (district) in the westernmost corner of Ternopil Oblast (province) in western Ukraine, area traditionally known as Halychyna (Galicia). The administrative center was the city of Berezhany, some 50 kilometres (31 mi) away from Ternopil and 80 kilometres (50 mi) away from Lviv. Berezhany was separately incorporated as a city of oblast significance and did not belong to the raion. The Zolota Lypa river, a tributary of the Dniester tributary crossed the district from the north to the south. The river forms a large lake north of Berezhany. The raion was abolished on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ternopil Oblast to three. The area of Berezhany Raion was merged into Ternopil Raion. The last estimate of the raion population was 20,453 (2020 est.). The area of the raion was 661 cubic kilometres (159 cu mi). There were 54 villages and 1 town (Berezhany) in the raion. At the time of disestablishment, the raion consisted of three hromadas: Berezhany urban hromada with the administration in Berezhany, also included Berezhany Municipality; Naraiv rural hromada with the administration in the selo of Naraiv; Saranchuky rural hromada with the administration in the selo of Saranchuky.
