Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel is the twelfth studio album by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It was released on September 29, 2009, by Island Records. After promotion for her previous album, E=MCÂ² (2008) ended, Carey began to work on a new album, producing songs with Terius "The-Dream" Nash and Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, and revealed the album's title through Twitter. Carey said that Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel would have "big ballads", and that "each song is its own snapshot of a moment in a story". Five singles were released to promote the album. The lead single, "Obsessed", became the album's most successful song, peaking at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top twenty in Japan, Canada and Australia and the top ten in Italy and France. The second single, "I Want to Know What Love Is", reached number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped the Brasil Hot 100 Airplay chart for twenty-seven non-consecutive weeks. Other singles released were "H.A.T.E.U.", "Up Out My Face", and "Angels Cry", with the last two being originally intended for the subsequently-cancelled remix album, Angels Advocate. "It's a Wrap" was released as the album's sixth single in 2023 after going viral on video sharing platform TikTok. Upon its release, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel received positive reviews from music critics. They felt that "their team-up with Carey is canny; Stewart and Nash loosen up the diva's sometimes overblown on-record persona", and also "one of her most sonically consistent". Commercially, the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 with 168,000 copies sold in its first week, and peaked within the top-ten in other five countries. To promote the album, Carey made a pre-show in Madison Square Garden in 2009, embarked on the Angels Advocate Tour (2010), and performed on several television programs, including America's Got Talent, The Oprah Winfrey Show and Today.
