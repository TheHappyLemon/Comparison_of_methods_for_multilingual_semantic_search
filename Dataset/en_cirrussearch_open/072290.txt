In the human brain, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is the frontal part of the cingulate cortex that resembles a "collar" surrounding the frontal part of the corpus callosum. It consists of Brodmann areas 24, 32, and 33. It is involved in certain higher-level functions, such as attention allocation, reward anticipation, decision-making, impulse control (e.g. performance monitoring and error detection), and emotion.
