Tvøroyrar Bóltfelag is a Faroese professional football club from Tvøroyri, currently playing in the Betrideildin, the top tier of Faroese football. TB Tvøroyri is the oldest football club in the Faroe Islands, and also one of the oldest in the Danish Realm, in which the Faroe Islands are a self-governing country. After the end of the 2016 season, it was decided on 15 December 2016 that the three clubs of the island Suðuroy, which are TB Tvøroyri, FC Suðuroy and Royn Hvalba would merge into a new club for the 2017 season. The merger will not be complete until 2018 and the name will be all three names together for the 2017 season: TB/FC Suðuroy/Royn. The three clubs have not been dissolved yet, they continue separately for the children's and women's teams. In 2017 it will only be the men's teams which will play for the new cooperation. In Faroese the new team is referred to as Suðuroyarliðið (the Suðuroy-team). The first head coach for the Suðuroy-team is the Scottish manager Maurice Ross. After two years the three clubs ended the co-operation and TB Tvøroyri continued to play with their licence which was for the Faroese Premier League. In 2020 TB became a member of the Club of Pioneers, a network of oldest football clubs.
