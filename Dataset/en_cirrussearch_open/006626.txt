The President of Chile (Spanish: Presidente de Chile), officially known as the President of the Republic of Chile (Spanish: Presidente de la Rep√∫blica de Chile), is the head of state and head of government of the Republic of Chile. The president is responsible for both government administration and state administration. Although its role and significance have changed over time, and its position and relations with other actors in the national political organization have also evolved, it remains one of the most prominent political offices in the country. It is also considered one of the key institutions that form the "Historic Constitution of Chile," and is crucial to the country's political stability. Under the current Constitution, adopted in 1980, the president serves a four-year term and is not eligible for immediate re-election. The shorter term (previously it was six years) allows for synchronized parliamentary and presidential elections. The president's official seat is the La Moneda Palace in the capital Santiago. Michelle Bachelet was the first female president of Chile and served from 2006 to 2010 and from 2014 to 2018. Since 2022, Gabriel Boric is the current president, having won the 2021 Chilean general election and taking office on 11 March 2022.
