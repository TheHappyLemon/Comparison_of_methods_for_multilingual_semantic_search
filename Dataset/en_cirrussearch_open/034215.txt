The 2016 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2015–16 season and conclusion of the 2016 playoffs. The Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the defending NBA champion and Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors four games to three in a rematch of the previous year's Finals. It was the 14th rematch of the previous NBA Finals in history, and the second straight rematch in back-to-back years, as the Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs played each other in 2013 and 2014. The series was played from June 2 to 19. The win gave the Cavaliers their first NBA championship, ending the Cleveland sports curse. They became the first team in NBA history to overcome a 3–1 deficit in the Finals and the fourth team to win the series after losing the first two games. This also marked the first time since 1978 that Game 7 was won by the road team and as of 2023, this is the most recent NBA Finals to feature a Game 7. Because of Cleveland's comeback, these Finals are widely regarded as among the greatest in NBA history. LeBron James was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP), receiving all 11 Finals MVP votes, and was also the first player in NBA history to lead all players in a playoff series in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. His stellar performance in the series, which included a clutch block in Game 7 on Andre Iguodala, helped it become known as one of the greatest NBA Finals of all time.
