Strømsgodset Toppfotball is a Norwegian professional football club based in Gulskogen, Drammen, that competes in the Eliteserien. It is the elite football section of the multi-sports club Strømsgodset IF. The multi-sports club was founded 10 February 1907, but the football team first found success in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Led by the young striker Steinar Pettersen and his team-mates, the «Rødgata Boys» (nicknamed after the street most of them lived on), Strømsgodset got promoted from the fourth tier to the top flight in just a few years. The team then went on to win the top division in 1970 and the Norwegian Cup in 1969, 1970, 1973. In the following decades, the club struggled more. However, the relegation to the third tier in 1986 was a turning point for the football team, and the club was promoted to the top flight again in 1989. In 1991, the club secured its fourth Norwegian Cup, and a turbulent decade followed, with promotions and relegations. In 1997 they lost the cup final, but secured bronze medals in the league. After five years in the second tier, the economic situation had become a problem for the club, almost bringing it to bankruptcy in 2005. However, local investors saved the club, and this was the start of the second successful period. The club was promoted to Tippeligaen, won the Norwegian cup in 2010, and gradually grew into one of the best teams in Norway. A 2nd place in 2012 was followed by another championship in 2013, the club's second league title.
