Det NÃ¸dvendige Seminarium (DNS) (English: The Necessary Teacher Training College) is a private international college located in Denmark. DNS offers a four-year programme in alternative pedagogy, combining theoretical studies and practical experiences. The students enrolled in DNS also enrol in a distance learning programme offered by ISET - One World, a Teacher Training institution based in Mozambique, from which they receive their licentiate in Pedagogy. The licentiate is equivalent to a bachelor's degree,[citation needed] although it is not clear to what extent it is accepted in Europe. DNS was founded in Denmark in 1972 and has since educated hundreds of teachers now working all over the world in positions related to alternative education for children, youngsters and adults. The institution is located in the Central Jutland, in the controversial Tvind School Center. Today, the Tvind campus is an alternative community, comprising different institutions, such as small care homes for youngsters and adults with special needs, and a wind energy farm, the Tvindkraft. Every year, Tvind and DNS host and organise different educational events, such as sports events for schools, concerts of classical music, pedagogical workshops and camps, and a yearly Peace Justice Conference. The institution is private, and the programme alternates periods of studies with periods of work to allow the students to self-finance their education. The working periods are referred to as "saving up periods", and are facilitated by DNS - often collaborating with partnering pedagogical institutions within the framework of the college.
