Tijana Bošković (Serbian Cyrillic: Тијана Бошковић; born 8 March 1997) is a Serbian professional volleyball player. She has won gold medals with the Serbia women's national volleyball team at the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, and the 2017 and 2019 European Championships. She is also a two-time Olympic medalist, having won silver at the 2016 Rio Games and bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Games. Bošković is left-handed and has been one of Serbia's key players ever since her debut with the national team in 2014. By the age of 21, she had already played in gold medal matches in all major tournaments (Olympic Games, World Championship, and European Championship), and she was one of the players who contributed a lot of winning points for Serbia. Bošković's record in major championships is nothing short of phenomenal – 10 majors played, reaching the semifinals 9 times and making it to the finals 7 times. So far, she has never missed standing on the podium in every major she has played, except for her debut year at the 2014 World Championship. Being selected for the 2019 European Volleyball Confederation Female Volleyball Player of the Year award, Bošković has recorded an impressive achievement by receiving that award for three consecutive years (2017, 2018, 2019). Bošković became the first woman to spike and serve at a speed exceeding 110 km/h. During the Eczacıbaşı Dynavit–Imoco Volley Conegliano match at the 2022 FIVB Club World Championship, Bošković broke the women's world record for the fastest serve at a lightning speed of 111.4 km/h. Not stopping there, she also smashed her own record for spike speed by hitting the ball at an incredible 110.9 km/h in the same game. This puts her as the second-fastest spiker in women's volleyball history, sharing the spot with Annie Drews, just behind Paola Egonu.
