"Untouchable (Swizz Beatz Remix)" is a song by rapper Tupac Shakur. The song was released as a remix by Swizz Beatz and Krayzie Bone and was used to promote the 2006 posthumous album Pac's Life. Tupac recorded the song in June, 1996, just prior to the Makaveli recording sessions.[citation needed] The original version has never been officially released. In the Swizz Beatz remix, rapper Krayzie Bone replaces the original featured artists, recording his part sometime in 2005. As the song was released as a promotional single only, no official music video for the song was created. The song contains lyrics similar to other Tupac songs, such as "Killuminati", "Untouchable (Freestyle Version)" and "Capture The Flag".
