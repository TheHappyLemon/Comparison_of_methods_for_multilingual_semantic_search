The Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 was sparked by the Greek War of Independence of 1821–1829. War broke out after the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II closed the Dardanelles to Russian ships and revoked the 1826 Akkerman Convention in retaliation for Russian participation in the Battle of Navarino. After several defeats, the Sultan decided to sue for peace, leading to the Treaty of Adrianople being signed on 14 September 1829.
