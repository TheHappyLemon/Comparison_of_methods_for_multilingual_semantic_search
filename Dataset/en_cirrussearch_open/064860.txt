Crepis paludosa, the marsh hawk's-beard, is a European species of flowering plant in the tribe Cichorieae of the family Asteraceae. It is widespread across much of Europe with isolated populations in Iceland, the Ural Mountains, and the Caucasus. This herbaceous perennial is found beside shady streams and in other damp shady places. The inflorescence is around 15–25 millimetres (0.6–1.0 in) in diameter. The upper leaves clasp the stem with pair of rounded basal lobes. It is a much more robust plant than smooth hawksbeard, Crepis capillaris, with which it is sometimes confused.[citation needed] The Flower heads are yellow and the flower buds are covered with black gland-hairs.
