"I Don't Need a Man" is a song recorded by American girl group the Pussycat Dolls for their debut studio album PCD (2005). It was written and produced by Rich Harrison, with additional writing from Nicole Scherzinger, Kara DioGuardi, and Vanessa Brown. The song was released as the fifth single from the album on September 9, 2006, by A&M Records and Interscope Records. Musically, it draws from 1980s music and includes elements of dance, pop, and R&B. Inspired by Destiny's Child's "Independent Women Part I" (2000), the song is a post-disco that feautures feminist themes and rejects objectification and co-dependency, while part of the chorus alludes to masturbation. It has been compared to works by Beyonc√©, Inner City, and Meghan Trainor. "I Don't Need a Man" was met with a warm reception from music critics for its catchiness, themes, and sound. Over the years, the song has appeared on lists of the best feminist songs and best songs about masturbation by various publications. Commercially, it gave the Pussycat Dolls fifth consecutive top-ten single in Australia, Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The music video, directed by Chris Applebaum, showcases the group's "female ways" and is compared to the film, Grease (1978) by member Ashley Roberts. It received a nomination for Sexiest Video at the 2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards.
