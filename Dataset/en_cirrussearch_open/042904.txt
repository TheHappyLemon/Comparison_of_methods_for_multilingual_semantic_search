The Yas Marina Circuit (Arabic: حلبة مرسى ياس) is the venue for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The circuit was designed by Hermann Tilke, and is situated on Yas Island, near Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. Yas Marina was the second of four Formula One tracks in the Middle East, with the first being in Bahrain and subsequent tracks in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. A two-day GP2 Asia Series test was held to officially open the circuit, which was held a week before the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. It also hosted V8 Supercars between 2010 and 2012, with the event being the opening round in 2010 and 2011. Outside motorsport, the circuit was used for the final stage of the inaugural Abu Dhabi Tour cycle race in 2015. The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 license.
