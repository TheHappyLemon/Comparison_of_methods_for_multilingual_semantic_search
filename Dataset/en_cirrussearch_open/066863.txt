The Rada of the Belarusian National Republic (Belarusian: Рада Беларускай Народнай Рэспублікі, romanized: Rada Biełaruskaj Narodnaj Respubliki, Рада БНР, Rada BNR) was the governing body of the Belarusian Democratic Republic. Since 1919, the Rada BNR has been in exile where it has preserved its existence among the Belarusian diaspora as an advocacy group promoting support to Belarusian independence and democracy in Belarus among Western policymakers. As of 2024[update], the Rada BNR is the oldest existing government in exile.
