In chemistry, iron(II) refers to the element iron in its +2 oxidation state. The adjective ferrous or the prefix ferro- is often used to specify such compounds, as in ferrous chloride for iron(II) chloride (FeCl2). The adjective ferric is used instead for iron(III) salts, containing the cation Fe3+. The word ferrous is derived from the Latin word ferrum, meaning "iron". In ionic compounds (salts), such an atom may occur as a separate cation (positive ion) abbreviated as Fe2+, although more precise descriptions include other ligands such as water and halides. Iron(III) centres occur in coordination complexes, such as in the anion ferrocyanide, [Fe(CN)6]4âˆ’, where six cyanide ligands are bound the metal centre; or, in organometallic compounds, such as the ferrocene [Fe(C2H5)2], where two cyclopentadienyl anions are bound to the FeII centre.
