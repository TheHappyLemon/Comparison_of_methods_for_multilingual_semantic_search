The Socialist International (SI) is a political international or worldwide organisation of political parties which seek to establish democratic socialism. Though it consists mostly of social-democratic political parties and labour organisations. Although formed in 1951 as a successor to the Labour and Socialist International, it has antecedents in the late 19th century. The organisation currently includes 132 member parties and organisations from over 100 countries. Its members have governed in many countries, including most of Europe. In 2013, a schism in the SI led to the establishment of the Progressive Alliance. The current secretary general of the SI is Benedicta Lasi of Ghana and the current president of the SI is the prime minister of Spain, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, both of whom were elected at the last SI Congress held in Madrid, Spain, in November 2022.
