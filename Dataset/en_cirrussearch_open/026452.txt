The Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision (Rostekhnadzor; Russian: Федеральная служба по экологическому, технологическому и атомному надзору (Ростехнадзор)) is the supervisory body of the Government of Russia on ecological, technological, and nuclear issues. Its functions include the passage of regulatory legal acts, supervision and oversight in the field of environmental protection, limiting harmful technogenic impact (including the handling of industrial and consumer waste), safety when working with the subsoil (e.g., mining), protection of the subsoil, industrial safety, atomic energy safety (not including the development, preparation, testing, operation and use of nuclear weapons and military atomic facilities), the safety of electrical and thermal facilities and networks (except for household facilities and networks), the safety of hydraulic structures at industrial and energy sites; the safety of manufacturing, storage, and use of industrial explosives, and special state security functions in these areas. Russian Government Resolution № 404 of 29 May 2008 transferred Rostekhnadzor to the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment; previously, the service had been directly subordinate to the government. However, this was reversed by President Dmitry Medvedev on 23 June 2010, when he brought it back under the direct control of the government. In accordance with RF Government Resolution No. 54 of 1 February 2006, Rostekhnadzor was entrusted with oversight of the construction industry.
