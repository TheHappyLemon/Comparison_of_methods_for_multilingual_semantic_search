Arch Linux (/ɑːrtʃ/) is an independently developed x86-64 general-purpose Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is intentionally minimal so that users can add only the packages they require. Pacman, a package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, is used to install, remove and update software packages. Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, meaning it has no major releases. An Arch Linux installation is kept up-to-date by regularly updating the individual pieces of software that it comprises. The only "releases" are up-to-date snapshots of main system components released monthly. Arch Linux has comprehensive documentation in the form of a community-run wiki known as the ArchWiki.
