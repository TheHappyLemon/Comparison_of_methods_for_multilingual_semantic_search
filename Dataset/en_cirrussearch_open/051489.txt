The boxing tournaments at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo took place from 24 July to 8 August 2021 at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan. Thirteen events were staged, the same number as in London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016. However, for the first time since the London Games, the programme has been updated, with the number of men's events reduced by two and the number of women's events increased by the same number. On 22 May 2019, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that the International Boxing Association (AIBA) had been stripped of the right to organise the tournament, due to "issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics and refereeing and judging". Boxing will instead be organised by an ad-hoc task force led by Morinari Watanabe, president of the International Gymnastics Federation.
