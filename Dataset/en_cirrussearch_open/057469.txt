Pravetz (Bulgarian: Правец) is a brand of personal computers produced in Bulgaria from 1979. They were widely used in scientific organizations and schools until the 1990s. Pravets were the first personal computers made in Bulgaria. Before that, various types of large computer systems were used, the size of rooms (60-70), as well as even lamp computers before that. The name of the Pravet computers specifies that these are personal computers "made" (in Bulgarian language: правя, pravja) in Bulgaria. They were manufactured in the town of Pravetz, with some components and software being produced in other towns as Sofia, Plovdiv, Stara Zagora and other Bulgarian cities. Pravetz computers are still in use in some schools for beginner students in computing because they are adapted in manufacturing for educational purposes. Bulgaria was the leading manufacturer, with its leading trademark Pravetz, of computer and peripherals electronics for the socialist economic union COMECON in 20th century.
