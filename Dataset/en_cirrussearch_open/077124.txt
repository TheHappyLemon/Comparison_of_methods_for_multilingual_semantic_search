See media help. "Tavisupleba" (Georgian: თავისუფლება, pronounced [tʰavisupʰleba]; "Freedom") is the national anthem of Georgia. It was adopted as the Georgian national anthem in May 2004, along with a new national flag and coat of arms. The symbols' change was brought about upon the successful overthrow of the previous government in the bloodless Rose Revolution. The music, taken from the Georgian operas Abesalom da Eteri ("Abesalom and Eteri") and Daisi ("The Nightfall"), by the Georgian composer Zacharia Paliashvili (Georgian: ზაქარია ფალიაშვილი), was adapted by Ioseb Kechakmadze (Georgian: იოსებ კეჭაყმაძე) to form the anthem. The lyrics were composed by David Magradze (Georgian: დავით მაღრაძე).
