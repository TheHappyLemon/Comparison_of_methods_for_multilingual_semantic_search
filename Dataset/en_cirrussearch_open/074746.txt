The Konik or Polish Konik (Polish: konik polski) is a Polish breed of pony. There are semi-feral populations in some regions. They are usually mouse dun or striped dun in color. The Bilgoray (Polish: konik biłgorajski) of south-eastern Poland is a sub-type of the breed influenced by Arab and Thoroughbred blood; it is close to extinction. The extinct Sweyki or Schweike sub-type of East Prussia contributed to the development of the Trakehner.: 481  The word "konik" means 'small horse'. It may be used in a wider sense to describe the Polish Konik and other similar breeds, among them the Hutsul of the Carpathian Mountains, the Polesian of Belarus and the Žemaitukas of Lithuania.: 481
