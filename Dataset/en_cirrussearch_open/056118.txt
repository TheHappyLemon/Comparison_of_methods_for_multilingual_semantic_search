The Byrranga Mountains (Russian: го́ры Бырра́нга; Gory Byrranga) are a mountain range in the middle of the Taymyr Peninsula, Siberia, Russia. Even though they were first explored in 1736, the Byrranga Mountains are one of the least known areas of the Arctic. The climate is continental and harsh, with frequent blizzards in the winter. This mountain range falls into the Krasnoyarsk Krai administrative division of the Russian Federation and is part of the Great Arctic State Nature Reserve, the largest nature reserve in Russia. However, the area is very remote, there is almost no population, and access is very difficult for the lack of roads and settlements.
