St. Michael the Archangel's Church or the Garrison Church (Lithuanian: Švento Arkangelo Mykolo Bažnyčia; Russian: Церковь Святого Михаила Архангела) is a Roman Catholic church in the city of Kaunas, Lithuania, closing the perspective of the Laisvės alėja, the main pedestrian street. It was built between 1891 and 1895 when Kaunas was part of the Russian Empire, in Neo-Byzantine style largely for the use of the Russian Orthodox garrison of Kaunas Fortress.
