St. Mary's Cathedral, Tallinn (Estonian: Toomkirik, full name: Tallinna PÃ¼ha Neitsi Maarja Piiskoplik Toomkirik, German: Ritter- und Domkirche, English: The Episcopal Cathedral of the Holy Virgin Mary, Tallinn, also known as the Dome Church) is a cathedral church located on Toompea Hill in Tallinn, Estonia. Originally established by Danes in the 13th century, it is the oldest church in Tallinn and mainland Estonia. It is also the only building in Toompea which survived the 17th-century fire. Originally a Roman Catholic cathedral, it became Lutheran in 1561 and now belongs to the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Tallinn, the spiritual leader of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church, and chairman of that church's governing synod. The church has been a national cultural monument of Estonia since 20 September 1995.
