Steplag or Stepnoy Camp Directorate, Special Camp No. 4 (Степлаг (Степной лагерь), Особлаг (Особый лагерь) № 4) was an MVD special camp for political prisoners within the Gulag system of the Soviet Union. It was established on February 28, 1948, on the base of the Spasozavodsky (Спасозаводский) POW camp near Karaganda, Kazakhstan. In May 1948 it was moved to Jezkazgan. In 1956, Steplag was disestablished, and its camps were transferred to the administration of the Kazakh SSR. Main works were construction works, copper and coal mining, but various odd jobs as well. Initially it was planned for 10,000 inmates but it was expanded with more subcamps and at its height it held about 28,000 in 1950. Between May and June 1954, the Kengir uprising happened in Steplag.
