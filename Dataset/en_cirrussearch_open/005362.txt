The Orvin Mountains (Norwegian: Orvinfjella) constitute a major group of mountain ranges, extending for about 100 km (62 mi) between the Wohlthat Mountains and the Mühlig-Hofmann Mountains in Queen Maud Land. With its summit at 3,055 metres (10,023 ft), the massive Sandeggtind Peak forms the highest point in the Conrad Mountains, a subrange of the Orvin Mountains.
