55°17′42″N 20°59′26″E﻿ / ﻿55.2949336°N 20.9906353°E﻿ / 55.2949336; 20.9906353 The Parnidis Dune (Lithuanian: Parnidžio kopa) is a drifting (semi-permanent) coastal sand dune on the Curonian Spit, southeast of Nida, Lithuania, near the Lithuania-Russia border of the spit. It is almost entirely bare and reaches a height of 52 metres (171 ft) above sea level. Its height once reached a maximum of 60 metres, but decreased due to the dune's steady eastward movement and discharge of sand into the Curonian lagoon, prominently at the Parnidis Cape [lt] under the wind-induced saltation.
