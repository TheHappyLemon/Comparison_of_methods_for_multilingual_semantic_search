The Dartmoor Pony is a breed of pony that lives in Devon, England. The breed has been in England for centuries and is used in a variety of roles. Because of the extreme weather conditions experienced on the moors, the Dartmoor Pony is a particularly hardy breed with excellent stamina. Over the centuries, it has been used as a working animal by local tin miners and quarry workers. It is kept in a semiferal state on Dartmoor. Despite this, numbers living on the open moor have declined from an estimated 5,000 in 1900 to about 300 registered ponies today.[when?] Only around 800 ponies were known to be grazing the moor in the spring of 2004.
