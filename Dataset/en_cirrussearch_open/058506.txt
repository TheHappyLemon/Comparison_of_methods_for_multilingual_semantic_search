Ștefan Daniel Radu (Romanian pronunciation: [ʃteˈfan daniˈel ˈradu]; born 22 October 1986) is a Romanian former professional footballer who played as a left-back or a centre-back. After a stint in his home country with Dinamo București during which he earned three domestic honours, including one national title, Radu moved to Lazio on an initial loan in 2008. He spent the rest of his career with the Biancocelesti, gaining team captaincy and winning the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana on three occasions each. Radu became the leading appearance maker for Lazio in all competitions in 2021, and two years later retired from football. Radu registered his senior debut for the Romania national team in 2006, and made thirteen appearances before retiring early in 2013, at age 26.
