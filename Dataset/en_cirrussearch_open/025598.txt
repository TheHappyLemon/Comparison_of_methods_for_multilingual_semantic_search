The Galgo Español, or Spanish Greyhound, is an ancient breed of dog, specifically a member of the sighthound family. The English greyhound is possibly a descendant of the Spanish greyhound and, for several years in the 20th century, some breeders did cross - breed Galgos and Greyhounds in order to produce faster and more powerful Galgos, specifically for track racing purposes.
