The 2017 Amgen Tour of California was a road cycling stage race that took place between 14 and 20 May. It was the 12th edition of the Tour of California and the 22nd event of the 2017 UCI World Tour; the first time that the race has been staged as part of the World Tour. New Zealand's George Bennett (LottoNL–Jumbo) took the first victory of his professional career, winning the general classification by 35 seconds ahead of Polish rider Rafał Majka, riding for the Bora–Hansgrohe team. Majka had held the race lead after winning the second stage ahead of Bennett, but Bennett's superior performance during the penultimate day time trial at Big Bear Lake allowed him to take the race lead, and ultimately the race win. Bennett's win was the first overall win by a rider from New Zealand at UCI World Tour level. The podium was completed by the top home rider, Cannondale–Drapac member Andrew Talansky, a second in arrears of Majka. In the other classifications, Majka's teammate Peter Sagan won the sprints classification, and its accompanying green jersey, for the seventh time in eight years; Colombian rider Daniel Jaramillo (UnitedHealthcare) edged out Rally Cycling's Evan Huffman on a countback to win the polka-dot jersey for the mountains classification, while a final-day attack by Australian Lachlan Morton (Team Dimension Data) allowed him to regain the white jersey of young rider classification leader that he had lost the previous day to Team Sky's Tao Geoghegan Hart. The teams classification was won by Team Sky, after placing both Ian Boswell and Geoghegan Hart in the top-ten overall. Huffman won the most stages during the race with two, the first time that a UCI Continental team had won on the UCI World Tour.
