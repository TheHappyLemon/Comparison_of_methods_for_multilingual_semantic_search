The women's monobob competition in bobsleigh at the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 13 February (heats 1 and 2) and 14 February (heats 3 and 4), at the Xiaohaituo Bobsleigh and Luge Track in Yanqing District of Beijing. This was the inaugural monobob competition at the Olympics. Kaillie Humphries of the United States won the event. She was the 2018 two-woman bobsleigh champion, but at that time she represented Canada. Elana Meyers Taylor, also of the United States, won the silver medal, and Christine de Bruin of Canada bronze, her first Olympic medal. In July 2018, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially added the women's monobob event to the program, increasing the total number of events to four. In the first day of competition, Humphries won both runs and developed an advantage over the second place, Christine de Bruin, with over a second. She won Run 3 as well, and was the third in the last run, which was sufficient for the gold medal. De Bruin dropped to third, and Meyers Taylor won the last run and guaranteed the silver medal.
