Muntinlupa (Tagalog: [mʊntɪnˈlupɐ]), officially the City of Muntinlupa (Filipino: Lungsod ng Muntinlupa), is a 1st class highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 543,445 people. It is bordered on the north by Taguig, to the northwest by Parañaque, by Bacoor and Las Piñas to the west, to the southwest by Dasmariñas, by San Pedro to the south, and by Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the country, to the east. From high above, the city of Muntinlupa has many large, green patches, which is unusual for Metro Manila. Because of these green patches, Muntinlupa earned the name "Emerald City" by the tourism establishment and also known as the "Gateway to Calabarzon" as it is the southernmost city of the National Capital Region. Muntinlupa is known as the location of the national insular penitentiary, the New Bilibid Prison, where the country's most dangerous criminals are incarcerated. This was relocated from its old site in Santa Cruz, Manila. Before the relocation of New Bilibid Prison to Muntinlupa in the 1930s, Muntinlupa was mainly dedicated to fishing and farming. Ayala Alabang Village, one of the country's biggest and most expensive residential communities, where many of the wealthy and famous live, is also located in Muntinlupa.
