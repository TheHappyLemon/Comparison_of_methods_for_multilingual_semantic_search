The province of Rimini (Italian: provincia di Rimini) is the southernmost province of the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Rimini, one of the "seven sisters" of the historical region of Romagna. The province borders the Adriatic Sea to its northeast, the province of Forl√¨-Cesena to its northwest, the province of Pesaro and Urbino, in the Marche region, to its south and southeast, the independent Republic of San Marino to its south, and the province of Arezzo in Tuscany to its southwest. The province consists of 27 comuni (sg.: comune), centred on the valleys of the Marecchia and Conca rivers. Since the transfer of nine comuni (municipalities) from Pesaro and Urbino in 2009 and 2021, the province of Rimini includes most of the historical region of Montefeltro.
