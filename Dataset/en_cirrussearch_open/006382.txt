Nikoláy Aslánovich Pirosmanashvíli (Georgian: ნიკოლოზ ფიროსმანაშვილი) or Niko Pirosmani (Georgian: ნიკო ფიროსმანი), simply referred to as Nikala (ნიკალა Nik’ala; 1862–1918), was a Georgian painter who posthumously rose to prominence. Relatively poor for most of his life, he worked a variety of ordinary jobs. His rustic, everyday scenes are celebrated today for their depiction of the Georgia of Pirosmani's lifetime, and he has become one of the country's most beloved artistic figures. Niko Pirosmani is alleged to be the inspiration for the male protagonist portrayed in the famous Russian song Million Roses.
