The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Belize accepted the convention on November 6, 1990, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Belize has only one World Heritage Site, Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, which was inscribed in 1996.
