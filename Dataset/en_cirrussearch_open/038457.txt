James Byron Dean (February 8, 1931 – September 30, 1955) was an American actor with a career that lasted five years until his death. His roles typified teenage disillusionment and social estrangement of his time. He had uncredited gigs from 1951 to 1953 before starring as a rebellious son attempting to win his father's approval in East of Eden (1955). In Rebel Without a Cause (1955), he portrayed a teenager frustrated with his family and social life. His last lead role was a Texan rancher who discovered oil and became rich, in Giant (1956). Dean died in a car crash in 1955. He became the only actor to receive two posthumous Academy Award acting nominations, being nominated in the Best Actor category for East of Eden and Giant. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him the 18th best male movie star of Golden Age Hollywood in the AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars list. Dean's film roles, fashion, and manners became celebrated in popular culture and influenced the development of rock and roll in the 1950s and 1960s.
