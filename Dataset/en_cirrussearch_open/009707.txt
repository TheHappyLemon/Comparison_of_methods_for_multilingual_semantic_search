The Chemical Brothers are an English electronic music duo formed by Ed Simons and Tom Rowlands in Manchester in 1989. They were pioneers in bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture. Originally known as The Dust Brothers, they changed their name due to the existence of another band with the same name. Their first album Exit Planet Dust sold over one million copies and debuted at No. 9 on the UK Albums Chart. After attracting Virgin Records, the duo achieved further success with their second album Dig Your Own Hole (1997), which topped the UK chart. They have had six No. 1 albums and 13 top-20 singles in the UK, including two chart-toppers. They have won six Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Instrumental Performance, Best Dance Recording, and Best Dance/Electronic Album.
