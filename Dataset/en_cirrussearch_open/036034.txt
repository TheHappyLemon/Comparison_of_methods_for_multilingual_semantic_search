Small cells are low-powered cellular radio access nodes that operate in spectrum that have a range of 10 meters to a few kilometers. They are base stations with low power consumption and cheap cost. They can provide high data rates by being deployed densely to achieve high spatial spectrum efficiency. Recent FCC orders have provided size and elevation guidelines to help more clearly define small cell equipment. They are "small" compared to a mobile macrocell, partly because they have a shorter range and partly because they typically handle fewer concurrent calls or sessions. As wireless carriers seek to 'densify' existing wireless networks to provide for the data capacity demands of 5G, small cells are currently viewed as a solution to allow re-using the same frequencies, and as an important method of increasing cellular network capacity, quality, and resilience with a growing focus using LTE Advanced.
