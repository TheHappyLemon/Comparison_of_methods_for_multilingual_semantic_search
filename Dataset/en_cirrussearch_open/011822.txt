Anton Amad√© Abele (born 10 January 1992) is a Swedish activist, debater and politician who was Member of Parliament for Stockholm County, replacing former Minister for Culture and Sports Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth, from the 2010 general election until the 2014 general election. At the age of 18, he is the youngest person ever to become a Member of Parliament in Sweden, as well as the youngest ever member of any national legislature in the world. He entered the political scene as an anti-violence activist following the death of 16-year-old Riccardo Campogiani, who was beaten to death in October 2007. On 25 July 2013 Abele announced that he will finish his term in the Swedish Parliament, then end his political career and not run for re-election in the 2014 general election, citing disillusionment with the working climate in the Parliament.
