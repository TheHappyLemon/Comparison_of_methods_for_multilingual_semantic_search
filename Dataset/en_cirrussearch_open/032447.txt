Daddy's Daughters (Russian: Папины дочки, romanized: Papiny Dochki) is a Russian TV series produced from 2007 to 2013. Made by "Kinokonstanta" (episodes 1 to 60) and "Kostafilm" (since episode 61) film companies, it is characterized by various aspects of life — family, love, work, study, and friendship. The series has very high television ratings and has won multiple awards (received four "TEFI"). Unlike many other contemporary Russian sitcoms, this is an original series, and is not an adaptation of a foreign show.
