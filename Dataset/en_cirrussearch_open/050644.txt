Nouadhibou (/ˈnwædiːbuː, ˈnwɑː-/; Arabic: نواذيبو, romanized: Nwādībū, Berber: Nwadibu, formerly in French: Port-Étienne) is the second largest city in Mauritania and serves as a major commercial center. The city has about 118,000 inhabitants. It is situated on a 65-kilometre peninsula or headland called Ras Nouadhibou (Berber: Ighef Nwadibu), Cap Blanc, or Cabo Blanco, of which the western side has the city of La Güera. Nouadhibou is consequently located merely a couple of kilometers from the border between Mauritania and the Western Sahara. Its current Mayor is Elghassem Ould Bellali, who was installed on 15 October 2018.
