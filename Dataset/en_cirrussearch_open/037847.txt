In her complete form, she is a physical representation of Mahadevi also known as Adi Shakti, the primordial power behind the creation of the universe, the creator and destroyer. She is one of the central deities of the goddess-oriented sect called Shaktism, and the supreme goddess in Shaivism. Along with Lakshmi and Sarasvati, she forms the Tridevi. Parvati is the wife of Shiva. She is a primordial goddess in Hinduism. Parvati and Shiva have taken many incarnations and divine forms together. Parvati is the mother of the Hindu deities Ganesha and Kartikeya, Ashokasundari and many other deities. The Puranas also say that she is the companion of the river goddess Ganga, and Vishnu. For Hindus, she is considered to be the divine energy between a man and a woman, like the energy of Shiva and Shakti. Parvati is a powerful, primordial mother goddess, and also has several fearsome forms and killed evil beings in forms such as Gauri, Durga, Kali, the ten Mahavidyas, and the Navadurgas. Parvati is an embodiment of Shakti. In Shaivism, she is the recreative energy and power of Shiva, and she is the cause of a bond that connects all beings and a means of their spiritual release.
