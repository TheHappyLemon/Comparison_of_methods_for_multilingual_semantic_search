The Nokia 5110 is a GSM mobile phone that was introduced by Nokia on 12 April 1998. The 5110, also known as the Nokia 5146 on One2One (now T-Mobile), or the nk402 on Orange in the UK, was intended for the consumer market, succeeding the Nokia 3110 and the analogue Nokia 232. Its design is based on the same platform as Nokia 6110 for the business market. It features a similar, simpler, revamped user interface called Series 20, but lacked the infrared data interface. It can, however, be interfaced with a computer via a cellular data card and a proprietary cable, enabling it to function like a modem to connect to remote computer systems through the Public switched telephone network (PSTN). The Nokia 5110 features an 84Ã—48-pixel monochrome LCD with four LED backlights, operated by the Philips PCD8544 display controller. It is the first Nokia phone to come with replaceable faceplates, which Nokia branded "Xpress-on" covers; a concept Nokia incorporated into several other consumer-oriented cellphones aimed at the young adult market for years to come, allowing users to customize their device. "Xpress-on" was trademarked in the U.S. on 25 February 1998. The Nokia 5110 is also one of the first mobile phones to feature the game Snake. It became one of the most popular phones of its era. The Nokia 5110 was discontinued by the year 2000, having been fully replaced by the smaller Nokia 3210. The Nokia model 5110 received some notoriety following the triple October 2002 Bali bombings that resulted in 202 deaths. A shard from the (remote bomb detonation) phone was recovered outside the US consulate in Denpasar. The fragment included the phone's IMEI number and authorities were able to trace the phone's owner. With this information police & intelligence could then unravel the entire Jemaah Islamiyah terror cell's network.
