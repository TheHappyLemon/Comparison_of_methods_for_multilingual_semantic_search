Quincy Anton Promes (born 4 January 1992) is a Dutch professional footballer playing for Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow, who is currently appealing criminal convictions for aggravated assault and drug trafficking. Prior to those legal issues, he represented the Netherlands national team at the international level as a winger or forward. Promes started his career with Twente in 2011 where he spent three seasons before moving to Russian club Spartak Moscow in the summer of 2014. That year he also won his first senior cap for the Netherlands. Promes won his first major honor in 2017 as Spartak were crowned Russian Premier League (RPL) champions. He was named Footballer of the Year in Russia in 2017 and finished the 2017–18 season as RPL top scorer. In total, he amassed 135 appearances and scored 66 goals over his initial four-year stint with Spartak. He signed for Spanish club Sevilla in 2018 for a reported €20 million but struggled for form there. In 2019, Promes signed for his boyhood club Ajax, where he regained form and was a key player. He played for the Netherlands at UEFA Euro 2020. Promes moved back to Spartak in 2021, and became the top scorer in Spartak's modern era two years later, as well as top foreign scorer in the history of RPL. Promes has been subjected to criminal procedures during his career. In 2020, he was detained over a stabbing incident and subsequently found guilty of aggravated assault in 2023. Later that year, Promes was criminally charged for being involved in cocaine trafficking, and found guilty in 2024. He is appealing both verdicts. Due to these issues, the Dutch national team has not called him up since first being charged 2021. Russia has no extradition treaty with the Netherlands, which has enabled him to continue playing for Spartak.
