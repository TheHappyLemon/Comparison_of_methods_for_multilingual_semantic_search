In chess, the Sicilian Defence, Alapin Variation is a response to the Sicilian Defence characterised by the moves: 1. e4 c5 2. c3 It is named after the Russian master Semyon Alapin (1856–1923). For many years, it was not held in high regard, since 2...d5 was thought to allow Black easy equality. Today, the Alapin is considered to be one of the most solid and respectable Anti-Sicilians, and it is championed by grandmasters such as Evgeny Sveshnikov, Eduardas Rozentalis, Sergei Tiviakov, Duško Pavasovič, and Dražen Sermek. It has been played by World Champions Viswanathan Anand, Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Veselin Topalov, and Vladimir Kramnik, and Deep Blue played the Alapin Variation against Kasparov in their 1996 match. Magnus Carlsen played it in his championship tiebreaker against Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa in the 2023 Fide World Cup. The Alapin is also seen in deferred form, particularly when Black chooses an unusual second move after 2.Nf3. For example, after 2.Nf3 a6 or 2.Nf3 Qc7, 3.c3 is often seen, since neither ...a6 nor ...Qc7 are particularly useful moves against the Alapin.
