Ulrik Wilhelm Eduard Polón (16 June 1861 – 30 September 1930) was a Finnish business leader and a political patriot during the country's years of oppression. Under his leadership, a rubber industry was launched in the country. He was the founder, CEO, chairman of the board and majority shareholder of Suomen Kumitehdas Oy or the Finnish Rubber Company. His group also designed and introduced a modern timber and cable market in Finland. His interests were eventually known as the Nokia group. Polón opposed the Russification of Finland during the periods of oppression and was active in leading the resistance organization Kagal. He was a representative of the bourgeois estate in the parliament from 1905 to 1906. His involvement in the resistance caused him to be deported to Russia in 1916–1917.
