Rudolf Teschner (16 February 1922, Potsdam – 23 July 2006, Berlin-Steglitz) was a German chess master and writer. Teschner was seven times Champion of Berlin. In 1948, he won an East-Zones Championship in Bad Doberan, and later in 1951 took the German Championship (played in Düsseldorf). Teschner was leading member of the German Chess Olympic team in 1952 and 1956. In 1957 he obtained the title of International Master from FIDE. He was 2–3 in the Zonal tournament in Berg en Dal 1960 and twice 1–4 in Christmas tournaments in Reggio Emilia (1963/1964 and 1964/1965). Teschner played in the 1962 Interzonal tournament at Stockholm. FIDE awarded him the complimentary Grandmaster title in 1992, the first in history. Chessmetrics retrospectively ranked him 40th in the world in May 1968 when he played very successful in the Bamberg tournament and won the prize for the most beautiful chess game. Teschner worked between 1950 and 1988 as publisher of Deutsche Schachzeitung (German Chess News, the World's oldest surviving chess magazine), and wrote many books and articles about chess.
