Pakri Islands (Estonian: Pakri saared, Swedish: Rågöarna, German: Groß Pakri) are two Estonian islands in the Finnish Gulf: Suur-Pakri and Väike-Pakri (Swedish: Stora Rågö and Lilla Rågö). Administratively they belong to the town of Paldiski. For centuries the islands had been inhabited by Estonian Swedes, until during the Second World War the entire population was forced to leave.
