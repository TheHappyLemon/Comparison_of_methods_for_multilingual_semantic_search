Linnaea borealis is a species of flowering plant in the family Caprifoliaceae (the honeysuckle family). Until 2013, it was the only species in the genus Linnaea. It is a boreal to subarctic woodland subshrub, commonly known as twinflower (sometimes written twin flower). This plant was a favourite of Carl Linnaeus, founder of the modern system of binomial nomenclature, after whom the genus was named.
