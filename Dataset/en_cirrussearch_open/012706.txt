The National Hockey League All-Star Game (French: Match des Ã©toiles de la Ligue nationale de hockey) is an exhibition ice hockey tournament that is traditionally held during the regular season of the National Hockey League (NHL), with many of the League's star players playing against each other. The game's proceeds benefit the pension fund of the players, and the winning team is awarded $1,000,000 towards a charity of their choice. The NHL All-Star Game, held in late January or early February, marks the symbolic halfway point in the regular season, though not the mathematical halfway point which, for most seasons, is usually one or two weeks earlier. Between 2007 and 2020, it was held in late January. After skipping 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2022 to 2024 editions were held on the first Saturday of February.
