Callirrhoe (/kəˈlɪroʊ.iː/; Greek: Καλλιρρόη), also known as Jupiter XVII, is one of Jupiter's outer natural satellites. It is an irregular moon that orbits in a retrograde direction. Callirrhoe was imaged by Spacewatch at Kitt Peak National Observatory from October 6 through November 4, 1999, and originally designated as asteroid 1999 UX18. It was discovered to be in orbit around Jupiter by Tim Spahr on July 18, 2000, and then given the designation S/1999 J 1. It was the 17th confirmed moon of Jupiter.
