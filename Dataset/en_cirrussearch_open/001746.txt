Jenny Margareta Kallur (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈjɛ̌nːʏ ˈkǎlːɵr]; born 16 February 1981) is a Swedish former track and field athlete who competed in hurdling and sprinting events. Her twin sister Susanna Kallur, who is four minutes younger, is also a 100 m hurdler. She was coached by Torbjörn Eriksson and Anders Henriksson. Her first athletic successes came as a young athlete: she won the 100 metres title at the European Youth Olympic Festival in 1997 and took a bronze medal in the sprint relay at the 2000 World Junior Championships in Athletics, setting a Swedish junior record. She made successive appearances on the European, World and Olympic stage from 2002 to 2004. Her best performances came in 2005, when she won the silver medal at the European Athletics Indoor Championships behind her sister and then teamed up with her to run a Swedish national record in the 4×100 metres relay at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics (where she was sixth in the hurdles final). She reached the hurdles finals at both the 2006 IAAF World Indoor Championships and the 2006 European Athletics Championships, but injuries brought her career to a halt in 2007, eventually resulting in her retirement from the sport in 2011. She won 100/200 m sprint doubles at the 1998 and 2002 Swedish National Championships, and won a fifth outdoor title in the 100 m hurdles in 2006. She is also a three-time Swedish champion indoors, having won the 60 metres title in 2004 and the 200 metres title in 1998 and 2000.
