A kremlin (Russian: кремль, tr. kreml', IPA: [ˈkrʲemlʲ] ) is a major fortified central complex found in historic Russian cities. The word is often used to refer to the Moscow Kremlin and - metonymically - to the government based there. Other such fortresses are called detinets, such as the Novgorod Detinets.
