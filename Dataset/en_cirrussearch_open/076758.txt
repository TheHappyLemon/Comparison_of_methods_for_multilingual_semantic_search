A rain gauge (also known as udometer, pluviometer, pluviameter, ombrometer, and hyetometer) is an instrument used by meteorologists and hydrologists to gather and measure the amount of liquid precipitation over a predefined area, over a period of time. It is used to determine the depth of precipitation (usually in mm) that occurs over a unit area and measure rainfall amount.
