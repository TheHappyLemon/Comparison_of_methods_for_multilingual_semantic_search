A Strug is a type of flat-bottomed boat which was in use primarily in Russia from the 11th - 18th centuries, for the transport of people and cargo as well as military uses. Designs varied somewhat between different regions of Russia, with typical parameters being a length of 20-45 meters, a width of 4-10 meters, and from 6-20 oars. In some cases both the bow and stern were similarly pointed. Many were equipped with a removable mast and small straight sail, which could be used when the wind permitted, and some models also had a small cabin.
