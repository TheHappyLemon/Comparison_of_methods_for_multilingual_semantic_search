A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers a, b, and c, such that a2 + b2 = c2. Such a triple is commonly written (a, b, c), a well-known example is (3, 4, 5). If (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple, then so is (ka, kb, kc) for any positive integer k. A triangle whose side lengths are a Pythagorean triple is a right triangle and called a Pythagorean triangle. A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a, b and c are coprime (that is, they have no common divisor larger than 1). For example, (3, 4, 5) is a primitive Pythagorean triple whereas (6, 8, 10) is not. Every Pythagorean triple can be scaled to a unique primitive Pythagorean triple by dividing (a, b, c) by their greatest common divisor. Conversely, every Pythagorean triple can be obtained by multiplying the elements of a primitive Pythagorean triple by a positive integer (the same for the three elements). The name is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, stating that every right triangle has side lengths satisfying the formula a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}; thus, Pythagorean triples describe the three integer side lengths of a right triangle. However, right triangles with non-integer sides do not form Pythagorean triples. For instance, the triangle with sides a=b=1{\displaystyle a=b=1} and c=2{\displaystyle c={\sqrt {2}}} is a right triangle, but (1,1,2){\displaystyle (1,1,{\sqrt {2}})} is not a Pythagorean triple because 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} is not an integer. Moreover, 1{\displaystyle 1} and 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} do not have an integer common multiple because 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} is irrational. Pythagorean triples have been known since ancient times. The oldest known record comes from Plimpton 322, a Babylonian clay tablet from about 1800 BC, written in a sexagesimal number system. It was discovered by Edgar James Banks shortly after 1900, and sold to George Arthur Plimpton in 1922, for $10 (equivalent to $182 now). When searching for integer solutions, the equation a2 + b2 = c2 is a Diophantine equation. Thus Pythagorean triples are among the oldest known solutions of a nonlinear Diophantine equation.
