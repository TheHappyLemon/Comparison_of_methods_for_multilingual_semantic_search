Henri Grob (4 June 1904 – c. 5 July 1974) was a Swiss chess player, artist, and painter. He was Swiss chess champion twice, and was awarded the title of International Master in 1950 at its inauguration. Grob pioneered eccentric chess openings, in particular 1.g4, about which he wrote a book (Angriff g2–g4, Zürich, 1942). The opening is today commonly known as Grob's Attack, and it is this opening that brought him fame within chess communities around the globe rather than his results in chess competitions.
