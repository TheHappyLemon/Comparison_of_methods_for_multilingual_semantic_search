Waterboat Point (Spanish: Península Munita) is the low westernmost termination of the peninsula between Paradise Harbor and Andvord Bay on the west coast of Graham Land. This feature has "island" characteristics, but it is only separated from the mainland at high water and is more usefully described as a "point". Chile's González Videla Antarctic Base is located at Waterboat Point.
