The Book of Ruth (Hebrew: מְגִלַּת רוּת, Megillath Ruth, "the Scroll of Ruth", one of the Five Megillot) is included in the third division, or the Writings (Ketuvim), of the Hebrew Bible. In most Christian canons it is treated as one of the historical books and placed between Judges and 1 Samuel. The book, written in Hebrew during the Persian period (c. 550-330 BCE), tells of the Moabite woman Ruth, who accepts Yahweh, the God of the Israelites, as her God and accepts the Israelite people as her own. It differs in legal matters from the Pentateuch and shows the difficulty of confirming widespread Torah-observance in the Persian period. The book is held in esteem by Jewish converts, as is evidenced by the considerable presence of Boaz in rabbinic literature. It also functions liturgically, as it is read during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot ("Weeks").
