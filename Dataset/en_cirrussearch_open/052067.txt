The 2020 Milan–San Remo was scheduled to be held on 21 March 2020, but was postponed to 8 August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The postponement was made by RCS Sport on 6 March. It was the 111th edition of the Milan–San Remo one-day cycling classic in Northern Italy, and part of the 2020 UCI World Tour calendar. Belgian rider Wout van Aert of Team Jumbo–Visma, who had won the 2020 Strade Bianche a week earlier, beat French rider Julian Alaphilippe, the defending champion, of Deceuninck–Quick-Step, in a two-up sprint to take the victory, after the duo had broken away from the peloton on the ascent of the Poggio.
