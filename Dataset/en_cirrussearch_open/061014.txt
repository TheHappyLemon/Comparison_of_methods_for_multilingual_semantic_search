Hamarkameratene (lit.â€‰'the Hamar Comrades'), often abbreviated to HamKam or Ham-Kam, is a Norwegian football club based in the town of Hamar. The club was founded in 1918, originally under the name Freidig. HamKam were most recently promoted to the Eliteserien in 2021. A third-place finish in 1970 is the highest position that the team has held in the top division; the club has never progressed beyond the semifinals of the Norwegian Cup, last reaching the semifinals in 1989. Briskeby Stadion has been the home ground of Hamarkameratene since 1936. The construction of a completely modernized stadium began in 2007 but has never been completed. Originally scheduled to be completed in 2009, the expanded Briskeby is expected to have a capacity of 10,200 spectators on completion, but currently has a capacity of approximately 8,100.
