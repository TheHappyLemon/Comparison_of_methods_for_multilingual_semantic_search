Football Club Oleksandriya (Ukrainian: Футбольний клуб Олександрія), commonly known as Oleksandriya, is a Ukrainian professional football club based in the city of Oleksandriya, Kirovohrad Oblast. Founded in 1990, the club plays in the Ukrainian Premier League. The year 1948 on the club's crest appeared after its merger with UkrAhroKom in 2014 and depicts football heritage of the club rather than the club's foundation. In 2014 the club changed ownership when the original owner Mykola Lavrenko sold it to Serhiy Kuzmenko, the owner of UkrAhroKom. Debuting in the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League in July 2016, the club became the first one from Kirovohrad Oblast to qualify for the European competitions and second after Kryvbas in Central Ukraine (right-bank).
