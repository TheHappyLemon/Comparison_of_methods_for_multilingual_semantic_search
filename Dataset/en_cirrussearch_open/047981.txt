The University of Greenland (Greenlandic: Ilisimatusarfik Kalaallit Nunaat; Danish: Gr√∏nlands Universitet) is Greenland's only university. It is in the capital city of Nuuk. Most courses are taught in Danish, a few in Greenlandic and classes by exchange lecturers often in English. The university had an enrollment of 205 students in 2018, composed of mostly Greenlandic inhabitants. It has around fourteen academic staff and five technical-administrative employees. The modest student population is due, in part, to most Greenlandic students going to universities in Denmark.
