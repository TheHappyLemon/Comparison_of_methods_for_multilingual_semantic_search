The Olympus 35 RC is a 35 mm rangefinder camera manufactured by Olympus in Japan in the 1970s. It claimed to be the smallest 35Â mm rangefinder with automatic exposure control and manual override. Its viewfinder readouts for selected aperture/shutter speed settings are unique for a compact camera, later reiterated in the 35RD.
