Djurgårdens IF Ishockeyförening, commonly known as Djurgårdens IF, Djurgården Hockey, Djurgården (IPA: [ˈjʉ̂ːrˌɡoːɖɛn]), is a professional ice hockey team based in Stockholm, Sweden, affiliated with the Djurgårdens IF umbrella organization. Djurgården compete in the Swedish second-tier ice hockey league, the HockeyAllsvenskan. The men's team is the most successful Swedish ice hockey team of all time, as 16-time Swedish champions, 12-time runners-up, 26-time finalists, and leaders of the marathon table for the top flight of Swedish hockey. The ice hockey section was first established in 1922 and has since been playing in the Swedish league system, with the exception of four years in the 1930s when the hockey section was temporarily dissolved. Djurgården primarily play their home games at Hovet, an older arena built in the 1950s with a capacity of 8,094, but high-profile matches such as derbies against AIK and playoff games may be played in Avicii Arena with its larger capacity of 13,850. Djurgården have retired nine players' jerseys in their history, and have retired the number 2 twice, since both Roland Stoltz and Charles Berglund had worn the number before retiring jerseys became well-established in Sweden. The most common nicknames for the team are "Järnkaminerna" (The Iron Stoves), "Stockholms stolthet" (The Pride of Stockholm) and "Mesta mästarna" (The Winners of Most Championships). Djurgården also has a supporters' club called Järnkaminerna, which it shares with the football section.
