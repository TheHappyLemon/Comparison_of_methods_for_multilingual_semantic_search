Pidhaitsi Raion (Ukrainian: Підгаєцький район) was a raion (district) in the western part of Ternopil Oblast, western Ukraine. It was part of the historic area known as Halychyna (Galicia). The administrative center was the city of Pidhaitsi. The Koropets river flowed through the district. This raion was formed as a separate district on December 6, 1991 by a decree of the Ukrainian parliament. Before that it was part of neighbouring Berezhany Raion. The raion was abolished on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ternopil Oblast to three. The area of Pidhaitsi Raion was merged into Ternopil Raion. The last estimate of the raion population was 17,534 (2020 est.).
