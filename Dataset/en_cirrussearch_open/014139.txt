Gadebusch (German pronunciation: [ˈɡaːdəbʊʃ]) is a town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in the district of Nordwestmecklenburg. Halfway between Lübeck, Schwerin and Wismar, it is part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. The town is known for two notable monuments: the Stadtkirche (City Church), built in 1220, considered the oldest brick church in Mecklenburg, and the Schloss (Castle), built in 1580–1583 in Northern Renaissance style. Near the town is the site of the Battle of Gadebusch in 1712.
