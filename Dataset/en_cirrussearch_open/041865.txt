Nesvizh Castle or Nyasvizh Castle (Belarusian: Нясвіжскі замак, romanized: Niasvižski zamak; Russian: Несвижский замок; Polish: zamek w Nieświeżu; Lithuanian: Nesvyžiaus pilis) is a residential castle of the Radziwiłł family in Nyasvizh (Nesvizh), Belarus. It is 183 metres (600 ft) above sea level. Built in the 16th and 17th centuries, and maintained by the Radziwiłł family until 1939, the castle and the nearby Corpus Christi Church were instrumental in the development of Central European and Russian architecture. In 2005, the castle, church, and surrounding environment were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
