Ivan Ljubičić (Croatian pronunciation: [ǐʋan ʎûbitʃitɕ]; born 19 March 1979) is a Croatian former professional tennis player. He reached a career-high Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 3 singles ranking on 1 May 2006. His career highlights include reaching a major semifinal at the 2006 French Open, and a Masters title at the Indian Wells Masters in 2010. He also contested three other Masters finals, two in 2005 at Madrid and Paris, and the other at the 2006 Miami Open. Since retiring, Ljubičić has coached ATP top-3-ranked players Milos Raonic and Roger Federer. He was credited with Federer's improved backhand later in his career, especially evident on high shots, as well as introducing tactical changes of taking shots much earlier: taking more time, pace, and rhythm off opponents and simultaneously making Federer's game more offensive.
