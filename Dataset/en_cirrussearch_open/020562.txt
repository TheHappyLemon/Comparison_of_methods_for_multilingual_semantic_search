Camembert (/ˈkæməmbɛər/, also UK: /-mɒmbɛər/, French: [kamɑ̃bɛʁ] ) is a moist, soft, creamy, surface-ripened cow's milk cheese. It was first made in the late 18th century in Camembert, Normandy, in northwest France. It is sometimes compared in look and taste to brie cheese, albeit with a slightly lower butterfat content than brie's typically 20% - 25% by weight.
