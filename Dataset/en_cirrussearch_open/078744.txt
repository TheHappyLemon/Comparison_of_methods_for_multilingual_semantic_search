The Soviet Union women's national basketball team (Russian: Сбо́рная СССР по баскетболу, tr. sbórnaya SSSR po basketbolu) was the women's basketball side that represented the Soviet Union in international competitions. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the successor countries all set up their own national teams.
