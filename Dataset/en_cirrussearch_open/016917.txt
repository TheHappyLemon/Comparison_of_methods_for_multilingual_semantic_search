Marambio Station (Spanish: Estación Marambio) is a permanent, all year-round Argentine Antarctica station named after Vice-Commodore Gustavo Argentino Marambio [es], an Antarctic aviation pioneer. It is located in Marambio Island, Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula, some 100 km (60 mi) from the coastal civilian village of Esperanza. At the time of its construction it was the first airfield in Antarctica and is still one of the most frequently used ones due to its suitability for wheeled landing, for which it is called "Antarctica's Entrance Door" (Spanish: Puerta de Entrada a la Antártida). It is also Argentina's most important station in the continent. As of 2014, Marambio is one of 13 research stations in Antarctica operated by Argentina.
