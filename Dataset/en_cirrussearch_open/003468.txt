The 1940 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XII Olympiad, was a planned international multi-sport event scheduled to have been held from September 21 to October 6, 1940 in Tokyo City, Empire of Japan, and later rescheduled for July 20 to August 4, 1940 in Helsinki, Finland following the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. They were ultimately cancelled due to World War II alongside the 1940 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Empire of Japan, and were the third games to be canceled due to war. Helsinki would eventually host the 1952 Summer Olympics. Tokyo would also later host the 1964 and 2020 Summer Olympics, the latter being postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
