Lithuania competed at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Netherlands. After the disappointing debut in the 1924 Summer Olympics, Lithuania was better prepared for the games in Amsterdam. In 1926 it organized the first national Olympics (Lithuanian: Lietuvos sporto šventė). Lithuania sent 12 athletes to compete in 4 sports: athletics, boxing, cycling, and weightlifting. The best result was achieved by boxer Juozas Vinča, who shared 5th–8th places. Lithuania did not appear in the Olympics again until after the restoration of independence in 1992.
