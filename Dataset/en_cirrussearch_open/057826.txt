The Little Prince (French: Le Petit Prince; Italian: Il piccolo principe) is a 2015 animated fantasy adventure drama film directed by Mark Osborne and based on the 1943 novella of the same name by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The film stars the voices of Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, Paul Rudd, Bud Cort, Marion Cotillard, Benicio del Toro, James Franco, Ricky Gervais, Paul Giamatti, Riley Osborne, Albert Brooks and Mackenzie Foy. It is the first adaptation as a full-length animated feature of The Little Prince. The film relates the story of the book using stop motion animation, which is woven into an animated framing narrative about a young girl who has just met the book's now-elderly aviator narrator, who tells her the story of his meeting with the Little Prince in the Sahara desert. The film's animation was provided by studios ON Animation Studios and Mikros Image. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 22 May 2015 in an out-of-competition screening, followed by a theatrical release in France on 29 July 2015 by Paramount Pictures and in Italy on 1 January 2016 by Lucky Red. The film was originally set to be released theatrically in the United States on 18 March 2016 before budget cuts halted the release; Netflix later acquired the US, UK and Australia distribution rights and released it on 5 August 2016. The film has received positive reviews, earning praise for its style of animation and homage paid to the source material, and earned $97.6 million on a €75 million budget, becoming the most successful French animated film abroad of all time.
