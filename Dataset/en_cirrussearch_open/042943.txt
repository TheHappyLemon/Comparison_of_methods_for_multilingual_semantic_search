The Korea International Circuit (코리아 인터내셔널 서킷) is a 5.615 km (3.489 mi) motorsport circuit located in Yeongam, South Jeolla Province, South Korea, 400 km (250 mi) south of Seoul and near the port city of Mokpo. It was the venue for the Korean Grand Prix from 2010 to 2013 after a $264 million (250 billion won) deal between Bernie Ecclestone and the Korean F1 promoter Korea Auto Valley Operation (KAVO – a joint venture between M-Bridge Holdings and Jeollanam-do regional government). By 2015, having only hosted four Grand Prix events and relegated to hosting modestly attended local races, the facility has been criticized as a debacle.
