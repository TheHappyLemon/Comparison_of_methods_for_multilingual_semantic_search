Amsterdam is a 2022 period mystery comedy thriller film directed, written, and produced by David O. Russell and starring Christian Bale (who also produced the film), Margot Robbie, and John David Washington alongside an ensemble supporting cast including Chris Rock, Anya Taylor-Joy, Zoe Saldaña, Mike Myers, Michael Shannon, Timothy Olyphant, Andrea Riseborough, Taylor Swift, Matthias Schoenaerts, Alessandro Nivola, Rami Malek, and Robert De Niro. The story is based on the Business Plot, a 1933 political conspiracy in the United States, and follows three friends—a doctor, a nurse, and a lawyer—who reunite and seek to uncover the act following the mysterious murder of a retired U.S. general. Filmed in Los Angeles from January to March 2021, it is Russell's first film since Joy (2015). Amsterdam premiered at the Alice Tully Hall on September 18, 2022 and was theatrically released in the United States on October 7, by 20th Century Studios. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized Russell's screenplay and direction for its over-ambition and tonal inconsistency, but praised the production design and cast performances. It was also a box-office bomb, with estimated losses for the studio of over $100 million.
