The 1992 King Fahd Cup (Arabic: كَأْسُ الْمَلِك فَهْد), named after Fahd of Saudi Arabia, was the first association football tournament of the competition that would later be known as the FIFA Confederations Cup. It was hosted by Saudi Arabia in October 1992, and was won by Argentina, who beat Saudi Arabia 3–1 in the final. The 1992 tournament was the only one not to feature a group stage and only featured four nations.
