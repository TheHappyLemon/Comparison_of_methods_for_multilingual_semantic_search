S/2022 J 3 is a small outer natural satellite of Jupiter discovered by Scott S. Sheppard on 30 August 2022, using the 4.0-meter Víctor M. Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo Observatory, Chile. It was announced by the Minor Planet Center on 22 February 2023, after observations were collected over a long enough time span to confirm the satellite's orbit. S/2022 J 3 is part of the Ananke group, a cluster of retrograde irregular moons of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Ananke at semi-major axes between 19–22 million km (12–14 million mi), orbital eccentricities between 0.1 and 0.4, and inclinations between 139 and 155°. It has a diameter of about 1 km (0.62 mi) for an absolute magnitude of 17.3. The moon has been observed for over 20 years, with the earliest known observation on 26 February 2003.
