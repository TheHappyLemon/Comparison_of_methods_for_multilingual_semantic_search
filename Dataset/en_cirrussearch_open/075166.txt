Izium or Izyum (Ukrainian: Ізюм, IPA: [iˈzʲum] ; Russian: Изюм) is a city on the Donets River in Kharkiv Oblast, eastern Ukraine. It serves as the administrative center of Izium Raion. Izium hosts the administration of Izium urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. It is about 120 kilometres (75 mi) southeast of the administrative center of the oblast, Kharkiv. Izium has a population of 44,979 (2022 estimate), making it the second-most populous city in Kharkiv Oblast behind Kharkiv proper. It has held economic significance for centuries due to its position as a transportation link between Kharkiv and the Donbas region to the southeast. The area around Izium has been periodically inhabited since ancient times, but the modern city has its origins in a 17th-century fortress defending against Tatar raids. Izium went on to be the site of several significant battles during World War II, but still grew rapidly during the 20th century due to its importance as a transport hub. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces occupied the city in April 2022 after a battle that destroyed much of the city. However, the city was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in the 2022 Kharkiv counteroffensive.
