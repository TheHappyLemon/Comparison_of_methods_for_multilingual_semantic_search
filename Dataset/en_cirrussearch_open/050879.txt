Olavinlinna (also known as St. Olaf's Castle; Swedish: Olofsborg; German: Olafsburg; literally Olof's Castle) is a 15th-century three-tower castle located in Savonlinna, Finland. It is built on an island in the Kyr√∂nsalmi strait that connects the lakes Haukivesi and Pihlajavesi. It is the northernmost medieval stone fortress still standing. The castle forms a spectacular stage for the Savonlinna Opera Festival, which was held for the first time in the summer of 1912.
