Latvia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation's eighth appearance at the Summer Olympics. The Latvian Olympic Committee sent the nation's smallest delegation to the Games since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A total of 32 athletes, 22 men and 10 women, competed only in 11 sports. Fourteen athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including silver medalist Aigars Fadejevs in men's race walk, defending Olympic champion Igors Vihrovs in men's floor exercises, and judoka and bronze medalist Vsevolods Zeļonijs. Pistol shooter and former Olympic champion Afanasijs Kuzmins, the oldest of the team, at age 57, became the first Latvian athlete to compete in seven Olympic games (including three of his appearances under the Soviet Union). Meanwhile, javelin thrower and Latvia's top Olympic medal contender Vadims Vasiļevskis was appointed by the committee to become the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Latvia left Athens with a total of four Olympic silver medals, surpassing a single short of the overall tally from Sydney. Three of these medals were awarded to the athletes for the first time in men's javelin throw, modern pentathlon, and weightlifting. Gymnast Jevgēņijs Saproņenko claimed another sporting medal for his team with a silver in the men's vault exercises, adding it to a prestigious gold from Igors Vihrovs in Sydney four years earlier.
