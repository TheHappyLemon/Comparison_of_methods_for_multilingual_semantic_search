Gamasoidosis, also known as dermanyssosis, is a frequently unrecognized form of dermatitis, following human infestation with avian mites of the genera Dermanyssus or Ornithonyssus. It is characterized by pruritic erythematous papules, macules and urticaria, with itching and irritation resulting from the saliva the mites secrete while feeding. These bites are commonly found around the neck and areas covered by clothing, but can be found elsewhere on the body. The avian mite Dermanyssus gallinae can also infest various body parts, including the ear canal and scalp. Diagnosis is challenging due to the small size of the mites, requiring microscopic examination by a medical entomologist for species identification. Misdiagnosis is also common due to ignorance and misinformation among medical professionals, scientists and pest controllers. Gamasoidosis is linked to avian mites infesting residential, public and agricultural spaces, with a potential health threat due to the transmission of zoonotic pathogens by D. gallinae. Treatment involves eradicating mites from the environment, with resistance to pesticides posing a challenge. The condition's epidemiology raises concerns about its impact on public health, emphasizing the need for awareness, interdisciplinary collaboration, improved diagnostic tools and a "One Health" approach.
