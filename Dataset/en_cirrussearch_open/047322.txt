Oxyrhynchus (/ɒksɪˈrɪŋkəs/ ok-sih-RINK-əs; Greek: Ὀξύῤῥυγχος, translit. Oxýrrhynkhos, lit. "sharp-nosed", Koinē Greek: [okˈsyr̥r̥yŋkʰos]; Ancient Egyptian: Pr-mdjd; Coptic: ⲡⲉⲙϫⲉ or ⲡⲙ̅ϫⲏ, romanized: Pemdje), also known by its modern name Al-Bahnasa (Arabic: البهنسا, romanized: el-Bahnasa), is a city in Middle Egypt located about 160 km south-southwest of Cairo in Minya Governorate. It is also an important archaeological site. Since the late 19th century, the area around Oxyrhynchus has been excavated almost continually, yielding an enormous collection of papyrus texts dating from the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman Egypt. They also include a few vellum manuscripts, and more recent Arabic manuscripts on paper (for example, the medieval P. Oxy. VI 1006).
