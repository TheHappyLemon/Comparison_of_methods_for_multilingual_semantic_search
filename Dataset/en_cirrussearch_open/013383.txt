In the Roman Empire, it was the Year of the Consulship of Lamia and Servilius (or, less frequently, year 756 Ab urbe condita). The denomination "AD 3" for this year has been used since the early medieval period when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
