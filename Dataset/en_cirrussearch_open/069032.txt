Almaty (/ælˈmɑːti/ or /ˈælməti/; Kazakh: Алматы / Almaty, IPA: [ɑlmɑˈtə] ; Russian: Алматы, IPA: [ɐlmɐˈtɨ]), formerly known as Alma-Ata (Russian: Алма-Ата), is the largest city in Kazakhstan, with a population of over two million. It was the capital of Kazakhstan from 1929 to 1936, while the country was an autonomous republic of the Soviet Union, then from 1936 to 1991, a union republic and finally from 1991, an independent state. In 1997, the government relocated the capital to Akmola (now called Astana). Almaty is still the major commercial, financial, and cultural centre of Kazakhstan, as well as its most populous and most cosmopolitan city. The city is located in the mountainous area of southern Kazakhstan near the border with Kyrgyzstan in the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau at an elevation of 700–900 m (2,300–3,000 feet), where the Large and Small Almatinka rivers run into the plain. The city, just like Astana and Shymkent, does not belong to any region and is officially a "city of republican significance". The city has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of music since November 2017.
