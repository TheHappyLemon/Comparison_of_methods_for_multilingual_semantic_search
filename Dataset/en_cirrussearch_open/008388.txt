Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde (Swedish for Cape Waldemar), is a museum located on Djurgården in central Stockholm. The name is composed of Waldemar, an Old German noble male name, and udde, meaning cape. It is derived from a historical name of the island Djurgården, Valmundsö (see History of Djurgården.)
