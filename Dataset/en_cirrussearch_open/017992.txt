Mykolaiv (Ukrainian: Миколаїв, also referred to as Mykolayiv, Polish: Mikołajów) is a city in Stryi Raion, Lviv Oblast (region) in western Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Mykolaiv urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. The population is approximately 14,498 (2022 estimate). To distinguish Mykolaiv from the much larger southern city, the former is sometimes called Mykolaiv on Dniester (Ukrainian: Миколаїв над Дністром, Mykolaiv nad Dnistrom) after the major river it situated on (while the latter is located on the Southern Buh, another major river). The closest railway station is officially called Mykolaiv-Dnistrovskyi.
