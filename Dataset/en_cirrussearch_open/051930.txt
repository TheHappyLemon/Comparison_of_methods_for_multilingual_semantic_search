Vesijärvi is a lake of 111 square kilometres (43 sq mi) near Lahti in southern Finland. It suffered severe effects of eutrophication in the 1960s and a restoration programme began in the 1970s; by the start of the 2020s, the lake's water quality and ecosystem had significantly improved. The Enonselkä Basin is a part of Vesijärvi. The name of the lake means literally 'Water Lake'.
