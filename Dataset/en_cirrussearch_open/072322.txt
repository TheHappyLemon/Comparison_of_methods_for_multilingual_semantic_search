S/2003 J 9 is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003. S/2003 J 9 is about 1 kilometre in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 0.162 AU (24,200,000 km) in 767.60 days, at an inclination of 166.3° to the ecliptic (166° to Jupiter's equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.17. It belongs to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165°. This moon was once considered lost until November 2020, when the Minor Planet Center announced the recovery of S/2003 J 9 by Scott Sheppard in observations from September 2011 to April 2018.
