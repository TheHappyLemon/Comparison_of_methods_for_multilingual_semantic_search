Michael Richard Dawson (born 18 November 1983) is an English former professional footballer and sports pundit. As a player, he was a centre back. Dawson started his career at Nottingham Forest playing alongside veteran defender Des Walker before moving to Tottenham Hotspur with teammate Andy Reid for a fee of £8 million. While at Tottenham, Dawson won the League Cup in 2008. His form in the 2009–10 season saw him included in England's preliminary 2010 FIFA World Cup squad. Although he initially failed to make the final 23-man squad, an injury to captain Rio Ferdinand saw him drafted in as replacement. In August 2014, Hull City signed Dawson from Tottenham for a fee believed to be £3.5 million. Although relegated with Hull at the end of the 2014–15 season, he helped them return to the Premier League when they beat Sheffield Wednesday in the 2016 Championship play-off final. He returned to former club Nottingham Forest in May 2018. He is now a regular pundit on Sky Sports Soccer Saturday.
