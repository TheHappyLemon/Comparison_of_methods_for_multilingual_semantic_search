Hancock is a 2008 American satirical superhero film directed by Peter Berg from a screenplay by Vince Gilligan and Vy Vincent Ngo, co-produced by and starring Will Smith in the title role, along with Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman. The story was originally written by Vy Vincent Ngo in 1996. It languished in development hell for years with various directors attached, including Tony Scott, Michael Mann (who would later co-produce the film), Jonathan Mostow and Gabriele Muccino, before being filmed in 2007 in Los Angeles with a production budget of $150 million. In the United States, the film was rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America after changes were made at their request in order to avoid an R rating, which it had received twice before. The film was released on July 2, 2008, in the United States by Columbia Pictures. Hancock received mixed reviews from critics who praised its humor, performances, visual effects and premise, but criticized its execution and failure to deliver on its potential, especially during its second half. But over the years, it has gained a cult following. It grossed $629.4 million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2008.
