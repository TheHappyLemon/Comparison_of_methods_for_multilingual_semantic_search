The 1984–85 season of the European Cup club football tournament was overshadowed by the Heysel Stadium disaster that happened prior to the final match. That edition was won for the first time by Juventus in a 1–0 win against defending champions Liverpool. At sporting level, with this result they became the first club to have won all three major European trophies (European Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, and the Cup Winners' Cup), as well a posteriori as the one that needed the shortest amount of time to complete this (8 years). Following the disaster, English clubs received a five-year ban from entering any European competition, thus ending a period of great success for English clubs in the European Cup which had seen three clubs winning seven finals since 1977, including six successive finals up to 1982. Liverpool, English champions in 1989–90, were given an extra year's ban. There would be no English club to win the trophy until 1999, when Manchester United beat Bayern Munich 2–1.
