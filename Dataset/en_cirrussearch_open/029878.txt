Cher Lloyd (born 28 July 1993) is an English singer. She was the thirteenth contestant eliminated on the seventh series of the television talent show The X Factor in 2010. Following the show, Lloyd was signed to Syco Music in the United Kingdom and Epic Records in the United States. She released her debut studio album, Sticks and Stones, in 2011, which had two releases: its standard edition and a US version. The album peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart, while the latter version debuted at number nine in the US Billboard 200. It included the successful singles "Swagger Jagger", which entered at number one on the UK Singles Chart, "With Ur Love", and "Want U Back". Lloyd released her second studio album, Sorry I'm Late, in 2014, preceded by the lead single, "I Wish". The album failed to match the success of its predecessor, peaking at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart and number 12 on the Billboard 200. After a collaboration with singer Demi Lovato on the single "Really Don't Care", Lloyd had a two-year absence from the music industry. In July 2016, Lloyd released the single "Activated", which was described as a "memo of Cher to her fans to say she is back and she is stronger than ever". She released the singles "None of My Business" and "M.I.A." in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
