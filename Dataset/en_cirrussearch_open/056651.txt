Iultinsky District (Russian: Иу́льтинский райо́н; Chukchi: Ивылтин район, Ivyltin rajon) is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the six in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia. It is located in the northeast of the autonomous okrug and borders with the Chukchi Sea in the north, Providensky District in the east, Gulf of Anadyr in the southeast, and with Anadyrsky District in the southwest. The area of the district is 134,600 square kilometers (52,000 sq mi). Its administrative center is the urban locality (an urban-type settlement) of Egvekinot. Population: 4,329 (2010 Census); 3,974 (2002 Census); 15,689 (1989 Census). The population of Egvekinot accounts for 64.4% of the district's total population. The territory of the modern district has been populated since the Paleolithic age, though indigenous people are outnumbered by ethnic Russians by over three to one. The district was once a major center for mining tin and tungsten at Iultin, with the infrastructure built by gulag prisoners, but these mines have proved uneconomical in recent years and closed with their associated settlements abandoned.
