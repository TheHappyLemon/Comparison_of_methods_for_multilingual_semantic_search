The World Junior Figure Skating Championships, commonly referred to as "World Juniors" or "Junior Worlds", is an annual figure skating competition sanctioned by the International Skating Union in which figure skaters within a designated age range compete for the title of World Junior champion. The ISU guidelines for junior eligibility have varied throughout the years â€“ currently, skaters must be at least 13 years old but not yet 19 before the previous 1 July, except for men competing in pair skating and ice dancing where the age maximum is 21. This event is one of the four annual ISU figure skating Championships and is considered the most prestigious international competition for juniors. Medals are awarded in the disciplines of men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dancing.
