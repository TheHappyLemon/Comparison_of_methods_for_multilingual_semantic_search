Rafael Gordillo VÃ¡zquez (born 24 February 1957) is a Spanish retired footballer. A tremendously attacking left wing-back, equally at ease as defender and midfielder and with a good effort rate, he had an unmistakable style of playing with his socks down. He represented mainly Betis and Real Madrid during his career, appearing in 428 La Liga games and scoring 38 goals over 16 seasons. He won ten major titles with the latter club, including five national championships. Gordillo was a mainstay for the Spain national team in the 80s, appearing in 75 matches and representing the nation in five international tournaments.
