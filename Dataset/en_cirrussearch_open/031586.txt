Thelema (/θəˈliːmə/) is a Western esoteric and occult social or spiritual philosophy, as well as a new religious movement that was founded in the early 1900s by Aleister Crowley (1875–1947), an English writer, mystic, occultist, and ceremonial magician. Central to Thelema is the idea of discovering and following one's True Will, a unique purpose and calling that goes beyond ordinary desires. Crowley's system begins with The Book of the Law, a text he said was dictated to him by an entity named Aiwass. This foundational work lays out key principles, including the central axiom "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law". This principle emphasizes personal freedom and the pursuit of one's true path, while being guided by love and finding one's authentic purpose. The Thelemic cosmology features deities drawn from ancient Egyptian religion. The highest deity is Nuit, the night sky symbolized as a naked woman covered in stars, representing the ultimate source of possibilities. Hadit, the infinitely small point, represents manifestation and motion. Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a manifestation of Horus, embodies the Sun and active energies of Thelemic magick. True Will, a fundamental concept in Thelema, refers to an individual's unique purpose and calling. Crowley believed that discovering and following one's True Will is the path to self-realization and personal fulfillment, often referred to as the Great Work. Magick is a central practice in Thelema, encompassing a range of physical, mental, and spiritual exercises. It is viewed as a means to uncover one's True Will and enact change in alignment with it. Rituals, yoga, meditation, and other practices are used to explore consciousness and achieve self-mastery. The Gnostic Mass, a central ritual in Thelema, mirrors the structure of traditional religious services but communicates Thelemic principles. Thelemites also observe specific holy days, such as the Equinoxes and the Feast of the Three Days of the Writing of the Book of the Law, which commemorates the writing of Crowley's foundational text. Post-Crowley developments have further expanded Thelema's scope. Figures like Jack Parsons, Kenneth Grant, James Lees, and Nema Andahadna have contributed to the evolution of Thelema by introducing new ideas, practices, and interpretations. Parsons conducted the Babalon Working to invoke the goddess Babalon, while Grant synthesized various traditions into his Typhonian Order. Lees discovered the English Qaballa, and Nema Andahadna developed Maat Magick to transform humanity. These post-Crowley contributions have enriched Thelema's diversity and deepened its exploration of personal will, spiritual growth, and magical practices.
