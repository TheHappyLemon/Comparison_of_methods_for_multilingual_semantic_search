The metical (/ˈmɛtɪˌkæl/; plural: meticais) is the currency of Mozambique, abbreviated with the symbol MZN or MT. It is nominally divided into 100 centavos. The name metical comes from Arabic مثقال (mithqāl), a unit of weight and an alternative name for the gold dinar coin that was used throughout much of Africa until the 19th century.
