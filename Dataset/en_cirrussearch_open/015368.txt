The 2014 FIBA World Championship for Women, the 17th edition of FIBA's premier international tournament for women's national basketball teams, was held in Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey from 27 September to 5 October 2014. This tournament implemented the new expanded free throw lane, the restricted arc, and extended 3-point line (6.6–6.75 m). The United States defended their title and won their ninth overall gold medal by beating Spain 77–64 in the final.Australia defeated Turkey 74–44 to capture the bronze medal. This was the last FIBA championship to use the name of "FIBA World Championship for Women". Shortly after the event, FIBA changed the name of the competition to the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, presumably to align its name with that of the corresponding men's competition.
