Adriano Correia Claro (born 26 October 1984), known simply as Adriano, is a Brazilian former professional footballer. One of few players in professional football who are genuinely ambidextrous, he was capable of playing as a full-back or midfielder on both sides of the pitch. After starting his career with Coritiba, he moved to Spain in 2005, going on to spend several seasons in La Liga with Sevilla and Barcelona and win several major titles with both clubs, including the treble with the latter in 2015. A Brazilian international for ten years, Adriano represented his country in two Copa Am√©rica tournaments, winning the 2004 edition.
