The 2017 Tour de Romandie was a road cycling stage race that took place between 25 and 30 April in Romandie, Switzerland. It was the 71st edition of the Tour de Romandie and the nineteenth event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. The race was won on the final day by Australia's Richie Porte (BMC Racing Team), who overhauled a 19-second deficit to British rider Simon Yates over the 17.88-kilometre (11.11 mi) time trial, and won the race for the first time. Yates – riding for the Orica–Scott squad – was able to finish second overall, holding off LottoNL–Jumbo's Primož Roglič of Slovenia, who won the final time trial and finished just five seconds in arrears of Yates at the finish. In the race's other classifications, Belgian Sander Armée won the mountains classification for the second year in succession for Lotto–Soudal, home rider Stefan Küng won the points classification for the BMC Racing Team, while 14th place overall was enough for Pierre Latour (AG2R La Mondiale) to win the young rider classification.
