Formally the club was established as HK Vilki in 2000, but the roots of the team date back to a team called AK-2, founded in Riga in 1987. The owner of the club during its stay in Ozolnieki was 7-time NHL All-star defenseman Sandis Ozoliņš. The team folded before the start of the 2014–15 Latvian Hockey League season.
