The Caelifera are a suborder of orthopteran insects. They include the grasshoppers and grasshopper-like insects, as well as other superfamilies classified with them: the ground-hoppers (Tetrigoidea) and pygmy mole crickets (Tridactyloidea). The latter should not be confused with the mole crickets (Gryllotalpidae), which belong to the other Orthopteran sub-order Ensifera. The name of this suborder comes from Latin meaning chisel-bearing ("chisel" in Latin: caelum), referring to the "stout" shape of its species' ovipositors.
