Corythucha ciliata, the sycamore lace bug, is a species of lace bug in the family Tingidae that is associated with sycamore trees. It originates in the New World, but has been introduced and has spread in Europe. It is a small, whitish insect and feeds on the underside of the leaves, sucking sap. There are reports in Europe of C. cilata landing on people and biting them. Reports from Italy, France and Romania indicate that some people experience adverse reactions, e.g., dermatosis.
