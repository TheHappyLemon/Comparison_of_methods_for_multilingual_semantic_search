Bangabandhu National Stadium (Bengali: বঙ্গবন্ধু জাতীয় স্টেডিয়াম), formerly known as the Dhaka Stadium, is a multipurpose sports arena and the national stadium of Bangladesh. Located in the Motijheel area of Dhaka, it is predominantly used for football matches and serves as the home venue for the Bangladesh national football team. The stadium is well known for hosting a high-profile international friendly between Argentina and Nigeria in 2011. The stadium has undergone multiple renovations. Prior to the refurbishment for the opening ceremony of the 2011 Cricket World Cup, its capacity was nearly 55,000. Despite its reduced capacity of 36,000 after renovation, it remains the largest stadium in Bangladesh. The current name, bestowed to honor Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the nation and also known as "Bangabandhu" or "Friend of Bengal," adds a significant historical touch.
