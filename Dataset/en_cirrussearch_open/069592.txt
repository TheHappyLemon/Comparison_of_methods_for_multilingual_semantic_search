Lamon Bay is a large bay in the southern part of Luzon island in the Philippines. It is a body of water connecting the southern part of Quezon province to the Philippine Sea, a marginal sea of the Pacific Ocean. It borders on the coastal towns of Atimonan, Gumaca, Plaridel, Lopez, Calauag, and the islands of Alabat. It is a rich fishing ground and the home of various living corals. Most parts of the bay consist of gray sand, some parts are filled with rocks, and other living corals. It is gradually sloping to the extent that, during low tide, the water level is low enough to allow one to walk as far as five hundred metres from the shore like in Pulong Pasig of Calauag. The beaches in the towns of Gumaca and Plaridel are sandy and ideal for swimming.[according to whom?]. White-sand beaches are found in the villages of Capaluhan, Santo Angel, Talingting, Pangahoy, and Dapdap of Calauag. In some parts of the bay, about ten feet from the beach front, are living corals. The town of Lopez has colonies of corals[according to whom?] which are located just about 15 minutes by boat from the shore. Lamon Bay is located at the southern part of Quezon.
