Dobele District (Latvian: Dobeles rajons) was an administrative division of Latvia, located in the Courland and Semigallia regions, in the country's centre. It was organized into two cities, a municipality and fifteen parishes, each with a local government authority. The main city in the district was Dobele. Districts were eliminated during the administrative-territorial reform in 2009.
