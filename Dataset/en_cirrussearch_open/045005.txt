Remco Evenepoel (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrɛmkoː ˈeːvənəpu:l]; born 25 January 2000) is a Belgian professional cyclist who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Soudal–Quick-Step. He is the son of Patrick Evenepoel, a former racing cyclist who won the 1993 Grand Prix de Wallonie. Remco Evenepoel started his sport career in association football, playing for the youth teams of R.S.C. Anderlecht and PSV Eindhoven, as well as being featured in the youth national teams of Belgium. Realising that his physical abilities made him more suited for cycling, he switched to the discipline in 2017. After winning the road race and time trial in the junior categories at the 2018 UCI Road World Championships, Evenepoel turned professional with Deceuninck–Quick-Step, skipping the under-23 rank. Evenepoel won the 2022 Vuelta a España and the 2022 UCI World Road Race Championships two weeks later.
