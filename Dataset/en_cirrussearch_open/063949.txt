Greatest Hits is a posthumous double-disc greatest hits album by American rapper 2Pac, released by Amaru Entertainment, Death Row Records, Interscope Records, and Jive Records on November 24, 1998. The album's non-chronological sequence focuses on the highlights of 2Pac's career. 21 of his tracks are accompanied by four previously unreleased songs: "God Bless the Dead", "Unconditional Love", "Troublesome '96", and "Changes". Some tracks have alternate mixes, while the original mix of "California Love" makes its first proper album appearance after initially only being available as a single. "Changes" earned 2Pac the first and only posthumous Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance. This is one of two 2Pac releases—and one of only nine hip hop albums—to have been certified Diamond in the United States.
