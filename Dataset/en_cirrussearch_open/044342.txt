The dalasi is the currency of the Gambia that was adopted in 1971. It is subdivided into 100 bututs. It replaced the Gambian pound at a rate of 1 pound = 5 dalasis, i.e. 1 dalasi = 0.2 pound = 4 shillings. The derivative of dala is unknown. In numerous languages in the Francophonie, currency terms (including batut, dalasi, doromi, teemer) refer to the former 5 French West African franc note (the lowest denomination at the time), but to which the origins are not known. One speculated origin is a pronunciation of "dollar"; however, variants of dalasi in other Mandinka dialects (such as daasi) counter this speculation while butut is from Wolof butuut, "small thing". As a result of inflation, now bututs coins have completely disappeared from circulation and the minimum monetary unit has become 50 Butut.[citation needed]
