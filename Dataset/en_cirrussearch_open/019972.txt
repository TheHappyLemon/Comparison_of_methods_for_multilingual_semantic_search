Graham Island (Haida: X̱aaydag̱a Gwaay.yaay linag̱waay in X̱ayda Kil) is the largest island in the Haida Gwaii archipelago (previously known as the Queen Charlotte Islands), lying off the mainland coast of British Columbia, Canada. It is separated by the narrow Skidegate Channel from the other principal island of the group to the south, Moresby Island (T'aaxwii X̱aaydag̱a Gwaay.yaay linag̱waay in the language of the Haida people). It has a population of 3,858 (2016 census), an area of 6,361 km2 (2,456 sq mi), and is the 101st largest island in the world and Canada's 22nd largest island. Graham Island was named in 1853 by James Charles Prevost, commander of HMS Virago, for Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet, who was First Lord of the Admiralty at the time.
