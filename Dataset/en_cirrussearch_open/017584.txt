The 2000 Brazilian Grand Prix (officially the XXIX Grande Prêmio Marlboro do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 March 2000 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in São Paulo, Brazil. The race, which was the second round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the 29th Brazilian Grand Prix, drew 72,000 spectators. Michael Schumacher, a Ferrari driver, won the 71-lap race after starting third. Benetton's Giancarlo Fisichella finished second, and Jordan's Heinz-Harald Frentzen was third. McLaren's Mika Häkkinen qualified on pole position and led the first lap of the race before being passed by World Drivers' Championship leader Michael Schumacher on lap two. Following that, Michael Schumacher built a 17.6-second lead before making the first of two pit stops for fuel and tyres on lap 20. After Häkkinen retired with a shortage of engine oil pressure ten laps later, he retook the lead. In the final 12 laps, David Coulthard in the other McLaren gained on Michael Schumacher as the latter slowed to manage an oil pressure problem. He was not close enough to make a pass for the win and Michael Schumacher took his second consecutive victory of the season and the 37th of his career. Following the race, Coulthard was disqualified from second place due to an illegal front wing endplate. McLaren submitted an appeal with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile's International Court of Appeal, which was denied. The disqualification moved every driver behind Coulthard forward by a single position. The result extended Michael Schumacher's lead atop the World Drivers' Championship to 12 points. Fisichella moved from fifth to second as Rubens Barrichello in the second Ferrari fell to third after not finishing the race. Ferrari further increased their lead in the World Constructors' Championship to 18 points as Benetton advanced from fourth to second with fifteen races remaining in the season.
