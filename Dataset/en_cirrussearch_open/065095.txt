Angammedilla National Park (Sinhala: අංගම්මැඩිල්ල ජාතික වනෝද්‍යානය, romanized: Aṁgammæḍilla Jātika Vanōdyānaya; Tamil: அங்கம்மெடில்லை தேசிய வனம், romanized: Aṅkam'meṭillai Tēciya Vaṉam) is one of the new national parks in Sri Lanka. The region was designated national park on 6 June 2006. Originally Angammedilla was a forest reserve within the Minneriya-Girithale Sanctuary declared on 12 February 1988. The park is declared mainly to protect the drainage basin of Parakrama Samudra. Angammedilla also secures the drainage basins of Minneriya and Girithale irrigation tanks, water sources in Sudu Kanda (Sinhala for "White hill") and habitats and wildlife of the adjacent forests. It is located 225 kilometres (140 mi) away from Colombo in Polonnaruwa District.
