The incident in fact consisted of three separate nearly simultaneously launched attacks on Latvian border posts by Soviet forces at the early dawn of June 15, 1940. Two border posts were actually attacked while another already ongoing attack was suspended. As a result, 3 border guards and 2 civilians were killed; 37 were kidnapped and brought to the USSR as hostages.
