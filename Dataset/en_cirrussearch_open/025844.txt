Guldpucken (The Golden Puck) is awarded annually to the ice hockey player of the year in Sweden. It is similar to the NHL's Hart Memorial Trophy. Originally it was awarded to a player in the Swedish hockey system, the top-level ice hockey league in Sweden. Starting with the 2014-2015 season the award began being awarded to players in the NHL who were of Swedish nationality. It should not be confused with Guldhjälmen (The Golden Helmet), the award for the most valuable player according to the players in the SHL. Erik Karlsson has won the award a record of three times, and is the only player to ever do so. The award has been won twice by four other players: Anders Andersson, Leif Holmqvist, Peter Forsberg and Victor Hedman. The sculpture Guldpucken is made by the Swedish artist Rune Hannäs.
