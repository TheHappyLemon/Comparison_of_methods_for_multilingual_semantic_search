Murans also had an opportunity to represent Latvia at the 2004 Summer Olympics, finishing fifty-first in the 100-metre breaststroke. Murans qualified for the men's 100 m breaststroke at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by eclipsing a FINA B-standard entry time of 1:04.95 from the Croatian Open Championships in Rijeka. He challenged seven other swimmers on the second heat, including three-time Olympians Jean Luc Razakarivony of Madagascar and Yevgeny Petrashov of Kyrgyzstan.

Murans failed to advance into the semifinals, as he placed fifty-first overall on the first day of preliminaries.
