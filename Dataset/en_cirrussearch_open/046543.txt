The 2019 UCI World Tour was a series of races that included thirty-eight road cycling events throughout the 2019 men's cycling season. It was the first time since the World Tour was launched by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 2009 that it was not a ranking competition in its own right. The tour started with the opening stage of the Tour Down Under on 15 January and concluded with the final stage of the Tour of Guangxi on 22 October.
