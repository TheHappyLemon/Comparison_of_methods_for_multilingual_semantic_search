Micheal Ray Stevenson (born November 19, 1989), known professionally as Tyga (/ˈtaɪɡə/; a backronym for Thank You God Always), is an American rapper from Gardena, California. After a number of independent releases, he signed a recording contract with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment, an imprint of Cash Money Records and Republic Records in 2008. His major label debut, Careless World: Rise of the Last King (2012) peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and saw generally positive critical reception. It spawned the Billboard Hot 100-top 40 singles "Rack City" and "Faded" (featuring Lil Wayne). His third album, Hotel California (2013) was met with trailing critical and commercial response, along with his collaborative album, Fan of a Fan: The Album (2015) with singer Chris Brown. Due to disagreements with Young Money, Tyga's fourth album, The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty was released independently in June 2015. Executive-produced by Kanye West, it became his lowest-selling album to that point with estimated sales of 5,000 album equivalent units in its first week. His fifth and sixth albums, BitchImTheShit2 (2017) and Kyoto (2018) were met with continued stagnation. Following this, his May 2018 single, "Taste" (featuring Offset) marked a brief period of commercial resurgence, peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming his first top 40 single since "Ayo" (with Chris Brown) in 2015. It served as lead single and preceded the release of his seventh album, Legendary (2019).
