The Edessa Waterfalls or Edessis Waterfalls (Greek: Καταρράκτες της Έδεσσας) are located in Edessa city in Macedonia, Greece. The falls are a natural phenomenon that arose after a strong earthquake that struck the surrounding area in the 14th century. Since then, many changes have taken place in their morphology due to earthquakes of smaller scale. The main source of these waterfalls is the wetland of Agra-Nissiou, from which flows the main river, Edessaios. Edessaios branches are the waterfalls. Furthermore, the Geopark of the Falls spreads over an area of over 100,000sqm and on a path on the rock for 1.1 km. The waterfalls are the main attraction of visitors to Edessa. There are twelve waterfalls in the area, of which four are easily visible. The paths of the Waterfall Park include the stone-paved path to Ancient Edessa through the plain of the city. This passage was a part of the ancient Egnatia road linking Ancient Edessa, the Acropolis of Edessa (Varosi district) and Thessaloniki until the beginning of the 20th century.
