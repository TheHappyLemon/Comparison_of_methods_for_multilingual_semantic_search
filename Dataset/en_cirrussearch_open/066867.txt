Spergularia marina, also called Spergularia salina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae (the pink family). It is known as salt sandspurry or lesser sea-spurrey. S. marina is a sprawling annual or sometimes perennial, with stems up to 35 cm (14 in) long. Like other sea-spurrey species, its flowers have white to pink petals, with sepals usually longer than the petals, at 2.5–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in). Plants are salt-tolerant, being found by the sea and in saline areas inland.
