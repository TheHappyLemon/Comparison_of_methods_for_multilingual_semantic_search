The national symbols of North Macedonia, as stated in the constitution, are the coat of arms, the flag and the anthem. After the independence of North Macedonia from Yugoslavia, the country made some changes in the national symbols. The flag was changed two times and today's flag includes an eight-ray sun on a red background, while the coat of arms from the Socialist Republic of Macedonia was retained, except the red star which was removed.
