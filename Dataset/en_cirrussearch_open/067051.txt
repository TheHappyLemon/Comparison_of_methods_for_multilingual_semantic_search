The Pakistan national football team (Urdu: پاکستان کی قومی فٹ بال ٹیم) represents Pakistan in men's international football in FIFA-authorized events and is controlled by the Pakistan Football Federation, the governing body for football in Pakistan. Pakistan became a member of FIFA in 1948 joining the Asian Football Confederation and its national team debuted in 1950. Pakistan contests the South Asian Football Federation Championship and South Asian Games, which alternate biennially. Pakistan's football team has won gold at the South Asian Games in 1989, 1991, 2004 and 2006. Pakistan has never qualified for any major tournament outside the South Asian region. Football has struggled to gain popularity in Pakistan largely due to the heavy influence of cricket in South Asia.
