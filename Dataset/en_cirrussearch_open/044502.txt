This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves. In chess, fool's mate is the checkmate delivered after the fewest possible moves from the game's starting position. It arises from the following moves, or similar: 1. f3 e6 2. g4?? Qh4# The mate can be achieved in two moves only by Black, giving checkmate on the second move with the queen. Fool's mate received its name because it can occur only if White commits an extraordinary blunder. Black can be mated in an analogous way, although this requires an additional move, with White's queen delivering checkmate on the third move. Even among rank beginners, this checkmate rarely occurs in practice. The mate is an illustration of the kingside weakness shared by both players along the f- and g-files during the opening phase of the game. A player may also suffer an early checkmate if the f- and g-pawns are advanced prematurely and the kingside is not properly defended, as shown in historical miniature games recorded in chess literature.
