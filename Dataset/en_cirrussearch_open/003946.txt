Tarsius is a genus of tarsiers, small primates native to islands of Southeast Asia. Until 2010, all tarsier species were typically assigned to this genus, but a revision of the family Tarsiidae restored the generic status of Cephalopachus and created a new genus Carlito. All members of Tarsius are found on Sulawesi, while Cephalopachus is found on Sundaland and Carlito in Greater Mindanao.
