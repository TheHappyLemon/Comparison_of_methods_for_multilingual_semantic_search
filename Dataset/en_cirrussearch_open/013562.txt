Fable Heroes is a beat 'em up video game in the Fable series, developed by Lionhead Studios and published by Microsoft Studios for Xbox 360. Announced at the 2012 Xbox Spring Showcase, it was released on 2 May that year as part of the Xbox Live Arcade Next Promotion. It is the first "family-friendly" game in the Fable series. Lead designer Ted Timmins described how the team "brought a modern touch to the old and out dated side scroller". He also mentioned that Fable Heroes would connect with Fable: The Journey. By completing tasks in Fable Heroes the player will gain access to unique items in Fable: The Journey and vice versa. Additional avatar awards are also available in-game.
