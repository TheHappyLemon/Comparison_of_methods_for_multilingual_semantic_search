Cork City Football Club (Irish: Cumann Peile Chathair Chorca√≠) is an Irish association football club based in Cork. The club was founded and elected to the League of Ireland in 1984. It was one of the first clubs in Ireland (and the first in Cork) to field a team of professional footballers. With the progression of professionalism at the club, continued development of the Turners Cross stadium and the transition to summer football, the club became one of the biggest and best supported clubs in the country. In a survey published in 2020, the club was the highest supported League of Ireland (LOI) club. Cork City won its third LOI Premier Division title, and first FAI Cup double, during the 2017 season. While the club were 2022 LOI First Division champions and were promoted to the top tier for the 2023 League of Ireland Premier Division season, after a play-off defeat they dropped back to the LOI First Division for the 2024 season. The club's traditional colours are green and white with red trim, and the crest is a variant of the Cork coat of arms. City's home games are played at Turners Cross.
