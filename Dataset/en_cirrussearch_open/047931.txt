Green Ukraine, also known as Zelenyi Klyn (Ukrainian: Зелений клин, romanized: Zelenyi Klyn, Russian: Зелёный Клин, romanized: Zelyonyy Klin, literally: 'the green gore/wedge') or Zakytaishchyna (Ukrainian and Russian: Закитайщина, Ukrainian romanization: Zakytaishchyna, Russian romanization: Zakitayshchina, literally: 'Trans China'), is a historical Ukrainian name for the land in the Russian Far East area between the Amur River and the Pacific Ocean, an area roughly corresponding to Outer Manchuria. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Transcathay (Ukrainian: Закитайщина, romanized: Zakytaishchyna) was a projected country in the Russian Far East. After the establishment of the Bolshevik Far Eastern Republic on April 6, 1920, Far Eastern areas with an ethnic Ukrainian majority attempted to secede and establish an entity called Green Ukraine. This movement quickly proved abortive. Geographically, Green Ukraine borders the present-day North Korea, in the special city of Rason and the Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin.
