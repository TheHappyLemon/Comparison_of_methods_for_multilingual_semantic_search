The Caucasian Imamate, also known as the North Caucasus Imamate (Arabic: إمامة شمال القوقاز, romanized: Imāmat Shamal al Qawqāz), was a state established by the imams in Dagestan and Chechnya during the early-to-mid 19th century in the North Caucasus, to fight against the Russian Empire during the Caucasian War, where Russia sought to conquer the Caucasus in order to secure communications with its new territories south of the mountains.
