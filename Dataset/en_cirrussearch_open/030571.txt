The Blackmarâ€“Diemer Gambit (or BDG) is a chess opening characterized by the moves: 1. d4 d5 2. e4 dxe4 3. Nc3 where White intends to follow up with f3, usually on the fourth move. White obtains a tempo and a half-open f-file in return for a pawn, and as with most gambits, White aims to achieve rapid development and active posting of their pieces in order to rapidly build up an attack at the cost of the gambit pawn. It is one of the few gambits available to White after 1.d4. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
