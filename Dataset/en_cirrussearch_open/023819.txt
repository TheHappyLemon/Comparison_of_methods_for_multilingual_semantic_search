The Pyrenees (/pɪrɪˈniːz/; Spanish: Pirineos [piɾiˈneos]; French: Pyrénées [piʁene] ; Catalan: Pirineu [piɾiˈnɛw]; Basque: Pirinioak [piɾini.o.ak]; Occitan: Pirenèus [piɾeˈnɛws]; Aragonese: Pirineus) are a mountain range straddling the border of France and Spain. They extend nearly 500 km (310 mi) from their union with the Cantabrian Mountains to Cap de Creus on the Mediterranean coast, reaching a maximum altitude of 3,404 metres (11,168 ft) at the peak of Aneto. For the most part, the main crest forms a divide between Spain and France, with the microstate of Andorra sandwiched in between. Historically, the Crown of Aragon and the Kingdom of Navarre extended on both sides of the mountain range.
