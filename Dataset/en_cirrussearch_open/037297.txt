Foundation Fieldbus H1 is one of the FOUNDATION fieldbus protocol versions. Foundation H1 (31.25 kbit/s) is a bi-directional communications protocol used for communications among field devices and to the control system. It utilizes either twisted pair, or fiber media to communicate between multiple nodes (devices) and the controller. The controller requires only one communication point to communicate with up to 32 nodes, this is a significant improvement over the standard 4–20 mA communication method which requires a separate connection point for each communication device on the controller system. The Foundation Fieldbus H1 has support for Intrinsically Safe Wiring. Unlike other protocols, FOUNDATION H1 provides explicit synchronization of control and communication for precisely periodic (isochronous) communication and execution of control functions with minimized dead time and jitter. It synchronizes clocks in fieldbus devices for support of Function Block scheduling and alarm time-stamping at the point of detection. The original concept was to connect as many fields devices as possible on controller field connection, limited only by signal strength.
