EML Kindral Kurvits is a Kurvits-class multi-purpose patrol vessel. Built in 2012 by Uki Workboat. At the beginning of 2023, four larger ships of Police and Border Guard Board, including Kindral Kurvits, were transferred to Estonian Navy. This improved responsiveness in the Estonian maritime area and provided Estonia with a better defense capability.
