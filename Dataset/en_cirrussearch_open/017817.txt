In combinatorial mathematics, the Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively defined objects. They are named after the French-Belgian mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan. The n-th Catalan number can be expressed directly in terms of the central binomial coefficients by Cn=1n+1(2nn)=(2n)!(n+1)!n!=∏k=2nn+kkfor n≥0.{\displaystyle C_{n}={\frac {1}{n+1}}{2n \choose n}={\frac {(2n)!}{(n+1)!\,n!}}=\prod \limits _{k=2}^{n}{\frac {n+k}{k}}\qquad {\text{for }}n\geq 0.} The first Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, 16796, 58786, ... (sequence A000108 in the OEIS).
