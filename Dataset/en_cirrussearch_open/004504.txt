Tomás Robredo Garcés, known as Tommy Robredo (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈtomi roˈβɾeðo ɣaɾˈθes], Catalan: [ɡəɾˈses]; born 1 May 1982), is a Spanish former professional tennis player. His career-high singles ranking was world No. 5, which he reached in August 2006 as a result of winning the Hamburg Masters earlier in the year. Robredo reached the quarterfinals at seven singles major tournaments. He was also a three-time semifinalist at the US Open men's doubles tournament, and a semifinalist at the Australian Open in mixed doubles. Robredo turned professional in 1998 and was coached by José Manuel "Pepo" Clavet and then by Karim Perona. Robredo considered his forehand to be his best shot, and red clay his favorite surface. He remains the only player in Open Era history to mount three consecutive comebacks from two sets down, a feat achieved en route to the quarterfinals of the 2013 French Open. He has one of the highest percentages of five-set matches won with 77.3 per cent (17–5 win–loss record).
