Naked Gun 33+1⁄3: The Final Insult is a 1994 American crime comedy film directed by Peter Segal (in his directorial debut) and written by Pat Proft, David Zucker (who also directed the previous two films in the series) and Robert LoCash. The film is the third and final installment in The Naked Gun film series, which was based on the television series Police Squad!. The Final Insult is the only film in the series that is not directed by David Zucker, with him serving as producer and co-writer instead. Police Squad! co-creators Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker returned as executive producers. The "33+1⁄3" in the title is a reference to the number of revolutions per minute at which long playing (LP) phonograph records play. The film was originally going to be titled The Naked Gun 33+1⁄3: Just for the Record, but was changed after the studio felt that audiences would not get the joke. It was also titled The Naked Gun 3: The Final Insult in some Christmas 1993 video previews.[citation needed] Leslie Nielsen returns as Lieutenant Frank Drebin (his original character from Police Squad!), along with Priscilla Presley as Jane Spencer Drebin, O. J. Simpson (in his last film before the notorious murders and his subsequent trial) as Officer Nordberg, and George Kennedy as Captain Ed Hocken. Newcomers to the series Fred Ward, Anna Nicole Smith, and Kathleen Freeman co-star as a gang of bombers set to blow up the Academy Awards ceremony. Raye Birk reprises his role as the villainous Pahpshmir from The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!.
