Kamensk crater is an impact crater located 10 to 15 kilometres (6.2 to 9.3 mi) to the south of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky town in Rostov Oblast, Russia. It is 25 km (16 mi) in diameter and the age is estimated to be 49.0 ± 0.2 million years old (Eocene). The crater is not exposed at the surface. It may have formed at the same time as the smaller and nearby Gusev crater.
