Yuzhne (Ukrainian: Ю́жне, pronounced [ˈjuʒne]; formerly Южний, romanized: Yuzhnyi, lit. 'southern' n. adj. in Russian) is a port city in Odesa Raion, Odesa Oblast (province) of south-western Ukraine. Yuzhne hosts the administration of Yuzhne urban hromada [uk], one of the hromadas of Ukraine. It is situated on the country's Black Sea coast. Population: 32,677 (2022 estimate). Initially created as a settlement of the Odesa Portside Plant in the Small Adzhalyk Estuary, since 1981 it was transformed into a suburb of Odesa within the Suvorovsky District of the city. From the Southern Marine Terminal of the city port, the Odesa–Brody pipeline takes its beginning towards the Western Ukraine. Until 18 July 2020, Yuzhne was incorporated as a city of oblast significance. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Odesa Oblast to seven, the city of Yuzhne was merged into newly established Odesa Raion. The city's port Pivdennyi (formerly Yuzhnyi) is an internationally important oil terminal, and one of Ukraine's top three ports, with Odesa and Chornomorsk. These three nearby port cities have grown into a single conurbation, and Yuzhne is considered a satellite of Odesa.
