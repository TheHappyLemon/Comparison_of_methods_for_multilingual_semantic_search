Vytautas (c. 1350 – 27 October 1430), also known as Vytautas the Great (Lithuanian: Vytautas Didysis, Belarusian: Вітаўт, Vitaŭt, Polish: Witold Kiejstutowicz, Witold Aleksander or Witold Wielki, Ukrainian: Вітовт (Vitovt), Ruthenian: Витовт (Vitovt), Latin: Alexander Vitoldus, Old German: Wythaws or Wythawt) from the late 14th century onwards, was a ruler of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He was also the prince of Grodno (1370–1382), prince of Lutsk (1387–1389), and the postulated king of the Hussites. In modern Lithuania, Vytautas is revered as a national hero and was an important figure in the national rebirth in the 19th century. Vytautas is a popular male given name in Lithuania. In commemoration of the 500-year anniversary of his death, Vytautas Magnus University was named after him. Monuments in his honour were built in many towns in independent Lithuania during the interwar period from 1918 to 1939. It is known that Vytautas himself knew and spoke the Lithuanian language with Jogaila.
