Leeds Cathedral, formally the Cathedral Church of St Anne, commonly known as Saint Anne's Cathedral, is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leeds, and is the seat of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds. It is in the city of Leeds, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom. The city of Leeds does not have a Church of England cathedral although it is in the Anglican Diocese of Leeds. The cathedrals of the Anglican diocese are in Ripon, Wakefield and Bradford. The city instead has a Minster which is similar to nearby Dewsbury Minster and Halifax Minster, all of which are parish churches. The original cathedral was located in St Anne's Church in 1878, but that building was demolished around 1900. The current cathedral building on Cookridge Street was completed in 1904, and was restored in 2006. The reredos of the old cathedral's high altar was designed by Pugin in 1842 and moved to the lady chapel of the new cathedral. The cathedral is a Grade II* listed building.
