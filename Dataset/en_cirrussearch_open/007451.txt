He was the first European-born goaltender to be drafted in the NHL Entry Draft and the first to achieve success in North America. Lindbergh died at age 26 in a single-car accident five months after leading the Flyers to the 1985 Stanley Cup Finals and winning the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goaltender.
