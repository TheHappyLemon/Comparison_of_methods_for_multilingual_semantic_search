Siversk (Ukrainian: Сі́верськ, IPA: [ˈs⁽ʲ⁾i.wersʲk]; Russian: Се́верск, romanized: Seversk), formerly known as Yama (Я́ма) until 1973, is a small city in Bakhmut Raion, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. Its economy has traditionally been based around the mining and processing of dolomite. In January 2022, it had an estimated population of 10,875. During the Russo-Ukrainian War, it has been a site of repeated fighting, accelerating the economic and demographic downturn the city has suffered since the 1990s. The 2022 battle of Siversk during the Russian invasion of Ukraine has destroyed much of the city, and only about 1,000 people remain in the city as of July 2023. It is the administrative center of Siversk urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine.
