Tylopoda (meaning "calloused foot") is a suborder of terrestrial herbivorous even-toed ungulates belonging to the order Artiodactyla. They are found in the wild in their native ranges of South America and Asia, while Australian feral camels are introduced. The group has a long fossil history in North America and Eurasia. Tylopoda appeared during the Eocene around 50 million years ago. Tylopoda has only one extant family, Camelidae, which includes camels, llamas, guanacos, alpacas and vicu√±as. This group was much more diverse in the past, containing a number of extinct families in addition to the ancestors of living camelids (see below). Tylopods are not ruminants.
