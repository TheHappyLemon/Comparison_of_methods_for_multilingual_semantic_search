Tarvagatai Nuruu National Park (Mongolian: Тарвагатай Нуруу) covers the southwestern sector of the Tarvagatai Range of the Khangai Mountains in central Mongolia. The park is remote, protecting a transition zone between semi-arid steppe to the south and coniferous forests on the northern slope of the range. A large fire burned a significant part of the park in 2002, including 800 square kilometres (310 sq mi) of forest, mostly larch and siberian pine. The park is located about 60 km northeast of Uliastai, in the eastern region of Zavkhan Province.
