Hsieh Su-wei (Chinese: 謝淑薇; pinyin: Xiè Shúwéi; pronounced [ɕjê sǔ wěɪ]; born 4 January 1986) is a Taiwanese professional tennis player. On 25 February 2013, she reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 23, and on 12 May 2014, she reached world No. 1 in the doubles rankings. Hsieh has won three singles and 34 doubles titles on the WTA Tour, one WTA 125 doubles title, 27 singles and 23 doubles titles on the ITF Circuit, seven medals at the Asian Games (2 gold, 3 silver, and 2 bronze), one gold and one bronze medal at the 2005 Summer Universiade, and has amassed over $10 million in prize money. She has spent a total of 47 weeks with the top doubles ranking, the longest tenure by a tennis player from East Asia. Hsieh is the highest-ranked Taiwanese player in history, in both singles and doubles. Known for playing with two hands on both sides, flat and quick groundstrokes, crafty gameplay, aggressive volleys, and unorthodox variety of shots, Hsieh is regarded as one of the more successful and versatile doubles players in history. She has won eight Grand Slam titles in doubles, claiming the 2013 Wimbledon Championships and the 2014 French Open with Peng Shuai (with whom she also won the 2013 WTA Championships), the 2019 and 2023 Wimbledon Championships with Barbora Strýcová, the 2021 Wimbledon Championships and the 2024 Australian Open with Elise Mertens, and the 2023 French Open with Wang Xinyu. Hsieh and Strýcová also were the runners-up at both the 2019 WTA Finals and the 2020 Australian Open. She also reached the quarterfinals in doubles at the 2012 London Olympics with compatriot Chuang Chia-jung. While primarily known for her doubles prowess, Hsieh also found success on the singles tour. Most of her singles success came on hardcourts, where she won all three of her WTA Tour titles, as well as reached the quarterfinals at the Australian Open in 2021, a Premier 5 semifinal at Dubai in 2019, and a Premier Mandatory quarterfinal at the Miami Open in 2019 (defeating world No. 1, Naomi Osaka, in the third round). She has also been successful on other surfaces, including reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2018 (defeating world No. 1, Simona Halep, in the third round) and the third round of the French Open in 2017. Hsieh has recorded singles victories over several top 15, top 10 and top 5 players. Hsieh is the first Taiwanese woman to reach a major singles quarterfinal, which she achieved at the 2021 Australian Open. At 35, she became the oldest debutant Grand Slam quarterfinalist. Upon her retirement from singles in 2024, commentators reflected on Hsieh's time in the sport as "a killer on the court [who] can produce shots that defy geometry and the laws of physics" while also being deeply respected by her colleagues and a charming presence on the tour.
