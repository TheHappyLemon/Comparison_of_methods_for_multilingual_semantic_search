Marion Lois Jones (born October 12, 1975), also known as Marion Jones-Thompson, is an American former world champion track-and-field athlete and former professional basketball player. She won three gold medals and two bronze medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, but was later stripped of her medals after admitting to steroid use. Jones was one of the most famous athletes to be linked to the BALCO scandal. The performance-enhancing substance usage scandal covered more than 20 top-level athletes, including Jones's ex-husband, shot putter C.J. Hunter, and 100Â m sprinter Tim Montgomery, the father of Jones's first child. Jones has also played professional basketball in the Women's National Basketball Association, as point guard in the team of Tulsa Shock between 2010 and 2011.
