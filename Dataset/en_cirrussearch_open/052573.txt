This timeline of United States government military operations, based in part on reports by the Congressional Research Service, shows the years and places in which U.S. military units participated in armed conflicts or occupation of foreign territories. Items in bold are wars most often considered to be major conflicts by historians and the general public. Note that instances where the U.S. government gave aid alone, with no military personnel involvement, are excluded, as are Central Intelligence Agency operations. In domestic peacetime disputes such as riots and labor issues, only operations undertaken by active duty personnel (aka "federal troops" or "U.S. military") are depicted in this article; state defense forces and the National Guard are not included, as they're not fully integrated into the U.S. armed forces even if they are federalized for duty within the U.S.
