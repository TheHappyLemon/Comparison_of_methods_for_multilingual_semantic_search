The 2008 World Wrestling Championships were held at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium in Tokyo, Japan. The event took place from October 11 to October 13, 2008. The competition only featured wrestling in the Female Freestyle event. Traditionally, Wrestling World Championships are not held in Olympic years, but in 2008 a female championship was held because the 2008 Summer Olympics included only four of the seven FILA weight classes for females.
