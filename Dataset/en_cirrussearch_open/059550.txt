The Passenger (Italian: Professione: reporter) is a 1975 drama film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni. Written by Antonioni, Mark Peploe, and Peter Wollen, the film is about a disillusioned Anglo-American journalist, David Locke (Jack Nicholson), who assumes the identity of a dead businessman while working on a documentary in Chad, unaware that he is impersonating an arms dealer with connections to the rebels in the current civil war. Along the way, he is accompanied by an unnamed young woman (Maria Schneider). The Passenger was the final film in Antonioni's three-picture deal with producer Carlo Ponti and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, after Blowup (1966) and Zabriskie Point (1970). During the film's release, it was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. The film was originally released by MGM in the United States, but in partial settlement of a dispute over a different project, Nicholson received the film rights and reportedly kept it out of distribution. In 2005, with Nicholson's consent, Sony Pictures Classics remastered the film and re-released it on DVD.
