Rudolphus Antonius "Roy" Makaay (born 9 March 1975) is a Dutch professional football coach and former footballer. As a striker, he was known for his goal-scoring ability as a result of his "aerial prowess and quick drives to the net where he can put the ball away with either foot." He began his career at Vitesse and Tenerife before moving to Deportivo de La Coruña in 1999 and helping the side to their first La Liga title in his first season there. He also won the Copa del Rey in 2002 and the following season was given the European Golden Boot for a 29-goal haul. He remains the club's all-time leading goalscorer. He then moved to Bayern Munich for a then club record €18.75 million, where he picked up the nickname Das Phantom (The Phantom), for his ability to score out of nowhere, as well as Tormaschine (goal machine), for his consistent ability to find the back of the net. After winning two consecutive Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal doubles at Bayern, he returned to the Netherlands with Feyenoord in 2007. A full international from 1996 to 2005, Makaay scored 6 international goals in 43 matches despite competition for a place in the national team. He competed with the Dutch side at two UEFA European Championships and the 2008 Olympics.
