Österland (Eastland) or Österlanden (Easternlands), one of the four traditional lands of Sweden, was a medieval term used for the southern part of Finland. The term occurs in documents approximately between 1350–1470 and gradually fell out of use by the end of the 15th century. Before this period the term was used in plural, Österlanden, Easternlands. With the exception of Old Finland that was ceded to Russia in 1721, Finland remained a part of Sweden until after the Finnish War of 1808–09, when it was ceded to Russia and came to constitute the autonomous Russian Grand Duchy of Finland.
