Originally scheduled to enter production in summer 2009 for a 2011 release, it eventually commenced production in May 2011 and was released on June 15, 2012. The film received mixed critical reviews, but was a box-office bomb, grossing only $59 million worldwide on a $75 million budget. However, Cruise was particularly lauded for his performances of "Pour Some Sugar on Me" and "Wanted Dead or Alive". The related film soundtrack was also well-received, debuting at #1 on the Billboard Top Soundtracks chart.
