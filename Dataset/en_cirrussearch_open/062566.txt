In calculus and related areas of mathematics, a linear function from the real numbers to the real numbers is a function whose graph (in Cartesian coordinates) is a non-vertical line in the plane. The characteristic property of linear functions is that when the input variable is changed, the change in the output is proportional to the change in the input. Linear functions are related to linear equations.
