Léon de Lunden (1856–1947) was a Belgian sports shooter who competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics. He won the first prize in the live pigeon shoot, an event that was unique to the 1900 Games and is no longer recognised by the International Olympic Committee. He totaled 21 kills during the tournament to take gold. He won 5,000 francs for his victory.
