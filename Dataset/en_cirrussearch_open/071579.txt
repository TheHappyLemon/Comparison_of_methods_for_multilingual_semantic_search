Zazie dans le Métro (in French; translated as Zazie in the Metro and sometimes called Zazie) is a 1960 French surrealist slapstick comedy film directed by Louis Malle, based on the 1959 novel Zazie dans le Métro by Raymond Queneau. Frequently surreal, and full of visual and verbal jokes, the intricate plot follows a group of protean characters around a crowded Paris during a Métro strike.
