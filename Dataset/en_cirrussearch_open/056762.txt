Xcas is a user interface to Giac, which is an open source computer algebra system (CAS) for Windows, macOS and Linux among many other platforms. Xcas is written in C++. Giac can be used directly inside software written in C++. Xcas has compatibility modes with many popular algebra systems like WolframAlpha, Mathematica, Maple, or MuPAD. Users can use Giac/Xcas to develop formal algorithms or use it in other software. Giac is used in SageMath for calculus operations. Among other things, Xcas can solve equations (Figure 3) and differential equations (Figure 4) and draw graphs. There is a forum for questions about Xcas. CmathOOoCAS, an OpenOffice.org plugin which allows formal calculation in Calc spreadsheet and Writer word processing, uses Giac to perform calculations.
