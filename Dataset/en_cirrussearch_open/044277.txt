Real Valladolid Club de Fútbol, S.A.D., or simply Real Valladolid (pronounced [reˈal βaʎaðoˈlið]) or Valladolid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Valladolid, Castile and León, Spain that competes in LaLiga Hypermotion, the second tier of the Spanish league system. The club colours are violet and white, used on the kit in stripes from its foundation on 20 June 1928. The team plays its home games at the Estadio José Zorrilla, which seats 27,846 spectators. Valladolid's honours include a single trophy of great relevance, the defunct Copa de la Liga 1983–84. It has been runner-up in the Copa del Rey on two occasions (1949–50 and 1988–89), and has participated in two editions of the UEFA Cup (1984–85 and 1997–98) and also one edition of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (1989–90). The team subsidiary, the Real Valladolid Promesas, currently play in the Segunda Federación. Since its La Liga debut in the 1948–49 season (in which it became the first club from the region to play in La Liga – five others have since done so), Valladolid is the most successful football club in Castile and León by honours and history, with a total of 45 seasons in the First Division, 36 in the Second and 10 in the Third. Historically, Valladolid is the 13th-best team in Spain by overall league points. Two of its players have won the Pichichi Trophy: Manuel Badenes and Jorge da Silva; and ten were internationals with the Spain national football team. In the 21st century, the club's domestic performance follows a yo-yo club pattern, with multiple promotions to (and relegations from) the first division. On 3 September 2018, it was announced that Brazilian former international footballer Ronaldo Nazario had become the majority shareholder after purchasing a 51% controlling stake in the club. As of April 2020[update], Ronaldo is owner of 82% of the club shares.
