Kampot pepper (Khmer: ម្រេចកំពត, mrech Kampot; French: poivre de Kampot) is a cultivar of black pepper (Piper nigrum) grown and produced in Cambodia. During the early 20th century under the French protectorate within French Indochina it was also known as Indochinese pepper (French: poivre d'Indochine; Khmer: ម្រេចឥណ្ឌូចិន, mrech Indauchen). The pepper's modern name is derived from the area where it is grown, the Province of Kampot, but its historic name uses the French term for Mainland Southeast Asia. Kampot pepper is a certified geographical indication (GI) product in Cambodia (since 2010) and in European Union (since 2016). There are two varieties: the small leaf (កំចាយ, kamchay) and the big leaf variety (lampong or belantoeung).
