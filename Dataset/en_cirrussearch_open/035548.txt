The Moomins (Swedish: mumintrollen) are the central characters in a series of novels, short stories, picture books, and a comic strip by Finnish writer and illustrator Tove Jansson, originally published in Swedish by Schildts in Finland. They are a family of white, round fairy-tale characters with large snouts that make them resemble the hippopotamus. However, despite this resemblance, the Moomin family are trolls. The family live in their house in Moominvalley. In all, nine books were released in the series, together with five picture books and a comic strip, between 1945 and 1993. The Moomins have inspired numerous television series, films, and two theme parks: Moomin World in Naantali, Finland, and Akebono Children's Forest Park in Hann≈ç, Saitama, Japan.
