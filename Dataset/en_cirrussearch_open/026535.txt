Annates (/ˈæneɪts/ or /ˈænəts/; Latin: annatae, from annus, "year") were a payment from the recipient of an ecclesiastical benefice to the collating authorities. Eventually, they consisted of half or the whole of the first year's profits of a benefice; after the appropriation of the right of collation by the Roman see, they were paid to the papal treasury, ostensibly as a proffered contribution to the church. They were also known as the "first fruits" (primitiae), a religious offering which dates back to earlier Greek, Roman, and Hebrew religions.
