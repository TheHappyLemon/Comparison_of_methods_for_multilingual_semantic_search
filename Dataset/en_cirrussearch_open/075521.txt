.mf is an assigned Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) that was to be created for the Collectivity of Saint Martin, but it is currently not in use, as it is not available for registration nor website use of the domain. The decision by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency to allocate .mf as the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 domain for Saint Martin on 21 September 2007, followed the decision of Saint Martin's new status as an Overseas collectivity of France, which took effect on 15 July 2007. Currently Saint Martin uses Guadeloupe's ccTLD, .gp and France's ccTLD, .fr.
