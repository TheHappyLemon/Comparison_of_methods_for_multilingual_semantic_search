Jāņi cheese (Latvian: Jāņu siers) is a Latvian sour milk cheese, traditionally eaten on Jāņi, the Latvian celebration of the summer solstice. Nowadays the cheese has become one of the symbols of Latvian culture. In 2021, it was reported that Jāņi cheese was losing its popularity due to the COVID-19 pandemic and consumers opting out for other types of cheeses, such as mozzarella, feta, as well as hard cheese, and aged cheeses.
