The 2021 European Figure Skating Championships were scheduled to be held from 25 to 31 January 2021 at the Arena Zagreb in Zagreb, Croatia. Medals would have been awarded in men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dance. Zagreb was announced as the host in June 2018. The city had previously hosted the competition in 1974, 1979, 2008, and 2013. The competition was cancelled by the International Skating Union on 10 December 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the first time since World War II that the European Championships were not held.
