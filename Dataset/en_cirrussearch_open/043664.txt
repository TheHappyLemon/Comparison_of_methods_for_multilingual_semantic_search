The following is a list of stripped Olympic medals. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is the governing body of the Olympic Games, and as such, can rule athletes to have violated regulations of the Games, for which athletes' Olympic medals can be stripped (i.e., rescinded). Additionally, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has arbitral jurisdiction over all matters related to the Olympic Games and thus also has the power to strip or return medals. Stripped medals must be returned to the IOC by the offending athlete or team, and may only be reinstated by the IOC or CAS. The vast majority of stripped medals are for doping infractions. Doping infractions are often discovered well after the fact, and can result in the stripping of medals many years after their award. On rare occasions, medals are stripped for other reasons.
