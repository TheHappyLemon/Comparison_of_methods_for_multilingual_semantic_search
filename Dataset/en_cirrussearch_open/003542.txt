Forza (/ˈfɔːrtsə/ FORT-sə, Italian: [ˈfɔrtsa]; Italian for "force" and "strength") is a racing video game series for Xbox consoles and Microsoft Windows published by Xbox Game Studios. The franchise is primarily divided into two ongoing titles. The original Forza Motorsport series developed by American developer Turn 10 Studios focuses on primarily simulation racing around a variety of both real and fictional tracks, and seeks to emulate the performance and handling characteristics of many real-life production, modified, and racing cars. The Forza Horizon series developed by British developer Playground Games features more arcade-style racing while maintaining a toned down version of Motorsport's simulation physics. Horizon revolves around a music festival called the "Horizon Festival" and features open world environments set in fictional representations of real-world areas in which players may freely roam and participate in racing events. Apart from Motorsport and Horizon, Forza has also seen two mobile and computer free-to-play spin-offs; Forza Street (2019–2022), a drag racing-style game set in Miami, and Forza Customs (2023), a tile-matching video game based on car customization. Both spin-offs were initially released as independent games before being rebranded as Forza titles. The franchise has sold 16 million copies as of December 2016 and has garnered critical acclaim.
