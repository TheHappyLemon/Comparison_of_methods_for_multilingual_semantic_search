Christian atheism embraces the teachings, narratives, symbols, practices, or communities associated with Christianity without accepting the literal existence of God. Christian atheism takes many forms and may include an ethics system, cultural Christianity, and a variety of Christian theological positions. Prominent Christian atheist thinkers include Thomas J. J. Altizer (who said God died with Jesus), John D. Caputo (who says “God” represents a call to embrace unconditional values such as justice and forgiveness), William Hamilton (who advocated following the teachings of Jesus), Slavoj Žižek (who says "the only way to be an atheist is through Christianity"), and Peter Rollins (who rejects religious systems that purport to resolve doubt and anxiety).
