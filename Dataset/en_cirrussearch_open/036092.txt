Hydrogen cyanide (also known as prussic acid) is a chemical compound with the formula HCN and structural formula H−C≡N. It is a colorless, extremely poisonous, and flammable liquid that boils slightly above room temperature, at 25.6 °C (78.1 °F). HCN is produced on an industrial scale and is a highly valued precursor to many chemical compounds ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals. Large-scale applications are for the production of potassium cyanide and adiponitrile, used in mining and plastics, respectively. It is more toxic than solid cyanide compounds due to its volatile nature. Whether hydrogen cyanide is an organic compound or not is a topic of debate among chemists, and opinions vary from author to author. Traditionally, it is considered inorganic by significant part of authors. Contrary to them, it is considered organic by other authors, because hydrogen cyanide belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nitriles which have the formula R−C≡N, where R is typically organyl group (e.g., alkyl or aryl) or hydrogen. In the case of hydrogen cyanide, the R group is hydrogen H, so the other names of hydrogen cyanide are methanenitrile and formonitrile.
