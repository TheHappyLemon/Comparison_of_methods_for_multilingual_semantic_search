Salacia (minor-planet designation 120347 Salacia) is a large trans-Neptunian object in the Kuiper belt, approximately 850 km (530 mi) in diameter. It was discovered on 22 September 2004, by American astronomers Henry Roe, Michael Brown and Kristina Barkume at the Palomar Observatory in California, United States. Salacia orbits the Sun at an average distance that is slightly greater than that of Pluto. It was named after the Roman goddess Salacia and has a single known moon, Actaea. Brown estimated that Salacia is nearly certainly a dwarf planet. However, William Grundy et al. argue that objects in the size range of 400–1,000 km, with densities of ≈ 1.2 g/cm3 or less and albedos less than ≈ 0.2, have likely never compressed into fully solid bodies or been resurfaced, let alone differentiated or collapsed into hydrostatic equilibrium, and so are highly unlikely to be dwarf planets. Salacia is at the upper end of this size range and has a very low albedo, though Grundy et al. later found it to have the relatively high density of 1.5±0.1 g/cm3.
