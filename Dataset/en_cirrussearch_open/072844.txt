In 2018, she became the first Dane to win a major singles title, at the Australian Open. Known for her footwork and defensive abilities, Wozniacki won 30 WTA Tour singles titles (including six in both 2010 and 2011, the most in a year by a WTA player from 2008–2011) and two doubles titles. A junior major champion, she won the 2006 Wimbledon girls' singles title over Magdaléna Rybáriková and was voted the WTA Newcomer of the Year in 2008. Before her victory at the 2018 Australian Open over Simona Halep, she had reached two major finals at the US Open, falling to Kim Clijsters in 2009 and to Serena Williams in 2014. Wozniacki also won the season-ending WTA Finals in 2017, beating Venus Williams, after previously finishing runner-up to Clijsters at the event in 2010. Other career highlights include winning three Premier Mandatory and three Premier 5 titles, reaching four major semifinals (the 2011 Australian Open and the 2010, 2011 and 2016 US Opens), three major quarterfinals (the 2012 Australian Open and the 2010 and 2017 French Opens), and the quarterfinals at the 2012 London Olympics. Wozniacki retired on 24 January 2020, following a third-round loss at the Australian Open. In 2022, she became a commentator for Tennis Channel and ESPN before she announced in June 2023 a comeback at the Canadian Open and the US Open in August, targeting the 2024 Olympic Games.
