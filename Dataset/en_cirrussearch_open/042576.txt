The Karen Demirchyan Yerevan Subway (Armenian: Կարեն Դեմիրճյանի անվան Երևանի մետրոպոլիտեն, Karen Demirchyani anvan Yerevani metropoliten; since December 1999), colloquially known as the Yerevan Metro (Armenian: Երևանի մետրո), is a rapid transit system that serves the capital of Armenia, Yerevan. Opened on 7 March 1981, it was the eighth metro system in the former Soviet Union. Owned by the government, it is operated by the Karen Demirchyan Yerevan Subway CJSC of the Ministry of Transport and Communication. Unlike most former Soviet rapid transit systems, its stations are not very deep: there are two stations above ground, one sub-surface, and the remaining stations are considered deep-level. However, these stations are quite shallow, averaging a depth of only 16–22 metres (52–72 ft) below the surface. Only three stations are deeper than 30 metres (98 ft): Marshal Baghramyan (approximately 37.5 metres (123 ft)), Barekamutyun (approximately 42 metres (138 ft)) and Yeritasardakan (approximately 37 metres (121 ft)). Stations are intricately decorated with national motifs. The metro runs along 13.4 kilometres (8.3 mi)[citation needed] of track, and currently serves ten active stations.
