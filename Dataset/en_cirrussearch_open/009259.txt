Jari-Matti Latvala (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈjɑriˌmɑtːi ˈlɑt.ʋɑ.lɑ]; born 3 April 1985) is a Finnish rally driver who has competed in the World Rally Championship (WRC). His co-driver for most of his career was Miikka Anttila, who co-drove for Latvala between the 2003 Rallye Deutschland and 2019 Rally Catalunya. He is well known for his aggressive driving style, which earns him many plaudits, and comparisons to the late Colin McRae. With 18 event victories in the WRC, he is one of the most successful drivers to not have won a championship. Latvala is also the driver with the most World Rally starts in the sport which he achieved in 2019, 17 years after his debut. Starting in 2021, he served as the team principal of Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT, replacing Tommi Mäkinen.
