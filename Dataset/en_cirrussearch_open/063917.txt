The Gogol Center, formerly Gogol Theatre, is a multi-use arts complex in Moscow that was home to Russia's leading avant-garde theater. In June 2022 it was closed down by the Russian Government, along with an announcement that it would be renamed Nikolai Gogol Drama Theatre. Starting life as a theatre company called Drama and Comedy Theatre in 1925, the theatre has undergone a succession of renamings, including Moscow Theatre of Transport and Central Theatre of Transport, as the company originally served railway workers. It was first named after writer Nikolai Gogol on the 150th anniversary of his birth, in 1935. The building is located at 8A Kazakova Street, Moscow.
