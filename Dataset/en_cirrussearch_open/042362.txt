Nanterre (/nɒ̃ˈtɛər/, French: [nɑ̃tɛʁ] ) is the prefecture of the Hauts-de-Seine department in the western suburbs of Paris, France. It is located some 11 km (6.8 mi) northwest of the centre of Paris. In 2018, the commune had a population of 96,807. The eastern part of Nanterre, bordering the communes of Courbevoie and Puteaux, contains a small part of the La Défense business district of Paris and some of the tallest buildings in the Paris region. Because the headquarters of many major corporations are located in La Défense, the court of Nanterre is well known in the media for the number of high-profile lawsuits and trials that take place in it. The city of Nanterre also includes the Paris West University Nanterre La Défense, one of the largest universities in the Paris region.
