The Men's World Floorball Championship is an international floorball competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the International Floorball Federation (IFF), the sport's global governing body. It is distinct from the Women's World Floorball Championship, which is for women's teams. They were preceded by the European Championships which were held twice in 1994 and 1995. Originally played in Mayâ€“June, the IFF decided in 2007 to move the tournament to early-December starting in 2008.
