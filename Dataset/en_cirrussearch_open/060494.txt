Rumelia (Ottoman Turkish: روم ايلى, romanized: Rum İli, transl. Land of the Romans; Turkish: Rumeli; Greek: Ρωμυλία) was the name of a historical region in Southeastern Europe that was administered by the Ottoman Empire, roughly corresponding to the Balkans. In its wider sense, it was used to refer to all Ottoman possessions and vassals in Europe. These would later be geopolitically classified as "the Balkans", although the inclusion of countries such as Hungary and Romania has varied over time. During the period of its existence, Rumelia was more often known in English as Turkey in Europe.
