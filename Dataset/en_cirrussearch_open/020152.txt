The points classification (French: classement par points) is a secondary competition in the Tour de France, which started in 1953. Points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints, and these are recorded in a points classification. It is considered a sprinters' competition. The leader is indicated by a green jersey (French: maillot vert), which has become a metonym for the points classification competition. The system has inspired many other cycling races; the other two Grand Tours have also installed points classifications: the Vuelta a Espa√±a since 1955, also using a green jersey, and the Giro d'Italia since 1966.
