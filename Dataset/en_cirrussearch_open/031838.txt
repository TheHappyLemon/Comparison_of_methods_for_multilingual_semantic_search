Sviatoslav III Vsevolodovich of Vladimir (Russian: Святослав III Всеволодович) (27 March 1196 – 3 February 1252) was the Prince of Novgorod (1200–1205, 1207–1210) and Grand Prince of Vladimir-Suzdal (1246–1248).[citation needed] Sviatoslav III Vsevolodovich was the sixth son of Vsevolod the Big Nest and Maria Shvarnovna. Before his death, grand prince Vsevolod divided his territories between his sons; as soon as he died, the Vladimir-Suzdal war of succession (1212–1216) broke out between them. During the partition of his father's lands, he received the town of Yuriev-Polsky. It was he who commissioned the town's principal landmark, the Cathedral of St. George, constructed in 1230–34. In 1220 Sviatoslav sacked Aşlı in Volga Bulgaria.[citation needed] Sviatoslav III's reign in Vladimir was short and uneventful. In 1248, his nephew Mikhail Khorobrit of Moscow, in defiance of the centuries-old succession system, seized the city of Vladimir and ousted Sviatoslav back to Yuriev-Polsky. Two years later, Sviatoslav and his son visited the Golden Horde, pleading with the Khan to reinstate him on the grand princely throne. He died on 3 February 1252 and was buried in Yuriev-Polsky.[citation needed]
