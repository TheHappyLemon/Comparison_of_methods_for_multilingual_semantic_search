The 2020 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 65th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 28th season since it was re-branded from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played on 23 August 2020 at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal, between French club Paris Saint-Germain, in their first European Cup final, and German club Bayern Munich. The match was held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Originally, it had been scheduled to be played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, on 30 May 2020. On 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee chose to relocate the final to Lisbon as part of a "final-eight tournament" consisting of single-match knockout ties played in two stadiums across the city. The match was the first European premier tournament final to be played on a Sunday, and the first since 2009 to not be played on a Saturday. It was also the first final of the competition to be played after June. Bayern Munich won the final 1–0 thanks to a 59th-minute goal scored by former Paris Saint-Germain player Kingsley Coman, who was later selected as man of the match. Bayern secured their sixth European Cup title and second continental treble, becoming the second European men's football team to win the continental treble twice. Bayern also became the first team to claim any European competition with a 100% winning record. As winners, they earned the right to play against the winners of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, Sevilla, in the 2020 UEFA Super Cup, and also qualified for the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar; Bayern went on to win both and complete a historic sextuple (six trophies in a year).
