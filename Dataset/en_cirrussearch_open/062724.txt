The 2022 NHL Entry Draft was the 60th NHL Entry Draft. The draft was held on July 7â€“8, 2022, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec. Montreal were originally scheduled to host the 2020 draft but were unable to do so due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time since 1985, the team hosting the draft selected first overall. The first three selections were Juraj Slafkovsky going to the hosting Montreal Canadiens, Simon Nemec being selected by the New Jersey Devils, and Logan Cooley being picked by the Arizona Coyotes. The selections of Slovak players Slafkovsky and Nemec made this the second time that the top two draftees came from a single European country, after Russians Alexander Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin in 2004.
