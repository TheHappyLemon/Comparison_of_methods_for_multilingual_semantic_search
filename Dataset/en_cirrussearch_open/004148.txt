"Right Now" is an uptempo 1962 jazz/pop song with music by Herbie Mann and lyrics by Carl Sigman. As a jazz instrumental, it was the title track of Right Now, a 1962 bossa nova-style album by Mann. Later that same year, with lyrics by Sigman, the song was popularized by jazz singer Mel Torm√© on his album Comin' Home Baby!, and was the B-side of the single featuring the title track. It was later covered in a variety of pop styles, including recordings by Siouxsie Sioux and her second band the Creatures, who scored a top 15 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1983.
