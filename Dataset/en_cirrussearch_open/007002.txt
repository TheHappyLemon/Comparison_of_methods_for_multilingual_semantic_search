Anamorphosée is the fourth studio album by Mylène Farmer, released on 17 October 1995. Led by the number-one single "XXL", the album was something of a departure from her previous work. Although it received mixed reviews from critics, the album was very successful, peaking at no.1 and staying on the French album chart for almost two years.
