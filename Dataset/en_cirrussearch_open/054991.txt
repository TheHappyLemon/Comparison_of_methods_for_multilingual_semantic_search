Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween (or simply Goosebumps 2 as marketed on home release) is a 2018 American horror comedy film directed by Ari Sandel and written by Rob Lieber from a story by Lieber and Darren Lemke. A stand-alone sequel to 2015's Goosebumps, it is based on the children's horror book series of the same name by R. L. Stine. The new cast consists of Wendi McLendon-Covey, Madison Iseman, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Caleel Harris, Chris Parnell, and Ken Jeong. The plot follows two young boys who accidentally release the monsters from the Goosebumps franchise in their town after opening an unpublished Goosebumps manuscript titled Haunted Halloween, causing a wave of destruction on Halloween night. Development of the film began in September 2015. Rob Letterman intended to return to direct, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with Pok√©mon: Detective Pikachu. Ari Sandel replaced him as director. Jack Black and Odeya Rush were set to reprise their roles as R. L. Stine and Hannah Stine, respectively; Black's role was reduced to an uncredited cameo and Rush's role was ultimately not included in the final script. Goosebumps 2 was released in the United States on October 12, 2018, by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Columbia Pictures label. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and was not as successful as its predecessor, grossing $93 million worldwide against its $35 million budget.
