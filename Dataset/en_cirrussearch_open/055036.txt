Stuart Little 2 is a 2002 American live-action/animated comedy film directed by Rob Minkoff and starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, and Jonathan Lipnicki, and the voices of Michael J. Fox as Stuart Little and Nathan Lane as Snowbell the Cat. Although a sequel to the 1999 film Stuart Little, the plot bears more resemblance to the original novel by E.B. White, in which Stuart and Snowbell meet a canary named Margalo (voiced by Melanie Griffith). Stuart Little 2 premiered in Westwood on July 14, 2002, and was released in theaters for the rest of North America and United Kingdom on July 19 by Columbia Pictures, and grossed $170 million against a $120 million budget, with it also receiving positive critical reviews. It was followed by a third film, a direct-to-video sequel titled Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild in 2005.
