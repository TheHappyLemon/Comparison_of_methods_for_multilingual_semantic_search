ICA Gruppen AB (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈîːka]; "ICA Group"; from Inköpscentralernas aktiebolag, lit. 'the Purchasing Centres' Corporation') is a Swedish retailer franchise with a focus on food and health. The group also owns a bank, real estate division and a pharmacy chain. The company was started in 1938, based on a business model which was introduced by Hakonbolagen in 1917. Most of its operations are based in Scandinavia, and the company is the second largest retail company in the Nordic countries[citation needed]. The company was owned by the participating retailers until 2000 when half of the company was sold to the Dutch retailer Ahold. It acquired a further 10% in 2004. Ahold is prevented by contractual obligation from exercising majority control over ICA. In 2013 Ahold sold its shares to Hakon for $3.1bn. In 2019, Hemtex was sold to Norwegian home textile chain Kid ASA.
