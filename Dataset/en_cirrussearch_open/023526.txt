Toretsk (Ukrainian: Торе́цьк, IPA: [toˈrɛt͡sʲk]; Russian: Торецк) is an industrial city in Bakhmut Raion, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. It is the administrative center of Toretsk urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. As of January 2022, its population was approximately 30,914. It has its origins as the hamlet Shcherbynivka (Ukrainian: Щербинівка; Russian: Щербиновка, romanized: Shcherbinovka), built during the mid-19th century developments in coal mining in the Donbas. It developed over the following century with the rise of rail transport, and was renamed to Dzerzhynsk (Ukrainian: Дзержинськ; Russian: Дзержинск, romanized: Dzerzhinsk) when it was part of the Soviet Union. It received its current name in 2016, during decommunization in Ukraine. Toretsk has seen fighting and shelling during the protracted Russo-Ukrainian War that began in 2014, which has depopulated and heavily damaged the infrastructure of the city over the years.
