Vanessa Hinz (born 24 March 1992) is a former German biathlete and cross-country skier. Hinz started in her first world cup races at the end of the 2012/13-season. At the 2013 European Championships she won a gold medal with the German relay team. In 2014, she participated in the Winter Olympics in Sochi. She was officially nominated by the DOSB on 23 January 2014, but not taken with the team to Russia. So she had to wait at home as stand-by reserve.
