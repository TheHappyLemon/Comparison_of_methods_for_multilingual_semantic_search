The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union) competed at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It would be the last Winter Olympic Games before the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. Six of the former Soviet republics would compete together as the Unified Team at the 1992 Winter Olympics, and each republic would be independently represented at subsequent Games. The Soviet Union had its best showing at the Winter Olympics in terms of total medals (overtaking its 1976 result with 27 medals) and second-best in terms of gold medals (after the aforementioned 1976 result with 13 gold medals).
