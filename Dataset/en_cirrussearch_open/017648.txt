Samanta Poļakova (Latvian pronunciation: [ˈsamanta ˈpuɔlʲakova]; born 31 March 1989), better known as Samanta Tīna, is a Latvian singer, songwriter and composer. After having attempted to represent her country in the Eurovision Song Contest seven times earlier (in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019), she won the national selection Supernova in 2020 and was to represent Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 that was to be held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands with the song "Still Breathing". Due to the contest being canceled, she was internally selected to represent her country in 2021 instead with a new song, "The Moon Is Rising". She had also competed in the Lithuanian preselection twice (in 2013 and 2017), and in the Lithuanian version of The Voice.
