The 2017–18 Serie A (known as the Serie A TIM for sponsorship reasons) was the 116th season of top-tier Italian football, the 86th in a round-robin tournament and the 8th since its organization under a league committee separate from Serie B. Juventus were the six-time defending champions. The season ran from 19 August 2017 to 20 May 2018. On 13 May, Juventus won a record seventh consecutive title and 34th title overall with one game remaining following their 0–0 draw with Roma. The season was marred by the death of Davide Astori, the captain of Fiorentina, due to heart problems.
