Shock Value II is the third studio album by American record producer Timbaland. It serves as the sequel to his previous album, Shock Value. Initially slated for a 2008 release, the project was pushed into 2009 and tentatively confirmed for November 23, 2009 through Blackground Records, however, it was pushed back once more and finally released on December 7, 2009 in the UK and December 8 in the US. The album was supported by the successful singles "Carry Out" (featuring Justin Timberlake) and "Say Something" (featuring Drake). Unlike its predecessor, it expands beyond hip hop and R&B to include collaborations with alternative rock acts Chad Kroeger, Jet, the Fray and Daughtry, as well as pop artists Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, JoJo, Melody Thornton, and Esthero. Upon release, Shock Value II performed moderately on the Billboard 200 and was met with unfavorable critical reception.
