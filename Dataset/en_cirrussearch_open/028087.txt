"You Owe Me One" (working title: "Kamelo") is a song recorded by Swedish pop group ABBA in 1982 for their unfinished ninth album. It was released as a B-side for the group's last single — "Under Attack" and on the 1997 and 2012 remasters of "The Visitors". It was excluded from the 2001 remaster due to the group's songwriters critical attitude towards "You Owe Me One". The vocal is shared by Anni-Frid Lyngstad, and Agnetha Fältskog singing in unison. For nearly four decades, "You Owe Me One" had stood as the last new song to be released by ABBA as an active group, until the 2021 release of "I Still Have Faith in You" and "Don't Shut Me Down" as a dual single from the band's ninth studio album and first in 40 years, Voyage.
