The 2004 NHL Entry Draft was the 42nd NHL Entry Draft. It was held on June 26 and 27, 2004 at the RBC Center in Raleigh, North Carolina. It is especially notable because it was the last NHL event to take place before the beginning of the lockout, which canceled all the games scheduled for the 2004â€“05 NHL season. As of 2023, the remaining active players in the NHL from this draft are Alexander Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin, Blake Wheeler, Alex Goligoski and Alexander Edler.
