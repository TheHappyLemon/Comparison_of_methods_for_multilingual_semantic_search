Vichy (/ˈvɪʃi, ˈviːʃi/, French: [viʃi] ; Occitan: Vichèi [viˈtʃɛj]) is a city in the Allier department, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, central France, in the historic province of Bourbonnais. It is a spa and resort town and in World War II was the capital of Vichy France from 1940 to 1944. The term Vichyste indicated collaboration with the Nazi regime, often carrying a pejorative connotation. In 2021, the town became part of the transnational UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name "Great Spa Towns of Europe" because of its famous baths and its architectural testimony to the popularity of spa towns in Europe from the 18th through 20th centuries.
