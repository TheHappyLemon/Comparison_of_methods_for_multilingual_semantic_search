The Morocco national football team (Arabic: منتخب الْمَغْرِب لِكُرَّةُ الْقَدَم) represents Morocco in men's international football, and is controlled by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, the governing body for football in Morocco. One of Africa's most successful national football teams, Morocco won the 1976 African Cup of Nations, two African Nations Championships and a FIFA Arab Cup while participating in the FIFA World Cup six times. They made history in 1986, when they became the first African team to finish top of a group at a World Cup and the first African team to reach the knockout stages. However, they lost to West Germany 1–0. Morocco defied all expectations at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, topping their group containing Croatia, Canada and Belgium. Morocco also eliminated Spain and Portugal to become the first African team to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup. They were also the third ever semi-finalist not from Europe or South America. Morocco were knocked out by France in the semi-finals and lost the third place play-off by Croatia, therefore finishing in 4th-place, their highest ever finish. Morocco is set to become the second African nation, the second MENA nation and the first North African nation to host the World Cup when it was granted host status for the 2030 edition alongside the two European countries Portugal and Spain. The Atlas Lions were ranked 10th in the FIFA World Rankings in April 1998. They were ranked as the top African national team for three consecutive years, from 1997 to 1999, and again since December 2022. As of February 2024, Morocco is ranked as the 12th best national team in the world.
