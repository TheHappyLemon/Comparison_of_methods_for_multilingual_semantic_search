The Grudge is a 2020 American supernatural horror film written and directed by Nicolas Pesce. The film takes place before and during the events of the 2004 film of the same name (and its two sequels), which was a remake of the 2002 Japanese film Ju-On: The Grudge. It is the fourth installment in the American The Grudge film series and stars Andrea Riseborough, Demián Bichir, John Cho, Betty Gilpin, Lin Shaye, and Jacki Weaver. The film follows a police officer who investigates several murders that are seemingly connected to a single house. A sequel to The Grudge films was announced in 2011. In March 2014, it was officially announced that a reboot was in the works, with Jeff Buhler set to write the script. In July 2017, filmmaker Nicolas Pesce was hired for rewrites, based on Buhler's script, and to direct the film. On a budget of $12–14 million, filming took place from May to June 2018. The Grudge was released by Sony Pictures Releasing in Indonesia on December 31, 2019, followed by other international territories in the subsequent days, and in the United States on January 3, 2020. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed over $49 million worldwide.
