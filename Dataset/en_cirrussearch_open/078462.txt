The Azerbaijani alphabet (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan əlifbası, آذربایجان اَلیفباسؽ, Азəрбајҹан әлифбасы) has three versions which includes the Arabic, Latin, and Cyrillic alphabets. North Azerbaijani, the official language of Republic of Azerbaijan, is written in a modified Latin alphabet. This superseded previous versions based on Cyrillic and Arabic scripts after the fall of Soviet Union. In Iran, where Iranian Azerbaijanis make up the second largest ethnic group after ethnic Persians, a modified Persian script is widely used to write the South Azerbaijani language. Azerbaijanis of Dagestan and other parts of Russia still use the Cyrillic script.[better source needed]
