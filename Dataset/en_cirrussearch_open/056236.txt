Battle of Hummelshof took place on July 19, 1702 (O.S.) near the small town Hummelshof in Swedish Livonia (present-day Estonia). It was the second significant Russian victory in the Great Northern War in which a Russian army under Boris Sheremetev attacked a much smaller force under Wolmar Anton von Schlippenbach and defeated it after experiencing similar casualties to the Swedes. This was a final blow to the Swedish force defending Livonia and the defeat left it fully open to Russian attacks.
