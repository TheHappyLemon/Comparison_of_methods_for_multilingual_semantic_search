The flag of Equatorial Guinea (Spanish: Bandera de Guinea Ecuatorial; French: Drapeau de la Guinée équatoriale; Portuguese: Bandeira da Guiné Equatorial) was adopted on August 21, 1979. The six stars on the flag represent Equatorial Guinea's mainland and five islands. Under the rule of dictator Francisco Nguema the flag was modified and a different national emblem was used in it. After he was deposed the original flag was restored.
