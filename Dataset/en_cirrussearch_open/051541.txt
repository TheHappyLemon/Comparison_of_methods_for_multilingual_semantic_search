La Belle Ã‰poque is a 2019 French romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Nicolas Bedos. The film stars Daniel Auteuil as Victor, a man in his 60s whose long marriage to Marianne (Fanny Ardant) is on the rocks. When Victor meets Antoine (Guillaume Canet), the owner of a company which allows people to perform a version of "time travel" by visiting a stage where the company acts out a staged historical reenactment, he takes the opportunity to revisit the moment when he first met Marianne, in hopes of rekindling his love for her. The film premiered out of competition at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.
