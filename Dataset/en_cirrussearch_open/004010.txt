The Szczecin tram system is a 12-line, standard gauge tramway system in Szczecin, Poland, that has been in operation since 1879 (when the town was Stettin, Prussia). The tramway operates on 65 kilometers (40 mi) of route. There are two depots and twelve balloon loops (including five street ones). Daytime lines (night lines were abolished in 1996) are operated by the company Tramwaje Szczecińskie (Szczecin Tramways), on behalf of the ZDiTM (Zarząd Dróg i Transportu Miejskiego [pl]; Road and Public Transport Administration). There is also a tourist line operated by the Szczecin's Association of the Enthusiasts of Public Transport.
