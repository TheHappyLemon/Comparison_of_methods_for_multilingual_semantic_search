The 8th Chess Olympiad (Spanish: La 8a Olimpíada de ajedrez), organised by the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE), comprised an open tournament, as well as a Women's World Championship contest. The main team event took place between August 21 and September 19, 1939, in the Politeama Theatre [es] in Buenos Aires, Argentina and coincided with the outbreak of World War II. Following the end of the 8th Olympiad, the Chess Olympiad was suspended indefinitely due to economic concerns in conjunction with World War II; the next Chess Olympiad would not be held until 1950.
