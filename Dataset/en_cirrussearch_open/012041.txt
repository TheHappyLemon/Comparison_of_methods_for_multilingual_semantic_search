Jūrmala Airport (ICAO: EVJA) is an airport located 5 km (3 mi) in Smārde Parish, Tukums Municipality, in the Courland region of Latvia, southeast of Tukums. All of the airport's technical infrastructure, runway and buildings are what was left of the former Soviet military Tukums air base, which was a spartan military airfield with a single long ramp and revetted area. The base was completely abandoned, but in 2010 the conversion of the base to a civil airport with passenger terminals started.
