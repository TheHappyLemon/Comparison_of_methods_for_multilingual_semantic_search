Ciro Immobile Cavaliere OMRI (born 20 February 1990) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a striker for and captains both Serie A club Lazio and the Italy national team. Immobile began his career at Sorrento. In 2009, he was purchased by Juventus, and was later loaned out to three Serie B clubs, including Pescara, with whom he won the league title as the top scorer, before moving to Genoa in 2012. After a season with the club, he moved to Juventus' rivals Torino, where he won the Capocannoniere award for the top scorer in Serie A. After his breakout season at Torino, he was sold to German club Borussia Dortmund for around €18 million in 2014, where they won the DFL-Supercup, before moving to Spanish club Sevilla in 2015. In 2016, he returned to Torino on loan, and was later sold to Lazio in July of that year. At Lazio, Immobile has won a Coppa Italia and two Supercoppa Italiana titles, and is currently the club's all-time highest goalscorer. In his second season at Lazio, he won the Capocannoniere for a second time, with 29 goals in 33 games. The 2019–20 season was the most prolific of Immobile's career; he equalled the record for most Serie A goals in a season with 36, and won a third Capocannoniere title and first European Golden Shoe, given to the top scorer in Europe. In 2022, he won the Capocannoniere for a fourth time, with 27 goals in 31 games. He currently sits eighth in the all-time list of Serie A top scorers. Immobile made his debut for the Italy senior team in 2014, and was included in the squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and two UEFA European Championships (2016 and 2020), winning the latter tournament.
