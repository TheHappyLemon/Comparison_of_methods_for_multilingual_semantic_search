Kalsoy (Faroese pronunciation: [ˈkalsɔɪ], Danish: Kalsø) is an island in the north-east of the Faroe Islands of Denmark between Eysturoy and Kunoy. The name means man island; by contrast with the parallel island to the east, Kunoy, the name of which means woman island. The northernmost part and scenery of Kalsoy was used as stand-in for the Kuril Islands in eastern Russia while filming for the 25th James Bond movie No Time to Die. In the film, which was released in 2021, the villain's lair is located on the island, for which a harbour and missile silos were added digitally. Kalsoy, like Svínoy, is a comparatively isolated island, in that no bridge, tunnel, or causeway links to it.
