The 2011 UCI Road World Championships took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, over 19â€“25 September 2011. The event consisted of a cycling road race and a time trial for men, women, men under 23, and for the first time since 2004 the junior men and junior women competed at the same event as the elite riders. It was the 78th running of the Road World Championships. Castelfidardo near Loreto in Italy was also a candidate, but Italy held the UCI Road World Championships in Varese in 2008. It was the first time that Denmark has hosted the event since 1956, when it was also held in Copenhagen.
