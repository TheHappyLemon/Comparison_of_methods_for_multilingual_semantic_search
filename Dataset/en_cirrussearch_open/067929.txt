On 3 July 2023, the Israeli military conducted a major assault on the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. The Israeli government stated that the goal of the operation, named "Operation Home and Garden", was to target militants within the camp. The attack began in the early hours of 3 July and resulted in the deaths of at least 12 Palestinians, including at least 9 militants, and injuries to 100 others. The military emphasized that the operation is "one in a series", limited to the refugee camp area in Jenin. Up to 500 Palestinian families had to leave their homes due to the Israeli assault. The assault was the largest incursion and deployment of aerial force against militants in the West Bank in 20 years, since fighting during the Second Intifada. Israeli military and political echelons expressed differing views about the scale and intent of the operation.
