The Olza /ˈɔːlzə/ (Czech: Olše, German: Olsa) is a river in Poland and the Czech Republic, a right (eastern) tributary of the River Oder. It flows from the Silesian Beskids mountains through southern Cieszyn Silesia in Poland and the Frýdek-Místek and Karviná districts of the Czech Republic, often forming the border with Poland. It flows into the Oder River north of Bohumín. The Olza-Oder confluence also forms a part of the border. The river is a symbol of the Trans-Olza region, which lies on its west bank, constituting a part of the western half of Cieszyn Silesia, as depicted in the words of the unofficial anthem of this region and of local Poles, Płyniesz Olzo po dolinie (Thou flowest, Olza, down the valley), written by Jan Kubisz. The Olza has also inspired many other artists. Among those who have written about the river are Adolf Fierla, Pola Gojawiczyńska, Emanuel Grim, Julian Przyboś, Vladislav Vančura, and Adam Wawrosz. The singer Jaromír Nohavica has used the Olza as a motif in several of his songs.
