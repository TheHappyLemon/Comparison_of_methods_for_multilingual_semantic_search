Gatun Lake (Spanish: Lago Gatún) is a freshwater artificial lake to the south of Colón, Panama. At approximately 26 m (85 ft) above sea level, it forms a major part of the Panama Canal, carrying ships 33 km (21 mi) of their transit across the Isthmus of Panama. It was created June 27, 1913 when the gates of the spillway at Gatun Dam were closed. The water level was about 14.6 m (48 ft) above sea level and was expected to fill to operating levels in the next six months.
