The Estádio D. Afonso Henriques (English: D. Afonso Henriques Stadium) is a football stadium in the city of Guimarães, Portugal. The stadium is home of Guimarães's most successful team, Vitória de Guimarães, presently competing in the top-flight Portuguese Liga. The stadium was built in 1965 and was renovated and expanded in 2003 for the UEFA Euro 2004 tournament by architect Eduardo Guimarães for €37.3 million. Estádio D. Afonso Henriques has a capacity of 30,029 and it is named after the first King of Portugal—and also a Guimarães native—Dom Afonso Henriques. It was formerly known as Estádio Municipal de Guimarães, and before that as the Estádio D. Afonso Henriques (1965).
