The Vezina Trophy (/vɛzənə/ VEH-zə-nə) is awarded annually to the National Hockey League's (NHL) goaltender who is "adjudged to be the best at this position". At the end of each season, the thirty-two NHL general managers vote to determine the winner. It is named in honour of Georges Vezina, goaltender of the Montreal Canadiens from 1910 until 1925, who died in 1926 of tuberculosis. The trophy was first awarded after the 1926–27 NHL season and was awarded to the top goaltender. From 1946–47 to 1981–82, the trophy went to the goaltender(s) of the team allowing the fewest goals during the regular season; since the 1981–82 season, the William M. Jennings Trophy has been awarded for this accomplishment. The most recent winner is Linus Ullmark of the Boston Bruins in the 2022–23 season.
