The Estación Científica Antártica Ruperto Elichiribehety (English: Ruperto Elichiribehety Antarctic Scientific Station; better known in English by its Spanish acronym ECARE) is an Uruguay summer research station in Antarctica, established by the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute on December 22, 1997 on the Antarctic Peninsula. ECARE is located in Hut Cove, southeast of Hope Bay in the northeastern part of the Antarctic Peninsula, next to the Argentinian Esperanza Base. The Station can accommodate eight people, and it is dedicated to support scientific projects in the surrounding area. It was formerly the British Station D, known as Trinity House. The station is named in honour of Ruperto Elichiribehety, a Uruguayan Navy Lieutenant who, in 1916, led the Uruguayan Expedition attempting to rescue the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition[citation needed] that was lost on Elephant Island.
