The chestnut clearwing moth (Coptotriche perplexa) was a species of moth in the family Tischeriidae. It was endemic to the United States. It is characterized by clear wings and a dark and metallic blue abdomen seemingly wrapped in a yellow band of color. By 1996 it had become extinct due to chestnut blight obliterating its primary food source, the American chestnut.
