Population: 10,541 (2022 estimate). First, a new railway station was built near the village of Horodyshche, which was named Hrebinka in honor of the Ukrainian writer Yevhen Hrebinka, who was born nearby, in the village of Maryanivka. Until 18 July 2020, Hrebinka was the administrative center of Hrebinka Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Poltava Oblast to four. The area of Hrebinka Raion was merged into Lubny Raion.
