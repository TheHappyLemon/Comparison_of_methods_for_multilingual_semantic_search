The 103rd edition of the Tour of Flanders (Dutch: Ronde van Vlaanderen) was held on 7 April 2019 in Belgium. It was the 14th event of the 2019 UCI World Tour and the second monument classic of the season, following Milan–San Remo. The race was won by Italian rider Alberto Bettiol (EF Education First Pro Cycling). The race started in Antwerp and finished in Oudenaarde, covering 267 kilometres (166 mi). It featured 17 categorized climbs and five flat sectors of cobbled roads. Dutch rider Niki Terpstra won the previous edition in 2018. Terpstra crashed out this year in a multiple bike pile-up early in the race. He appeared to be unconscious for more than a minute, was ultimately taken to hospital and forced to abandon the race.
