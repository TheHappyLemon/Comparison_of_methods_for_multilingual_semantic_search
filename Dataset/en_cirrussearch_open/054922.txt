Hülkenberg graduated to Formula One in 2010 with the Williams team. Despite claiming the first pole position for Williams in more than five years, he was not retained for 2011 and joined Force India as a test and reserve driver, being promoted to a race seat with the team for the 2012 season. In 2013 he drove for the Sauber team, but returned to Force India for the 2014 season. In October 2016, it was confirmed that he would switch to Renault for 2017. He was replaced by Esteban Ocon for the 2020 Formula One season and left without a seat, in turn joining Racing Point as a reserve driver. In 2020, he drove for Racing Point in three races, following positive COVID tests for both Lance Stroll and Sergio Perez. He then would drive again in place of Sebastian Vettel at Aston Martin at the first two races of the 2022 season, following Vettel's positive COVID test. He returned as a full-time driver for the 2023 season, driving for Haas F1 Team. As of 2024[update], Hülkenberg holds the record for the most Formula One career starts without a podium finish (206), a record he claimed when he failed to finish in his 129th race (the 2017 Singapore Grand Prix) and in so doing passed Adrian Sutil's previous record of 128.
