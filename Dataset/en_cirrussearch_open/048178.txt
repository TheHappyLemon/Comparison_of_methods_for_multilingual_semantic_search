Purgaz or Inäzor Purgaz (Erzya: Пургаз (Инязор Пургаз), Russian: Пургас, Purgas) was an Erzän leader in the first half of the 13th century. He was a Grand Duke (inäzor) of the Erzän Principality of Purgaz. Being an ally of Volga Bulgaria, he resisted easterly Slavic expansion of Suzdalian Rus forces into the region. In later times, he became a symbol of Erzän independence and a figure of legend.
