The Patrice Lumumba Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (Russian: Российский университет дружбы народов имени Патриса Лумумбы), also known as RUDN University and until 1992 and after March 2023, as Patrice Lumumba University in honour of the Congolese politician Patrice Lumumba, is a public research university located in Moscow, Russia. It was established in 1960 by a resolution from the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR to help nations to assist countries that had recently achieved independence from colonial powers. The university also acted to further Soviet foreign policy goals in nonaligned countries. The University focused on catering to non-aligned countries, which were previously known as the "Third World". The University's main goal was to train personnel from Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. RUDN University was considered the 'Oxford' of Russia in the mid-1980s due to the fame it achieved within a short period. RUDN University's stance on global issues became neutral after the end of the Cold War with the collapse of the Soviet Union.[citation needed] RUDN University mainly focuses on research and has partnerships with over 2500 foreign universities and research centres. In March 2023, the name of Patrice Lumumba was returned to the RUDN University.
