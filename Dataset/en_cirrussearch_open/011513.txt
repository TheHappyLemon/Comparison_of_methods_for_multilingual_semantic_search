Vasco Rossi (born 7 February 1952), also known mononymously as Vasco or with the nickname Il Blasco, is an Italian singer-songwriter and poet. He has published 30 albums (not including unofficial releases) and written over 250 songs, as well as lyrics for other artists. Rossi calls himself a provocautore (an Italian portmanteau for "provoking author") as throughout his career he has been regularly criticized over his choice of lifestyle and the lyrics in his songs. With more than 35 million copies sold, he is one of the best-selling Italian singers. His Modena Park 2017 concert is the first highest-attended ticketed concert of all time.
