This is a list of princes of Galicia (Halych or Halychyna) and its sister principality Volhynia (or Volodymyr). They were basically separate principalities (rulers being closely related) until Roman the Great, Prince of Volhynia who conquered also Halych but immediately gave it to his son. They continued usually as separate states, but within the same dynasty and under vassalage to Knyaz of Halych until Lev, who annexed Volhynia to the principality. The royal crown lapsed and rulers were known as princes and/or dukes after Andriy Yuriyovych. Roman Mstislavich united Halych and Volhynia in 1199.
