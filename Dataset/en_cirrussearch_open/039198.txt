Schleswig (UK: /ˈʃlɛsvɪɡ/, US: /-wɪɡ, -wɪk, -vɪk, ˈʃleɪsvɪk/, German: [ˈʃleːsvɪç] ; Danish: Slesvig; South Jutlandic: Sljasvig; Low German: Sleswig) is a town in the northeastern part of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is the capital of the Kreis (district) Schleswig-Flensburg. It has a population of about 27,000, the main industries being leather and food processing. It takes its name from the Schlei, an inlet of the Baltic sea at the end of which it sits, and vik or vig which means "bay" in Old Norse and Danish. Schleswig or Slesvig therefore means "bay of the Schlei".
