Gunungsitoli is a city located in North Sumatra province, Indonesia, on the Indian Ocean island of Nias, west of Sumatra. Gunungsitoli is the island's only city and is the main hub for the island and surrounding smaller islands. Located on the north-eastern side of Nias island, the city was historically a series of fortifications made by the Dutch colonial administration in the 1600s to defend against frequent raids from Nias tribes, especially those from southern parts of the island. Until 1914, it was the only part of the island that was effectively controlled by the Dutch. Gunungsitoli had a population of 126,202 at the 2010 Census and 136,017 at the 2020 Census; in mid 2023, Gunungsitoli had a population of 142,890 (comprising 69,735 males and 73,155 females), which makes it the seventh-most-populous city in North Sumatra. It had a population density of 304 people per square kilometre, making it the most-densely populated place on Nias island. Being the only city in the island, Gunungsitoli is the economic hub of the island and the surrounding Nias archipelago, as well as the only place with significant, non-agriculture industries, on the island. The city was previously part of the larger Nias Regency but was separated on 29 October 2008.
