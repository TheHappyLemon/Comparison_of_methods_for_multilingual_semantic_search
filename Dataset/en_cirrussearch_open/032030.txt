The Union Europ√©enne de Cyclisme (abbreviation: UEC, English: European Cycling Union) is the European confederation of national cycling bodies; the national federations of the Union Cycliste Internationale form confederations by continent. It is headquartered in Lausanne. In reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the UEC announced that Russia and Belarus officials will not be able to officiate at any UEC event, or attend or take part in any UEC meeting, committee, or forum.
