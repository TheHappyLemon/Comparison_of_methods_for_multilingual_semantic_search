Legionella pneumophila is an aerobic, pleomorphic, flagellated, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative bacterium of the genus Legionella. L. pneumophila is the primary human pathogenic bacterium in this group. In nature, L. pneumophila infects freshwater and soil amoebae of the genera Acanthamoeba and Naegleria. This pathogen is found commonly near freshwater environments and will then invade the amoebae found in these environments, using them to carry out metabolic functions. L. pneumophila is also the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, also known as legionellosis. Due to L. pneumophilaâ€™s ability to thrive in water, it can grow in water filtration systems, leading to faucets, showers, and other fixtures and then spread through aerosolized water droplets. Once infected, this bacterium can cause pneumonia with symptoms such as fever, delirium, diarrhea, and decreased liver and kidney function. After its initial discovery, it was found that Legionella replicates inside amoeba, which suggests that bacteria replicating in environmental protozoa have the ability to exploit signaling pathways in human phagocytic cells.
