The 1977 NHL Amateur Draft was the 15th NHL Entry Draft. It was held at the Mount Royal Hotel in Montreal, Quebec. It was notable for the inclusion of players being drafted at 20 years of age. This was the only draft in which the Cleveland Barons as a distinctive franchise drafted, as they would fold prior to the 1978 draft. The last active player in the NHL from this draft class was Gordie Roberts, who played his last NHL game in the 1993â€“94 season.
