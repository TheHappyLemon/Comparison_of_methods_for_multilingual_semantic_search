The newton (symbol: N) is the unit of force in the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as 1 kg⋅m/s2{\displaystyle 1\ {\text{kg}}\cdot {\text{m/s}}^{2}}, the force which gives a mass of 1 kilogram an acceleration of 1 metre per second squared. It is named after Isaac Newton in recognition of his work on classical mechanics, specifically his second law of motion.
