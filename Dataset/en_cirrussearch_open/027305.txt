Monza (US: /ˈmɒnzə, ˈmoʊnzə, ˈmoʊntsɑː/, Italian: [ˈmontsa] ; Lombard: Monça, locally Monscia [ˈmũːʃa]; Latin: Modoetia) is a city and comune (municipality) on the River Lambro, a tributary of the River Po, in the Lombardy region of Italy, about 15 kilometres (9 miles) north-northeast of Milan. It is the capital of the province of Monza and Brianza. Monza is best known for its Grand Prix motor racing circuit, the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, which hosts the Formula One Italian Grand Prix. On 11 June 2004, Monza was designated the capital of the new province of Monza and Brianza. The new administrative arrangement came fully into effect in summer 2009; previously, Monza was a comune within the province of Milan. Monza is the third-largest city of Lombardy and is the most important economic, industrial and administrative centre of the Brianza area, supporting a textile industry and a publishing trade. Monza also hosts a department of the University of Milano-Bicocca, a Court of Justice and several offices of regional administration. Monza Park is one of the largest urban parks in Europe.
