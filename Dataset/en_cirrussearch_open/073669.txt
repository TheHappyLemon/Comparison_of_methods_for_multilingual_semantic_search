Smirnov (masculine, Russian: Смирнов) or Smirnova (feminine, Russian: Смирнова) is one of the two most common surnames in Russia. Smirnov (Russian: Смирнов) is derived from an adjectival nickname smirnyj (Russian: смирный; in archaic form smirnoy, Russian: смирной), that means "quiet, still, peaceful, gentle".
