Gobioninae is a monophyletic subfamily of Eurasian cyprinid fishes. A species-rich subfamily, it is divided into five tribes: Gobionini, Pseudogobionini, Hemibarbini, Coreiini, and Sarcocheilichthyini. To adapt to different masticatory operations, members of the Gobioninae developed various types of pharyngeal bones and teeth; some have intermediate pharyngeal bones with rows of diverse teeth (conical, compressed, and coarsely compressed), others have broad pharyngeal bones with a single row of molar teeth. Some Gobioninae have narrow pharyngeal bones with a row of extremely compressed teeth.
