Targets is a 1968 American crime thriller film directed by Peter Bogdanovich in his theatrical directorial debut, and starring Tim O'Kelly, Boris Karloff, Nancy Hsueh, Bogdanovich, James Brown, Arthur Peterson and Sandy Baron. The film depicts two parallel narratives which converge during the climax: one follows Bobby Thompson, a seemingly ordinary and wholesome young man who embarks on an unprovoked killing spree; the other depicts Byron Orlok, an iconic horror film actor who is disillusioned by real-life violence and is contemplating retirement. Produced by Roger Corman and written by Polly Platt and Bogdanovich, the film was loosely inspired by Charles Whitman, a mass shooter who committed the Tower shooting at the University of Texas in 1966. The film was shot in late 1967 in the Los Angeles area. Because of its release by Paramount Pictures shortly after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, the studio's executives chose to market the film as a commentary on gun violence in the United States, fearing its content would alienate audiences otherwise, but it was ultimately a box-office bomb. Despite its commercial failure, the film was well-received by critics, and was included in the 2003 book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.
