The Staunton Gambit is a chess opening characterised by the moves: 1. d4 f5 (the Dutch Defence) 2. e4!? White sacrifices a pawn for quick development, with the idea of launching an attack against Black's kingside, which has been somewhat weakened by 1...f5. Black can decline the gambit with 2...d6, transposing to the Balogh Defence, but accepting the pawn with 2...fxe4 is considered stronger. Although the Staunton Gambit was once a feared weapon for White, it is rarely played today, since theory has shown how to neutralise it, and White scores only about 50 percent. The ECO codes for Staunton Gambit are A82 and A83. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
