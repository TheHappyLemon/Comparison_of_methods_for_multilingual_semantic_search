In trigonometry, the law of cosines (also known as the cosine formula or cosine rule) relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. For a triangle with sides a,{\displaystyle a,} b,{\displaystyle b,} and c,{\displaystyle c,} opposite respective angles α,{\displaystyle \alpha ,} β,{\displaystyle \beta ,} and γ{\displaystyle \gamma } (see Fig. 1), the law of cosines states: c2=a2+b2−2abcos⁡γ,a2=b2+c2−2bccos⁡α,b2=a2+c2−2accos⁡β.{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}c^{2}&=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos \gamma ,\\[3mu]a^{2}&=b^{2}+c^{2}-2bc\cos \alpha ,\\[3mu]b^{2}&=a^{2}+c^{2}-2ac\cos \beta .\end{aligned}}} The law of cosines generalizes the Pythagorean theorem, which holds only for right triangles: if γ{\displaystyle \gamma } is a right angle then cos⁡γ=0,{\displaystyle \cos \gamma =0,} and the law of cosines reduces to c2=a2+b2.{\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.} The law of cosines is useful for solving a triangle when all three sides or two sides and their included angle are given.
