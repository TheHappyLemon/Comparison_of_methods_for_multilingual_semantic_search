Richard Joseph Rypien (May 16, 1984 – August 15, 2011) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who spent parts of six seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Vancouver Canucks from 2005 to 2011. After a major junior career of four years with the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League (WHL), he was signed to a professional contract by the minor league Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League (AHL) in 2005. The following season, he signed with the Canucks. He spent six years with the organization, splitting time between the Canucks and Moose, their AHL affiliate. A fourth-line player in the NHL, he was known for his hitting and fighting abilities, though his size was not typical of an enforcer. Following the 2010–11 NHL season, Rypien signed with the Winnipeg Jets, but died before joining his new team. His death was ruled a suicide and had been preceded by a history of clinical depression, for which he had had two personal leaves of absence from the Canucks. In the wake of Rypien's death, the Canucks and the Jets started an initiative to help others with mental illness.
