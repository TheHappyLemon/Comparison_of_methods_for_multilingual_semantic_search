Wikiquote is part of a family of wiki-based projects run by the Wikimedia Foundation using MediaWiki software. The project's objective is to produce collaboratively a vast reference of quotations from prominent people, books, films, proverbs, etc. and writings about them. The website aims to be as accurate as possible regarding the provenance and sourcing of the quotations.[citation needed] Initially, the project operated only in English from July 2003, expanding to include other languages in July 2004. As of April 2024, there are active Wikiquote sites for 73 languages comprising a total of 318,529 articles and 2,173 recently active editors.
