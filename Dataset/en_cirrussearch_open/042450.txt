Radric Delantic Davis (born February 12, 1980), known professionally as Gucci Mane, is an American rapper and record executive. He is credited, along with fellow Atlanta-based rappers T.I. and Jeezy, with pioneering the hip hop subgenre trap music for mainstream audiences into the 2000s. His debut studio album, Trap House (2005) was released by the independent label Big Cat Records and entered the Billboard 200; it was followed by Hard to Kill (2006), which spawned his first Billboard Hot 100 entry with its 2007 single, "Freaky Gurl". That same year, he released his third album, Trap-A-Thon before signing with Atlantic Records to release his fourth album, Back to the Trap House (2007). During this time, he continued to release a number of independent mixtapes to regional acclaim. Davis signed with Atlantic's sister label, Warner Bros. Records to release his sixth album and major label debut, The State vs. Radric Davis (2009). Preceded by the double platinum-certified single "Lemonade", it peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200, while the album's sequel, The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted (2010) peaked at number four. Following a two year incarceration between 2014 and 2016, he re-emerged with several retail projects beginning with his ninth album, Everybody Looking (2016), which peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. He guest appeared on Rae Sremmurd's single "Black Beatles" that same year, which became his first song to peak atop the Billboard Hot 100. Gucci Mane has released sixteen studio albums and seventy-one mixtapes since embarking on his career in 2001. He founded the Atlantic Records-distributed label imprint 1017 Records in 2007, which has signed artists including Young Thug, Waka Flocka Flame, Chief Keef, and Pooh Shiesty, among others. Throughout his career, he has worked with artists spanning numerous genres, including the Weeknd, Drake, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown, Selena Gomez, Mariah Carey, Usher, Bruno Mars, and Marilyn Manson. His prolific output and influence has earned him the titles of "[an] avatar of East Atlanta," and "the most influential underground rapper of the 2000s". He was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2020.
