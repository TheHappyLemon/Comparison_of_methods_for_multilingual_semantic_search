The Divoká Orlice (Polish: Dzika Orlica, German: Wilde Adler) is a river in the Czech Republic and Poland. It flows through Lower Silesian Voivodeship in Poland and through the Hradec Králové and Pardubice regions. It is the upper and middle course of the Orlice, but usually it is considered a separate river. Until its confluence with the Tichá Orlice, when it further continues as Orlice, the Divoká Orlice is 99.3 km (61.7 mi) long.
