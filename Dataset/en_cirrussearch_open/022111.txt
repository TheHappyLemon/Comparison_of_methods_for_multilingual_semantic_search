Latvia competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, from 7 to 23 February 2014. The Latvian team consisted of 58 athletes in nine sports. These were the third consecutive games the country qualified to send 58 athletes. Ice hockey player Vitalijs Pavlovs tested positive for methylhexaneamine and was thrown out of the Olympics. Latvia originally won two silver medals and two bronze medals. In November 2017, the Russian Bobsleigh teams that came first and fourth in the four-man event, was disqualified. In addition, the Russian Bobsleigh teams that came first and fourth in the two-man event, was also disqualified. This meant Latvia moved from the original 5th place to the bronze medal position in the two-man event and from the original silver medal to the gold medal position in the four-man event respectively. The IOC requested that the FIBT modify the results, and the medals were redistributed accordingly. Also, the gold medal in the four-man Bobsleigh event is Latvia's first Winter Olympic gold medal.
