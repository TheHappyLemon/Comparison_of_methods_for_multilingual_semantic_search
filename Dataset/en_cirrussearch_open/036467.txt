Esteban José Jean-Pierre Ocon-Khelfane (French: [ɛs.te.ban ɔ.kɔ̃]; born 17 September 1996) is a French racing driver currently competing in Formula One for Alpine. Ocon experienced a successful junior career as he won the 2014 FIA Formula 3 European Championship and the 2015 GP3 Series despite only winning one race in the latter campaign, which earned him a place at the Mercedes driver development programme, for whom he worked as a reserve driver. After winning the GP3 title, Ocon made his Formula One debut for Manor Racing in the 2016 Belgian Grand Prix, replacing Rio Haryanto. He moved to Force India/Racing Point in 2017, partnering Mexican driver Sergio Pérez for the 2017 and 2018 Formula 1 seasons. Ocon left Racing Point at the end of 2018, and became a reserve driver for Mercedes in 2019 until his move to Renault for 2020. He took his maiden Formula One podium at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix and maiden victory at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix. Despite not winning a race or taking a podium in 2022, he secured his best position in the drivers' standings in eighth with 92 points, 11 points clear of teammate Fernando Alonso, helping to secure fourth in the Constructors' Championship for Alpine. Ocon scored his third podium at the Monaco Grand Prix the following year, though he finished the season in twelfth in the drivers' standings, scoring 58 points.
