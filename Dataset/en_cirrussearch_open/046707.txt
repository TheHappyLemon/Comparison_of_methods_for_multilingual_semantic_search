Philanthropy is a form of altruism that consists of "private initiatives for the public good, focusing on quality of life".[attribution needed] Philanthropy contrasts with business initiatives, which are private initiatives for private good, focusing on material gain; and with government endeavors that are public initiatives for public good, such as those that focus on the provision of public services. A person who practices philanthropy is a philanthropist.
