The ZX Spectrum (UK: /zɛd ɛks/) is an 8-bit home computer, developed by UK company Sinclair Research, and first released in 1982. It is one of the most influential computers ever made, and it is also one of the best selling computers ever, with over five million units sold. The machine was designed by a small team in Cambridge, England. It was intended to be small, simple, and most importantly inexpensive, with as few components as possible. ZX Spectrum was intended to be used in conjunction with a contemporary television set, rather than a dedicated monitor, while software was to be loaded and saved onto compact audio cassettes. The addendum "Spectrum" was chosen to highlight the machine's colour display, which differed from the black-and-white display of its predecessor, the ZX81. It was first released in the United Kingdom on 23 April 1982, and around the world in the following years, most notably in Europe, the United States, and Eastern Bloc countries. Ultimately, the Spectrum was released as six different models, not including many official and un-official clones. Throughout its life, the machine primarily competed with the Commodore 64, BBC Micro, Dragon 32, and the Amstrad CPC range. Over 24,000 different software products were released for the ZX Spectrum. The ZX Spectrum played a pivotal role in the early history of personal computing and video gaming, leaving an enduring legacy that influenced generations. It was among the first home computers aimed at a mainstream audience. Until the Raspberry Pi, the Spectrum retained the title of Britain's best-selling computer for over three decades. It was discontinued in 1992.
