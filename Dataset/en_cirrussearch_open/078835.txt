Dione (/daɪˈoʊni/), also designated Saturn IV, is the fourth-largest moon of Saturn. Its trailing hemisphere is marked by large ice cliffs called chasmata and is also darkened compared to the leading hemisphere. Based on its density, Dione’s interior is likely a combination of silicate rock and water ice in nearly equal parts by mass. The moon was discovered by Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1684 and is named after the Titaness Dione in Greek mythology.
