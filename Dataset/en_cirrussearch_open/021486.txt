European route E 75 is part of the International E-road network, which is a series of main roads in Europe. The E 75 starts at the town of Vardø in Norway by the Barents Sea, and it runs south through Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, North Macedonia, and Greece. The road ends after about 4,380 kilometres (2,720 mi) (not counting ferries) at the town of Sitia on the eastern end of the island of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea, it being the most southerly point reached by an E-road. (The northernmost one is E69.) From the beginning of the 1990s until 2009, there was no ferry connection between Helsinki and Gdańsk. However, Finnlines started a regular service between Helsinki and Gdynia. It is also possible to take a ferry from Helsinki to Tallinn and drive along the E67 from Tallinn to Piotrków Trybunalski in Poland and then continue with the E75.
