St. Kliment Ohridski Base (Bulgarian: База Св. Климент Охридски, romanized: Baza Sv. Kliment Ohridski, IPA: [ˈbazɐ svɛˈti ˈklimɛnt ˈɔxritski]) is a Bulgarian Antarctic base on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands. The base, originally known as Sofia University Refuge or Hemus Base, was named in 1993 for medieval Bulgarian scholar St. Clement of Ohrid (840–916). The name is often shortened by non-Bulgarians to Ohridski Base, and sometimes misspelled as Ohridiski.
