Day of the Restoration of Latvian Independence (Latvian: Latvijas Republikas Neatkarības atjaunošanas diena) is a Latvian national holiday and event, being celebrated annually on 4 May. It marks, like the other Baltic republics, the restoration of the Latvian Republic declaration by the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR on 4 May 1990. This was the official declaration of the Restoration of Independence, and the actual one, that brought also the international recognition, was adopted as a constitutional law "On the Statehood of the Republic of Latvia" by Latvian Supreme Council on 21 August 1991, a day after the Restoration Act of Estonia during August coup. Soviet Union recognised Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania as independent states on 6 September 1991. Russian SFSR did so already on 24 August 1991.
