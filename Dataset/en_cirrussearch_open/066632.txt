Utøya: July 22 (Norwegian: Utøya 22. juli), also known as U – July 22 (the title used at the 2018 Berlinale), is a 2018 Norwegian drama film directed by Erik Poppe and written by Anna Bache-Wiig and Siv Rajendram Eliassen. It is based on the Utøya summer camp massacre that took place on 22 July 2011, but the characters are fictional. The purpose of Utøya: July 22 is to promote understanding of the victims by showing the massacre from their perspective. The film was created in close dialogue with over 40 survivors, to get the action as close to reality as possible. Most of the film consists of a single take, shot in real time, and follows the character Kaja from the third-person perspective before and throughout the 72-minute attack. The terrorist is a figure in the periphery throughout the film, and is only briefly seen two times.
