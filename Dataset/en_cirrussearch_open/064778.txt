Gianpiero Combi (Italian pronunciation: [dʒamˈpjɛːro ˈkombi]; 20 November 1902 – 12 August 1956) was an Italian footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He spent his entire club career at Juventus, where he won five Italian League titles. At international level, he won the 1934 World Cup with the Italy national team, as well as two Central European International Cups (in 1930 and 1935), and an Olympic bronze medal in 1928. Combi was considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world during the 1930s, alongside Ricardo Zamora and František Plánička, and is regarded as one of Italy's best ever goalkeepers; in a 1999 IFFHS poll, he was elected Italy's second best goalkeeper of the twentieth century, behind only Dino Zoff, and the sixteenth greatest European goalkeeper of the century, alongside Rinat Dasayev.
