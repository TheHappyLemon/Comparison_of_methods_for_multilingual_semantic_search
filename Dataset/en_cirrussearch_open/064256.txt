Jarhead is a 2005 American biographical war drama film based on the 2003 memoir of the same name by Anthony Swofford, chronicling his military service in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War. Directed by Sam Mendes, the film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford with Jamie Foxx, Peter Sarsgaard, Lucas Black, and Chris Cooper. Universal Pictures released the film November 4, 2005 to mixed reviews and a disappointing box office, grossing $97 million against a $72 million budget. Named for the military slang among U.S. Marines, the film eventually spawned a direct-to-video series of three subsequent films.
