The Warsaw Metro (Polish: Metro Warszawskie) is a rapid transit underground system serving the Polish capital Warsaw. It currently consists of two lines, the north–south Line M1 which links central Warsaw with its densely populated northern and southern districts, and the east–west Line M2. Three more lines (M3, M4 and M5) are still being planned. The system is operated by Metro Warszawskie sp. z o.o., a company owned by the city, and managed by Zarząd Transportu Miejskiego w Warszawie (ZTM Warszawa). As of 2024 it is the only metro system in Poland. The first section of M1 was opened in 1995 and the line was gradually extended until it reached its full length in October 2008. There are plans to construct two more stations on this north–south line: Plac Konstytucji and Muranów. The contract for the construction of the initial central section of M2, running east–west, was signed on 28 October 2009 and construction began on 16 August 2010. The initial segment of M2 was opened on 8 March 2015. This section was 6.3 kilometres (3.9 miles) long (including a tunnel under the Vistula river) with seven stations, one of which (Świętokrzyska) includes a transfer between the two lines. The line was extended in 2019, 2020, and 2022. The line is expected to be completed in 2026, when it will have 21 stations. In 2009, the Warsaw Metro won two "Metro Award" prizes in the categories of "Special Merit Award for Commitment to the Environment" and "Best Maintenance Programme". These were followed by the Most Improved Metro award in 2011. The system consistently receives very high ratings among its passengers; a survey conducted in September 2014 indicated that 98% of the respondents rated it as good or very good.
