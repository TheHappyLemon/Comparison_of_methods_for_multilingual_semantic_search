Domo–Farm Frites was a Belgian professional road cycling team that existed in the 2001–02 road cycling seasons. It was founded by Patrick Lefevere and the bulk of the Belgian riders from the Mapei team, including Johan Museeuw. Sponsor Farm Frites had previously co-sponsored TVM. The team won several notable one-day races in their existence, notably including a podium sweep of 2001 Paris–Roubaix led by Servais Knaven, 2002 Paris–Roubaix by Johan Museeuw, and 2001 Paris–Tours by Richard Virenque. At the end of the 2002 season the team merged with the remnants of the disbanded Mapei team and became Quick-Step–Davitamon, with Lefevere at the helm. Sponsor Domo joined Lotto to co-sponsor team Lotto–Domo, with Marc Sergeant as team manager and taking several riders with him.
