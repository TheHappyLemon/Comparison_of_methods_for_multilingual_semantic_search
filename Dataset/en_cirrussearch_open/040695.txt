The Slovenes, also known as Slovenians (Slovene: Slovenci [slɔˈʋéːntsi]), are a South Slavic ethnic group native to Slovenia, and adjacent regions in Italy, Austria and Hungary. Slovenes share a common ancestry, culture, history and speak Slovene as their native language. They are closely related to other South Slavic ethnic groups, as well as more distantly to West Slavs. Outside of Slovenia and Europe, Slovenes form diaspora groups in the United States, Canada, Argentina and Brazil.
