The ammonium cation is a positively charged polyatomic ion with the chemical formula NH+4 or [NH4]+. It is formed by the protonation of ammonia (NH3). Ammonium is also a general name for positively charged (protonated) substituted amines and quaternary ammonium cations ([NR4]+), where one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by organic or other groups (indicated by R).
