The Tebra is a river in the South Kurzeme Municipality of Latvia, in the region of Courland. It originates from Podnieki Lake Kalvene Parish. Most of the river flow is from the hills of western Latvia (Bandavas Hills and Apricot Plain). In the middle of the river there is a pronounced valley, which reaches depth of 10–20 m and has many ponds. There is a water reservoir (mill pond) Aizpute. The main tributaries are the rivers Aloxte (right) and Grabstes (left). Near the settlement of Saka the river merges with the Durbe, forming the Saka River. On the banks of the Tebra river there are several large populated areas: Aizpute, Štakeldanga, Apriki. The river is crossed by the P112 motorway.
