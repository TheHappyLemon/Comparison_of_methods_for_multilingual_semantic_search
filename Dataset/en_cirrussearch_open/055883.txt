Leo Anthony Gallagher Jr. (July 24, 1946 â€“ November 11, 2022), known simply as Gallagher, was an American comedian who became one of the most recognizable comedic performers of the 1980s for his prop and observational routine that included the signature act of smashing a watermelon on stage with a wooden sledgehammer. For more than 30 years, he played between 100 and 200 shows a year, destroying tens of thousands of melons with the sledgehammer he called the "Sledge-O-Matic". This last sketch was meant to poke fun at infomercials who peddled similarly inane products and whose popularity apexed in the late 1970s/early '80s before waning during the '90s.
