Pascal Wehrlein (German pronunciation: [pasˈkal ˈveːɐ̯.laɪ̯n]; born 18 October 1994) is a German and Mauritian racing driver currently competing in Formula E for Porsche. He previously raced in Formula One for the Sauber and Manor teams. Holding dual nationality of Germany and Mauritius, he raced under the German flag in Formula One. He had previously raced in DTM, winning the title with the Mercedes-Benz team HWA AG in 2015. In 2013, Wehrlein became the youngest driver to start a DTM race at the age of 18, in 2014, he became the youngest driver to take pole position and a race win at the age of 19, and the following year, he was the youngest to win the title, at the age of 20. In February 2016 he began driving full-time in Formula One for Manor, scoring his first and the team's only championship point at the Austrian Grand Prix. During the season, he regularly outperformed his lesser rated team mate Rio Haryanto, until Haryanto was replaced mid-season by Esteban Ocon. Manor folded in early 2017 and Wehrlein moved to Sauber. Before the season began, he broke three thoracic vertebrae in an accident at the Race of Champions, which left him unable to compete in the first two races of the season. Despite scoring all of Sauber's points that year, he was not retained for the 2018 season, his seat going to Ferrari Driver Academy member Charles Leclerc instead. In 2018, Wehrlein returned to DTM with Mercedes while also acting as their reserve driver in Formula One, but parted ways with the German manufacturer at the end of the year. He then worked as a development driver for Ferrari in 2019 and 2020. Wehrlein made the switch to Formula E ahead of the 2018-19 season, joining Mahindra Racing. He left the team midway through the 2019-20 season, having signed a long-term deal to race for Porsche from the 2020-21 season onwards.
