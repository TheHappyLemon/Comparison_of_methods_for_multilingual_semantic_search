Breakout is the second studio album by American singer Miley Cyrus, released on July 22, 2008, by Hollywood Records. Despite being her second album, it is her first record not affiliated with the television series Hannah Montana, as Meet Miley Cyrus was released as part of a joint album with her character. The majority of the record was composed as she traveled during her headlining Best of Both Worlds Tour (2007â€“08). Overall, Breakout is dominant on pop rock but explores a variety of other musical genres. Lyrical themes addressed in the album relate to breakups and coming of age. Most of the album was produced by Rock Mafia. Matthew Wiler and Scott Cutler also produced. Cyrus co-wrote eight out of thirteen tracks. Breakout was met with generally favorable reception from music critics, though some believed the tracks were not a significant departure from the Hannah Montana franchise. The album encountered commercial success and introduced Cyrus in new countries. The album peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 for one week selling 370,000 copies, also becoming the third solo artist to chart on the Billboard 200 under age eighteen twice, and seventh overall. It is Cyrus' third album to do so, and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elsewhere, Breakout topped the Canadian Albums Chart for two consecutive weeks and the Australian Albums Chart for one week. The album also charted within the top ten in Hungary, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. Three singles were released from Breakout. "7 Things" was released on June 17, 2008, as the lead single from the album; it was commercially successful, reaching the top ten on charts in various countries. The second single, "Fly on the Wall" was released on November 4, 2008, as the final single.
