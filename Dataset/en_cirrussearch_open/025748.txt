Zole (diminutive Zolīte) is a Latvian trick-taking cooperative card game for 3 to 5 players. The game belongs to the Schafkopf group of ace–ten games, i.e. jacks and queens are permanent trumps in the game. Zole is played using only 26 cards of a 32-card piquet deck or French-style deck, consisting of 36 cards. Six or ten cards are removed from the deck and left out of play. Official rules and terminology were published by the Latvian Zole Game Federation (LZSF) in 1996.
