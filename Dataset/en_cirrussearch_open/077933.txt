The Tao Te Ching (traditional Chinese: 道德經; simplified Chinese: 道德经) is a Chinese classic text and foundational work of Taoism traditionally credited to the sage Laozi, though the text's authorship, date of composition and date of compilation are debated. The oldest excavated portion dates to the late 4th century BC, but modern scholarship dates other parts of the text as having been at least compiled later than the earliest portions of the Zhuangzi, the other foundational text of Taoism. The Tao Te Ching is central to both philosophical and religious conceptions of Taoism, and has had great influence beyond Taoism as such on Chinese philosophy and religious practice throughout history. Terminology originating in the Tao Te Ching has be reinterpreted and elaborated upon by Legalist thinkers, Confucianists, and particularly Chinese Buddhists, which had been introduced to China significantly after the initial solidification of Taoist thought. Artists including painters, calligraphers, and gardeners have found inspiration within the work,[citation needed] and it is comparatively well known in the West. It is one of the most translated texts in world literature.
