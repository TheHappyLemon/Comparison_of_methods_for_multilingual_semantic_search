Shrewsbury (/ˈʃroʊzbəri/ SHROHZ-bər-ee, also /ˈʃruːz-/ SHROOZ-) is a market town, civil parish and the county town of Shropshire, England, on the River Severn, 150 miles (240 km) north-west of London. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 76,782. Shrewsbury has Saxon roots and institutions whose foundations dating from that time represent a cultural continuity possibly going back as far as the 8th century. The centre has a largely undisturbed medieval street plan and over 660 listed buildings, including several examples of timber framing from the 15th and 16th centuries. Shrewsbury Castle, a red sandstone fortification, and Shrewsbury Abbey, were founded in 1074 and 1083 respectively by the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, Roger de Montgomery. The town is the birthplace of Charles Darwin. It has had a role in nurturing aspects of English culture, including drama, ballet, dance and pantomime. Located 9 miles (14 km) east of the Welsh border, Shrewsbury serves as the commercial centre for Shropshire and parts of mid-Wales, with a retail output of over £299 million per year and light industry and distribution centres, such as Battlefield Enterprise Park, on the outskirts. The A5 and A49 trunk roads come together as the town's by-pass and five railway lines meet at Shrewsbury railway station.
