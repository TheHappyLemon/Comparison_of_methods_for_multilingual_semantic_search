In zoology and developmental anatomy, the notochord is an elastic, rod-like anatomical structure found in many deuterostomal animals. A notochord is one of five synapomorphies used to define a species as a chordate. The notochord is derived from the embryonic mesoderm and consists of an inner core of vacuolated cells filled with glycoproteins, covered by two helical collagen-elastin sheaths. It lies along the rostral-caudal axis of the body (i.e. longitudinally or "head to tail"), dorsal to the gut tube and ventral to the dorsal nerve cord. Some chordates, such as tunicates, develop notochord during the larval stage but lose it through subsequent stages into adulthood. The most commonly cited functions of the notochord are: as a midline staple that provides directional reference to surrounding tissue during embryonic development, as a primitive axial endoskeleton (structural element) and a vertebral precursor, and as an elastic spring that allows more efficient tail motion when swimming.
