The Latvia women's national football team (Latvian: Latvijas sievie≈°u futbola izlase) represents Latvia in international football and is controlled by the Latvian Football Federation, the governing body for football in Latvia. They have never qualified for the major tournament. Latvia, alongside their Baltic rivals, Lithuania and Estonia, is also participating in the local sub-regional Women's Baltic Cup, which takes place every year. Latvia has won this tournament five times, the first time in 1997. The next moment of triumph had to wait until 2011, and in 2017, 2018 and 2019 Latvia won the trophy three years in a row.
