The 76th annual Cannes Film Festival took place from 16 to 27 May 2023. Swedish filmmaker Ruben Östlund served as jury president. With the French film Anatomy of a Fall winning the Palme d'Or, the festival's top prize, Justine Triet became the third female director to achieve the prize, after Jane Campion in 1993, and Julia Ducournau in 2021. The official poster for the festival featuring actress Catherine Deneuve was created by Lionel Avignon and Stefan de Vivies of the design studio Hartland Villa from a photo taken by Jack Garofalo during the shooting of La Chamade (1968). The poster was chosen to pay tribute to Deneuve for her contributions to film. During the festival, two Honorary Palme d'Or were awarded: the first one during the opening ceremony for Michael Douglas, and the second one was awarded on short notice for Harrison Ford before the world premiere of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The festival opened with Jeanne du Barry directed by Maïwenn and closed with Pixar's feature film Elemental directed by Peter Sohn.
