Sheremetyevo Alexander S. Pushkin International Airport (Russian: Международный аэропорт Шереметьево имени А. С. Пушкина, tr. Mezhdunarodny aeroport Sheremetyevo imeni A. S. Pushkina, IPA: [ʂɨrʲɪˈmʲetʲjɪvə]) (IATA: SVO, ICAO: UUEE) is one of four international airports that serve the city of Moscow. It is the busiest airport in Russia, as well as the 13th-busiest airport in Europe. Originally built as a military airbase, Sheremetyevo was converted into a civilian airport in 1959. The airport was originally named after a nearby village, and a 2019 contest extended the name to include the name of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The airport comprises six terminals: four international terminals (one under construction), one domestic terminal, and one private aviation terminal. It is located 29 km (18 mi) northwest of central Moscow, between towns of Lobnya and Khimki in Moscow Oblast. In 2019, the airport handled about 49.9 million passengers. Sheremetyevo serves as the main hub for Russian flag carrier Aeroflot as well as its subsidiaries Rossiya Airlines and Pobeda, for Nordwind Airlines and its subsidiariy Pegas Fly and for Smartavia.
