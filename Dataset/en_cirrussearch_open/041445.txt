Snowboarding at the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Bokwang Phoenix Park and Alpensia Ski Jumping Stadium in Pyeongchang, South Korea. A total of ten snowboarding events were scheduled to take place between 10 and 24 February 2018. The parallel slalom event, which made its debut four years earlier at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, was dropped from the games in 2018 in favour of a new big air event.
