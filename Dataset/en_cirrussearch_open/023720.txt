SRAM LLC is a privately owned bicycle component manufacturer based in Chicago, Illinois, United States, founded in 1987. SRAM is an acronym comprising the names of its founders, Scott, Ray, sAM, (where Ray is the middle name of the company's first CEO, Stan Day). The company produces a range of internally developed cycling components, including Grip Shift, separate gravel, road, and mountain drivetrains from 7 to 12 speed (depending on the range). SRAM developed the Eagle line of mountain bike specific drivetrain components intended to improve shifting performance. SRAM was also the first to release a dedicated "one by" drivetrain with a single front chain-ring. The company grew organically and through acquisitions to become a cycling component brand, selling under the brands SRAM, Avid, RockShox, Truvativ, Quarq, Zipp, TIME Sport pedals, Hammerhead cycling computers and Velocio cycling apparel. Their components are manufactured primarily in-house, in factories located in the U.S., Germany and Taiwan, being distributed and sold as Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) equipment and aftermarket components.
