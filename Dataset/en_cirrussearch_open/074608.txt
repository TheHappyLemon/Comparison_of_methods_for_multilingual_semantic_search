"Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm" (IPA: [mu ˈisɑmɑː mu ˈɤnʲː jɑ ˈrɤːm]; lit. "My Fatherland, My Happiness and Joy") is the national anthem of Estonia. It was adopted as the national anthem ((riigi)hümn) in 1920. The lyrics were written by Johann Voldemar Jannsen and are set to a melody composed in 1848 by Fredrik (Friedrich) Pacius which is also that of the national anthem of Finland: "Maamme" (Swedish: Vårt land, which was the unofficial anthem of the Grand Duchy of Finland). The only differences between the two anthems are their key signature and the repetition of the last four lines of each verse in the Finnish anthem. It is also considered to be an ethnic anthem for Livonian people with text "Min izāmō".
