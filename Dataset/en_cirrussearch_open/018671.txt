Hindūstān (pronunciation) is the Persian name for India, broadly referring to the Indian subcontinent. Being the Iranic cognate of the Indic word Sindhu, it originally referred to the land of lower Indus basin (present-day Sindh). Later, the term referred to the Indo-Gangetic plain, and became the classical name of the region in Hindi-Urdu. It finally referred to the entire subcontinent since the early modern period. Since the Partition of India in 1947, Hindustan continues to be used to the present day as a historic name for the Republic of India. The Arabic equivalent of the term is Hind. The two terms are used synonymously in Hindu-Urdu. Hindustan was also commonly spelt as Hindostan.
