Therese Charlotte Luise of Saxony-Hildburghausen (8 July 1792 â€“ 26 October 1854) was queen of Bavaria as the wife of King Ludwig I. Oktoberfest was created in honour of their wedding and is still celebrated annually on Theresienwiese in Munich. Therese was popular amongst the people of Bavaria, and was heavily involved in her husband's politics, as well as her own charity work.
