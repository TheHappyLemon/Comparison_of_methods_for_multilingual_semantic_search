Tom and Jerry: Spy Quest is a 2015 American animated direct-to-video action comedy film produced by Warner Bros. Animation. Despite the film being purposed for the Tom and Jerry franchise, it is a crossover between Tom and Jerry and Hanna-Barbera's Jonny Quest and served as a direct sequel to the original 1964 series. It is also the first Jonny Quest entry produced without the assistance of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who died in 2001 and 2006 respectively. It was originally released digitally on June 9, 2015, followed by a DVD release on June 23, 2015. In this film, Jonny Quest's original voice actor, Tim Matheson, is involved.
