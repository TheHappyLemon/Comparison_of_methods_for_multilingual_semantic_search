The Temple of Athena Alea was a sanctuary at Tegea in Ancient Greece, dedicated to Athena under the epithet Athena Alea; a syncretization between the Olympian goddess Athena and the local deity Alea. It was a significant Greek temple, and played a crucial part as an identity marker for the ancient Tegeans. It served as the focal point of a significant area already from tenth century BCE, and has provided evidence of contact with several nearby regions such as the Argolid and Laconia.
