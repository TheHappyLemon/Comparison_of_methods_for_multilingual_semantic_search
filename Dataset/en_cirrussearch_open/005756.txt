UTC+08:00 is an identifier for a time offset from UTC of +08:00. With an estimated population of 1.708 billion living within the time zone, roughly 21% of the world population, it is the most populous time zone in the world, as well as a possible candidate for ASEAN Common Time. This time zone is used in all predominantly Chinese-speaking regions, giving international Chinese websites and TV channels the same time. In Indonesia, it is known as Central Indonesian Time (Indonesian: Waktu Indonesia Tengah / WITA) while in Western Australia, it is known as Australian Western Standard Time.
