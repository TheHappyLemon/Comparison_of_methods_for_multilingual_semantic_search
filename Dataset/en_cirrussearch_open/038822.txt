The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual international song competition, held every year by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) since 1956. This page is a list of people who have acted as presenters of the contest. Since 1988, it has been the norm to have at least two presenters for the contest. All contests before 1978, while only three after 1988 (i.e. the 1993, 1995 and 2013 contests), have had one presenter. The 1999 contest was the first to feature three presenters, a method that has been used most often since 2010. The contests from 2018 to 2021 all had four presenters each. Katie Boyle holds the record for the highest number of contests hosted, with four editions (in 1960, 1963, 1968 and 1974), followed by Petra Mede with two editions (2013 and 2016, and is set to host a third time in 2024) and a special (Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits in 2015).
