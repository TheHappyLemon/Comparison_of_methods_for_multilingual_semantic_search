The 12th Army was a field army of the Imperial Russian Army during World War I that fought on the Eastern Front. Its field headquarters was established in January 1915. In August 1915, the entire staff of the 12th Army was replaced by that of the 13th Army, which itself ceased to exist. The unit was assigned to the Northwestern Front and later to the Northern Front, being disbanded by the end of 1917.
