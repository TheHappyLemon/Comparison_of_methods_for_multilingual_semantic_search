Oskar Dirlewanger (26 September 1895 – c. 7 June 1945) was a German military officer (SS-Oberführer) known for his alleged war crimes. He played a significant role as the founder and commander of the SS penal unit known as the "Dirlewanger" during World War II. Serving in Poland and Belarus, Dirlewanger is closely linked to many atrocities, being considered one of the most cruel and brutal individuals throughout the course of World War II, with his unit being responsible for the deaths of at least "tens of thousands" in Poland and Russia. He also fought in World War I, the post-World War I conflicts, and the Spanish Civil War. He reportedly died after World War II while in Allied custody. According to the historian Timothy Snyder, "in all the theaters of the Second World War, few could compete in cruelty with Dirlewanger". He has been described as the "most evil man in the SS" and "perhaps the most sadistic of all commanders of World War II".
