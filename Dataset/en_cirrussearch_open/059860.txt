The Straits of Tiran (Arabic: مضيق تيران Maḍīq Tīrān) are the narrow sea passages between the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas that connect the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea. The distance between the two peninsulas is about 13 km (7 nautical miles). The Multinational Force and Observers monitors the compliance of Egypt in maintaining freedom of navigation of the straits, as provided under the Egypt–Israel peace treaty. The body is named after Tiran Island, located at its entrance 5 or 6 km (3 or 4 mi) from the Sinai. Sanafir Island lies to the east of Tiran, southeast of the shallow strait between Tiran and Saudi Arabia. The blockade of Israeli passage through the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran led to two wars, in 1956 and 1967.
