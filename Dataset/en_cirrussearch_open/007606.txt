Luke Schenn (born November 2, 1989) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL). Schenn played junior hockey with the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League (WHL). In his final WHL season, Schenn was named to the League's Second All-Star Team. He was a highly touted prospect heading into the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, where he was selected in the first round, fifth overall, by the Toronto Maple Leafs. Schenn began his professional career in the NHL during the 2008–09 season and played with the Maple Leafs until being traded to Philadelphia following the 2011–12 season. After his rookie season, Schenn's play was recognized when he was named to the NHL's All-Rookie Team. Schenn won back-to-back Stanley Cups with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2020 and 2021. He has represented Canada internationally, winning a gold medal at the 2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and a silver medal at the 2009 World Ice Hockey Championships. Schenn is a stay-at-home defenceman whose main focus is preventing goals rather than scoring. With a physical style of play and legendary “old man strength”, he is usually among NHL leaders in hits and is the NHL's all-time record holder for most hits by a defenceman. When he played in Toronto his charity "Luke's Troops" helped military families attend Maple Leafs home games. His younger brother Brayden was also drafted fifth overall in 2009, and currently serves as the captain of the St. Louis Blues.
