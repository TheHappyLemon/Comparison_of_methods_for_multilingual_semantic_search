Narva-Jõesuu is a seaside resort town in northeastern Estonia by the Gulf of Finland of the Baltic Sea. Administratively part of Ida-Viru County, it is located on the west bank of the Narva River, which forms the Estonia–Russia international border. The town's historical name variants in both Estonian (Narva jõe-suu) and Russian (Усть-Нарова, Ust'-Narova) literally mean 'mouth of Narva River'.
