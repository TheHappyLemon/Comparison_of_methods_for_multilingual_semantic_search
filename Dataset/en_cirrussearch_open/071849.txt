Do Revenge is a 2022 American teen black comedy film directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Celeste Ballard. It stars Camila Mendes, Maya Hawke, Austin Abrams, Rish Shah, and Sarah Michelle Gellar, and it is loosely inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train (1951) and Patricia Highsmith's novel Strangers on a Train, which Hitchcock's film was based on. It was released on Netflix on September 16, 2022, and received generally positive reviews from critics. Robinson pays homage to several 1990s high school films and other teen classics such as Heathers (1989) and Mean Girls (2004).
