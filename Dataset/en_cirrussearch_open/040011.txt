Acetoacetic acid (IUPAC name: 3-Oxobutanoic acid, also known as Acetonecarboxylic acid or Diacetic acid) is the organic compound with the formula CH3COCH2COOH. It is the simplest beta-keto acid, and like other members of this class, it is unstable. The methyl and ethyl esters, which are quite stable, are produced on a large scale industrially as precursors to dyes. Acetoacetic acid is a weak acid.
