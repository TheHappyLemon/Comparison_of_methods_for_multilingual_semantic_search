The Christadelphians (/ˌkrɪstəˈdɛlfiənz/) are a restorationist and nontrinitarian Christian denomination. The name means 'brothers and sisters in Christ', from the Greek words for Christ (Christos) and brothers (adelphoi). Christadelphians believe in the inspiration of the Bible, the Virgin Birth, the sonship of Jesus Christ, believer's baptism, the resurrection of the dead, the second coming of Christ, and the future kingdom of God on earth. However, they reject a number of mainstream Christian doctrines, for example the Trinity and the immortality of the soul, believing these to be corruptions of original Christian teaching. The movement developed in the United Kingdom and North America in the 19th century around the teachings of John Thomas and they were initially found predominantly in the developed English-speaking world, expanding in developing countries after the Second World War. There are approximately 50,000 Christadelphians in around 120 countries. Congregations are traditionally referred to as "ecclesias".
