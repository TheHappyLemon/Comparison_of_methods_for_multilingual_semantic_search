The 2018 Tour of the Basque Country was a road cycling stage race that took place between 2 and 7 April 2018 in Spain. It was the 58th edition of the Tour of the Basque Country and the fourteenth event of the 2018 UCI World Tour. The race was won by a Slovenian rider for the first time, as Primož Roglič (LottoNL–Jumbo) was the most consistent rider over the course of the week. Aside from winning the individual time trial in Lodosa, Roglič finished second on three other stages, cementing the green jersey for the points classification alongside the txapela and yellow jersey for the general classification; Roglič won the race overall by over a minute from his next closest competitor, the Movistar Team's Mikel Landa. Landa, and third-placed Ion Izagirre (Bahrain–Merida), had moved onto the overall podium on the race's penultimate stage, having been a part of a six-rider breakaway in the closing stages. The race's other jerseys were won by Spaniards Carlos Verona (mountains for Mitchelton–Scott), and Enric Mas (young rider for Quick-Step Floors after a final-stage breakaway win), while the Movistar Team won the teams classification as Nairo Quintana also finished in the top-five overall for the team.
