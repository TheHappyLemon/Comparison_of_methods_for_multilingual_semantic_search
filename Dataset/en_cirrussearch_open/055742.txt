Romy Schneider (German: [ˈʁoː.mi ˈʃnaɪ̯.dɐ] ; born Rosemarie Magdalena Albach; 23 September 1938 – 29 May 1982) was a German-French actress. She is regarded as one of the greatest screen actresses of all time and became a cult figure due to her role as Empress Elisabeth of Austria in the hugely popular Sissi trilogy in the mid-1950s. Later reprised the role in a more mature version in Luchino Visconti's Ludwig (1973). She began her career in the German Heimatfilm genre in the early 1950s when she was 15. Schneider moved to France, where she made successful and critically acclaimed films with some of the most notable film directors of that era. Her performance in That Most Important Thing: Love is regarded as one of the greatest in the history of cinema. Coco Chanel called Romy “the ultimate incarnation of the ideal woman”
