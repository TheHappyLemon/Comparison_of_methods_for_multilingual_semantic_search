Jazeps Grosvalds (Latvian: Jāzeps Grosvalds) (24 April 1891 – 1 February 1920) was a Latvian painter from Riga. He is now regarded as one of Latvia's finest painters, bringing new ideas in Latvian art at the time, and has several works on display in the Latvian National Museum of Art. Although he spent most of his life abroad his style is a combination of European Modernism and Abstract with a distinctly Latvian influence.
