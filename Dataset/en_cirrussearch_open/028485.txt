Saint Pantaleon (Greek: Παντελεήμων, romanized: Panteleḗmōn, lit. 'All-compassionate'; Russian: Пантелеи́мон, romanized: Panteleímon), counted in Western Christianity as among the Fourteen Holy Helpers of the Late Middle Ages, and in Eastern Christianity as one of the Holy Unmercenary Healers, was a martyr of Nicomedia in Bithynia during the Diocletianic Persecution of 305 AD. Though there is evidence to suggest that a martyr named Pantaleon existed, some consider the stories of his life and death to be purely legendary.
