Puccinia is a genus of fungi. All species in this genus are obligate plant pathogens and are known as rusts. The genus contains about 4000 species. The genus name of Puccinia is in honour of Tommaso Puccini (died 1735), who was an Italian doctor and botanist who taught anatomy at Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence. The genus was circumscribed by Pier Antonio Micheli in Nov. Pl. Gen. on page 213 in 1729.
