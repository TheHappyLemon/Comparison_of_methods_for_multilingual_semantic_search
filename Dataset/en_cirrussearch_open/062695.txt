Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (Hungarian: Budapest Liszt Ferenc Nemzetközi Repülőtér) (IATA: BUD, ICAO: LHBP), formerly known as Budapest Ferihegy International Airport and still commonly called just Ferihegy (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈfɛrihɛɟ]), is the international airport serving the Hungarian capital city of Budapest. It is by far the largest of the country's four commercial airports, ahead of Debrecen and Hévíz–Balaton. The airport is located 16 kilometres (8+1⁄2 nautical miles) southeast of the centre of Budapest (bordering Pest county) and was renamed in 2011 in honour of the famous Hungarian composer Franz Liszt (Hungarian: Liszt Ferenc) on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of his birth. The facility covers 1,515 hectares (3,744 acres) and has two runways. It offers international connections primarily within Europe, but also to Africa, to the Middle East, and to the Far East. In 2019, the airport handled 16.2 million passengers. The airport is the headquarters and primary hub for Wizz Air and base for Ryanair. In 2012 it experienced a significant drop in aircraft movements and handled cargo, primarily due to the collapse of Malév Hungarian Airlines earlier in the year, hence lost a large portion of connecting passengers. It had been the hub for Malév until the airline's bankruptcy on 3 February 2012.
