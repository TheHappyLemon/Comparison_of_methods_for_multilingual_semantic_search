The Nokia 6120 classic is a mid-range mobile phone from Nokia that was announced on 17 April 2007. It runs on Symbian v9.2 with a S60 3rd Edition FP1 user interface. It is the first Nokia UMTS / HSDPA dual band phone which also features quad band GSM, supporting both 2G and 3G/UMTS networks. Despite its small and sleek size in a classic candybar form, it still retained standard S60 features and also has HSDPA (3.5G), the fourth from Nokia to do so after the N95, E90 and 6110 Navigator. It weighs only 89 grams. It should not be confused with Nokia 6120, a different mobile phone from 1997.
