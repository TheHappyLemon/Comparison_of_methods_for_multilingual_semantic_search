The mark was a currency or unit of account in many states. It is named for the mark unit of weight. The word mark comes from a merging of three Germanic words, Latinised in 9th-century post-classical Latin as marca, marcha, marha or marcus. It was a measure of weight mainly for gold and silver, commonly used throughout Europe and often equivalent to 8 troy ounces (250Â g). Considerable variations, however, occurred throughout the Middle Ages. As of 2022,[update] the only circulating currency named "mark" is the Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark.
