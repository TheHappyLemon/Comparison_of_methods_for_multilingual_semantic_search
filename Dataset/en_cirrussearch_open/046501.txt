K-11 is a 2012 American prison drama film co-written (with Jared Kurt) and directed by Jules Stewart. The film stars an ensemble cast of generally independent film actors including Goran Višnjić, Kate del Castillo, D. B. Sweeney, Portia Doubleday, Jason Mewes, and Tommy "Tiny" Lister. The term "K-11" refers to a dormitory section of the Los Angeles jail used to hold gay and transgender inmates. The film tells the story of Raymond Saxx Jr., a powerful record producer who wakes from a drug-induced blackout to find himself locked up and classified in the segregated "K-11" unit for LGBTQ inmates. The ward has a de facto leader who controls the black market drug trade in the unit, which is also run by a corrupt, abusive guard. Ray's struggle to contact the outside world and regain his freedom seems impossible, but he must learn to navigate the new power structure in K-11 if he is ever going to survive and get control of his life again.
