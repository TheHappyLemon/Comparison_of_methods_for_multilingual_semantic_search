Pimelic acid is the organic compound with the formula HO2C(CH2)5CO2H. Pimelic acid is one CH 2 unit longer than a related dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, a precursor to many polyesters and polyamides. However compared to adipic acid, pimelic acid is relatively small in importance industrially. Derivatives of pimelic acid are involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid lysine and the vitamin biotin.
