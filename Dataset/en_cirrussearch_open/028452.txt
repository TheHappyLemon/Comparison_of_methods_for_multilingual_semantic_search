Ukraine International Airlines PJSC, often shortened to UIA (Ukrainian: Авіакомпанія Міжнародні Авіалінії України, romanized: Aviakompaniya Mizhnarodni Avialiniyi Ukrayiny, IPA: [ɑwijɐkomˈpɑn⁽ʲ⁾ijɐ miʒnɐˈrɔd⁽ʲ⁾n⁽ʲ⁾i ˌɑwijɐˈl⁽ʲ⁾in⁽ʲ⁾iji ʊkrɐˈjinɪ]), is the flag carrier and the largest airline of Ukraine, with its head office in Kyiv and its main hub at Kyiv's Boryspil International Airport. It operates domestic and international passenger flights and cargo services to Europe, the Middle East, the United States, Canada, and Asia. Due to Russia's 2022 invasion, all flights have been cancelled since 24 February 2022. The airline has ceased all operations, and the fleet has been parked at Kyiv Boryspil with the exception of one Embraer 190, UR-EMC, parked in Odessa. The airline won't be operating until the war ends and the ban on civilian flights in Ukrainian airspace is lifted. Resumption of operations also depends on whether the fleet of aircraft - or a sufficient share of it - remains intact throughout the war.
