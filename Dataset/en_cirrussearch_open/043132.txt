Voice of America (VOA or VoA) is the state-owned news network and international radio broadcaster of the United States of America. It is the largest and oldest of the U.S.-funded international broadcasters. VOA produces digital, TV, and radio content in 49 languages, which it distributes to affiliate stations around the world. Its targeted and primary audience is non-American. As of November 2022, its reporting reached 326 million adults per week across all platforms. VOA was established in 1942, and the VOA charter was signed into law in 1976 by U.S. President Gerald Ford. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), an independent agency of the U.S. government. Funds are appropriated annually under the budget for embassies and consulates. As of 2022, VOA had a weekly worldwide audience of approximately 326 million (up from 237 million in 2016) and employed 961 staff with an annual budget of $267.5Â million. Voice of America is seen by some listeners as having a positive impact while others like lecturer Faizullah Jan of Pakistan's University of Peshawar see it as both that and in addition as American propaganda; it also serves US diplomacy.
