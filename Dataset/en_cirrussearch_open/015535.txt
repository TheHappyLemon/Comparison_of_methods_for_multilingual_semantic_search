Balticconnector is a bi-directional natural gas pipeline between Ingå, Finland and Paldiski, Estonia operated by Gasgrid Finland and Elering. It connects the Estonian and Finnish gas grids, and provides Finland with access to the Inčukalns underground gas storage facility in Latvia. In addition, the pipeline enables construction of the regional liquefied natural gas terminal. The subsea pipeline and a nearby data cable were damaged in October 2023. Early assessment is that the damage appears to have been caused by an external mechanical event.
