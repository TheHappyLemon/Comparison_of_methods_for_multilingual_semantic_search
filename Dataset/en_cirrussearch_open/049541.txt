OOCL Hong Kong was the largest container ship ever built at the time she was delivered in 2017, and the third container ship to surpass the 20,000 twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) threshold. She is also the first ship to surpass the 21,000 TEU mark. She is the lead ship of the G class, of which five other ships were built. She was built at the Samsung Heavy Industries, Geoje, shipyard with yard number 2172 and was christened and delivered in May 2017, only two months after the christening of the first ship to break the 20,000 TEU barrier, MOL Triumph. The six ships of the G-class were built within the same year at the same shipyard.
