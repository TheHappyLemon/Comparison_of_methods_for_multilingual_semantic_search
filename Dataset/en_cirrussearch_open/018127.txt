Bridgeman Island is one of the South Shetland Islands in Antarctica. It is an almost circular, volcanic island marked by steep sides, measuring 900 by 600 metres (3,000 ft × 2,000 ft) with a maximum elevation of 240 m (787 ft) high, lying 45 kilometres (28 mi) east of King George Island. It is surrounded by steep cliffs and consists mostly of lava flows and scoria, subdivided in two geological units. Bridgeman Island is the emergent portion of a larger volcano in the Bransfield Strait, which contains numerous volcanoes including Deception Island and numerous seamounts. The island formed during the Pleistocene; there is evidence of an eruption in 1821 that generated a probable tuff cone west of Bridgeman Island, which has now disappeared.
