Coelenterata is a term encompassing the animal phyla Cnidaria (coral animals, true jellies, sea anemones, sea pens, and their relatives) and Ctenophora (comb jellies). The name comes from Ancient Greek κοῖλος (koîlos) 'hollow', and ἔντερον (énteron) 'intestine', referring to the hollow body cavity common to these two phyla. They have very simple tissue organization, with only two layers of cells along with a middle undifferentiated layer called mesoglea . (ectoderm and endoderm), and radial symmetry. Some examples are corals, which are typically colonial, and hydrae, jellyfish, and sea anemones, Aurelia which are solitary.And pennatula , Portugese man of war , gorgonia and physalia . Coelenterata lack a specialized circulatory system relying instead on diffusion across the tissue layers.
