Daniil Sergeyevich Medvedev (Russian: Даниил Сергеевич Медведев, IPA: [dənʲɪˈiɫ sʲɪrˈɡʲe(j)ɪvʲɪtɕ mʲɪdˈvʲedʲɪf]; born 11 February 1996) is a Russian professional tennis player. He has been ranked as high as world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), and is the current world No. 4. Medvedev has won 20 ATP Tour singles titles, including the 2021 US Open and 2020 ATP Finals. Medvedev defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final to deny him the Grand Slam. In the latter, he became the only player to defeat the top three ranked players in the world en route to the year-end championship title. He has also won six Masters titles and contested six major finals. His six Masters titles all came in different venues, making him only the sixth player to win Masters titles at six different venues. Medvedev made his ATP Tour main draw debut at the doubles event of the 2015 Kremlin Cup. In 2017, he participated in a singles major for the first time at Wimbledon, where he defeated world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka. In 2018, Medvedev won his first ATP Tour singles titles, and achieved a breakthrough in 2019, making his top 10 debut after Wimbledon and reaching six consecutive tournament finals, including at the US Open. He went on to win the ATP Finals in 2020 and contest two major finals in 2021, winning at the US Open. Shortly after reaching another Australian Open final in 2022, Medvedev became the first man outside of the Big Four to hold the world No. 1 ranking since Andy Roddick in 2004, the third Russian man following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000, and the 27th man overall. He then struggled with form and eventually dropped out of the top 10 in rankings, but returned to form in early 2023 and has since reached two more major finals and returned to world No. 3.
