A sybirak (Polish: [sɨˈbirak], plural: sybiracy) is a person resettled to Siberia. Like its Russian counterpart sibiryák the word can refer to any dweller of Siberia, but it more specifically refers to Poles imprisoned or exiled to Siberia[need quotation to verify] or even to those sent to the Russian Arctic or to Kazakhstan in the 1940s.
