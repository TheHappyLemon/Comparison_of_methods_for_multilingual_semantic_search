Władysław Albert Anders (11 August 1892 – 12 May 1970) was a general in the Polish Army and later in life a politician and prominent member of the Polish government-in-exile in London. Born in Krośniewice-Błonie, then part of the Russian Empire, he served in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and later joined the Polish Land Forces after Poland regained its independence in 1918. During World War II, Anders was captured by Soviet forces and imprisoned, but he was later released to form a Polish Army to fight against the Germans alongside the Red Army. He led the Polish II Corps throughout the Italian Campaign, including the capture of Monte Cassino. After the war, Anders was deprived of his citizenship and military rank by the Soviet-installed communist government of Poland. He remained in Britain, working for the Polish Government in Exile and various charities. In 1989, after the collapse of communist rule in Poland, his citizenship and military rank were posthumously reinstated.
