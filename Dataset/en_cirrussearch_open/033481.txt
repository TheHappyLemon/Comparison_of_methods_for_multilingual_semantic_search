Ryo Miyaichi (宮市 亮, Miyaichi Ryō, born 14 December 1992) is a Japanese professional footballer who plays as a winger for Yokohama F. Marinos in the J1 League and the Japan national team. Miyaichi began his professional career at Arsenal after a successful trial in 2010. However, without a British work permit, he was loaned out to Eredivisie side Feyenoord where he made his professional debut in 2011 at age 17. In 2012, Miyaichi spent loan periods at fellow Premier League clubs, Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic, helping win the FA Cup with the latter in 2013. After a long period ruled out with injury, Miyaichi returned to the Eredivisie, signing on loan to FC Twente in 2014. In June 2015, Miyaichi transferred to 2. Bundesliga side FC St. Pauli. In July 2021, Miyaichi returned to Japan, signing for Yokohama F. Marinos. A full international for Japan, Miyaichi made his debut in 2012 against Azerbaijan and was part of the Japan side that won the East Asian Football Championship in 2022. Japan's former manager Alberto Zaccheroni has said that "Miyaichi's strengths are on the flanks and creating space going forward." Once regarded as one of the best youth prospects in world football, Miyaichi's career has been plagued with injuries, missing over 150 senior matches in his career.
