The ending song Home Sweet Home is performed by Yuki Isoya. The English adaptation replaced the song with Jeremy Sweet's "Never Give Up", due to licensing restrictions. In the film, Naruto Uzumaki and his ninja team work on a bodyguard mission to protect Princess Yukie Fujikaze, who is posing as a film actress. An original video animation, Konoha Annual Sports Festival (木ノ葉運動会 Konoha Undōkai), was included with the Japanese release of the film. The film grossed US$11.1 million in the box offices and received generally positive reviews from critics for its focus on its animation and well-executed action sequences despite the character Yukie Fujikaze often being seen as the least interesting character presented.
