Kamila Valeryevna Valieva (Russian: Камила Валерьевна Валиева; born 26 April 2006) is a Russian figure skater. She is the 2021 Rostelecom Cup champion, the 2021 Skate Canada champion and a three-time Russian national medalist (silver in 2021 and 2023, bronze in 2024). During the 2022 Winter Olympics, a sample that Valieva had submitted for a drug test in December tested positive for trimetazidine. On 29 January 2024, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in Valieva's doping case involving the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA). The International Skating Union (ISU) and World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) imposed a four year ban on Valieva backdated to 25 December 2021, and disqualified her of all competitive results from that date, including the first place finishes at the 2022 European Figure Skating Championships and the 2022 Olympic team event. Valieva is the current world record holder for the women's short program, free skating, and total scores. She has set seven world records during her career. She is the first female skater to break the 250-, 260- and 270-point thresholds in the total score (all within one season), and the first to break the 170- and 180-point thresholds in the free skate. She is the second woman to land the quadruple toe loop after training partner and teammate Alexandra Trusova, the fourth woman to land a quadruple jump of any kind, the 16th woman to land a triple Axel, and the third woman to land a triple Axel and quadruple jump in the same program after Alysa Liu and training partner and teammate Sofia Akateva.
