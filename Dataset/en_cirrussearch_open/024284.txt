The 2014 French Open was a tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts. It was the 118th edition of the French Open and the second Grand Slam event of the year. It took place at the Stade Roland Garros from 25 May to 8 June. It consisted of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles play. Junior and wheelchair players also took part in singles and doubles events. Rafael Nadal was the four-time defending champion in the men's singles and defeated Novak Djokovic in the men's singles final to win his 9th French Open title and his 14th Grand Slam title. The victory made Nadal the first tennis player to have won 5 consecutive French Open titles, in addition to becoming the only man with at least one Grand Slam title in 10 consecutive years. Serena Williams was the defending women's singles champion. Williams failed to defend her title, losing to Garbiñe Muguruza in the second round. Maria Sharapova won the women's singles, defeating Simona Halep to win her second French Open title and her 5th Grand Slam title. This was first time that both singles winners of the Australian Open (Li Na and Stanislas Wawrinka) lost in the first round of the French Open. Also, for the first time at any Grand Slam event in the Open era, the top three women's seeds (Williams, Li, and Agnieszka Radwańska) all failed to reach the fourth round.
