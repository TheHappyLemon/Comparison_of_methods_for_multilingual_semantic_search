The Somme (UK: /sɒm/ SOM, US: /sʌm/ SUM, French: [sɔm] ) is a river in Picardy, northern France. The river is 245 km (152 mi) in length, from its source in the high ground of the former Arrouaise Forest [fr] at Fonsomme near Saint-Quentin, to the Bay of the Somme, in the English Channel. It lies in the geological syncline which also forms the Solent. This gives it a fairly constant and gentle gradient where several fluvial terraces have been identified.
