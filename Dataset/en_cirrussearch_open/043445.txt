Lampetra is a genus of lampreys in the family Petromyzontidae. Phylogenetic studies indicate that this genus as presently defined is polyphyletic, with species of this genus from western North America forming a clade that forms the sister group to Lethenteron, Eudontomyzon, and Lampetra sensu stricto (eastern North American and European species).
