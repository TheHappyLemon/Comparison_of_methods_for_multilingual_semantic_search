Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics was an event held in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. It was the debut appearance of karate at the Summer Olympics. Karate was one of four new sports added to the Olympic program specifically for 2020, rather than as a permanent sport. The karate competitions at the 2020 Olympics featured eight events. Two karate disciplines were featured: kumite was the sparring discipline and had three weight classes each for men and women; kata was the solo form discipline, and had one event each for men and women. Competitors chose the kata to demonstrate from 102 kata that were recognized by the World Karate Federation. Competitors were not allowed to demonstrate the same kata twice during the tournament. Each event had 10 competitors. The three weight classes in Olympic competition for kumite were in contrast to the five normally used by the World Karate Federation (WKF). The two lightest (-60 kg and -67 kg for men, -50 kg and -55 kg for women) were combined into the Olympic categories of -67 kg for men and -55 kg for women. The middle categories (-75 kg men, -61 kg women) were unchanged, while the two heaviest categories (-84 kg and +84 kg for men, -68 kg and +68 kg for women) were combined into +75 kg for men and +61 kg for women.
