The Svislach (Belarusian: Свіслач, romanized: Śvislač, pronounced [ˈsʲvʲisɫatʂ] ) or Svisloch (Russian: Свислочь) is a river in Belarus. A right-bank tributary of the river Berezina, the Svislach is 327 kilometres (203 mi) long, and has a drainage basin of 5,160 square kilometres (1,990 sq mi). Its name is derived from the root -visl- 'flowing,' of Indo-European origin (compare Vistula). The Svislach flows through Minsk, the capital of Belarus.
