Simeon Bekbulatovich (Russian: Симеон Бекбулатович; born Sain-Bulat; Russian: Саин-Булат; died 15 January [O.S. 5 January] 1616) was a Russian statesman of Tatar origin who briefly served as the figurehead ruler of Russia from 1575 to 1576. He was a descendant of Genghis Khan. He was born into a Muslim family and served as the khan of the Khanate of Qasim before converting to Christianity and becoming an aide to Ivan IV of Russia. He participated in the Livonian War as a commander of the main regiment (bol'shoi polk) of the Russian army. In 1575, Ivan made Simeon the grand prince of all Russia, though Ivan remained the de facto ruler and returned to his throne a year later. Subsequently, Simeon became the grand prince of Tver and Torzhok (1576–1585). He went blind (or was blinded) in 1595 and was allegedly tonsured as a Christian monk under the monastic name Stefan in 1606.
