The Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (Serbo-Croatian: Autonomna Pokrajina Zapadna Bosna; APZB), or Western Bosnia, was a small unrecognized proto-state that existed in the northwest of Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1993 and 1995. It consisted mainly of the town of Velika Kladuša, its capital, as well as a few nearby villages and fields. It was proclaimed as a result of secessionist politics by Fikret Abdić against the central government of Alija Izetbegović during the Bosnian War. For a short time in 1995, it was known as the Republic of Western Bosnia (Serbo-Croatian: Republika Zapadna Bosna; RZB).
