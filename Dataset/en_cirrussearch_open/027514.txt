Alofi is the capital of the island nation of Niue. With a population of 610 in 2022, Alofi has the distinction of being the second-smallest capital city of a sovereign state by population (after Ngerulmud, capital of Palau). It consists of two villages: Alofi North and Alofi South. They collectively serve as the capital, but of the two, Alofi South hosts more government buildings, as many were moved to the southern part after Cyclone Heta.
