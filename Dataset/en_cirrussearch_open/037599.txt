Tennis competitions at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing were held from August 10 to August 17 at the Olympic Green Tennis Centre. The DecoTurf surface rendered the event a hardcourt tournament. The women's singles event proved notable for being one of only two Olympiads — and the first since 1908 — in which all tennis medalists were from the same country – with Russian women sweeping the medals. The men's singles featured the first time an Olympic tennis player had medaled in consecutive Olympiads since the 1920 Games, while the men's doubles gave Switzerland its first medal in the event. The doubles also returned Switzerland and the United States to the medals stand for the first time since the 1988 re-introduction of the sport.
