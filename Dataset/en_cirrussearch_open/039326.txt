Lumbricus terrestris is a large, reddish worm species thought to be native to Western Europe, now widely distributed around the world (along with several other lumbricids). In some areas where it is an introduced species, some people consider it to be a significant pest for out-competing native worms. Through much of Europe, it is the largest naturally occurring species of earthworm, typically reaching 20 to 25Â cm in length when extended.
