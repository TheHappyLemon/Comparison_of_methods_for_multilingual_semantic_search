Georgia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Georgian National Olympic Committee (GNOC) sent the nation's smallest delegation to the Games since the post-Soviet era. A total of 32 athletes, 26 men and 6 women, competed in 10 different sports. The Georgian team featured four bronze medalists from the previous games: weightlifter Giorgi Asanidze, and wrestlers Akaki Chachua, Eldar Kurtanidze, and Mukhran Vakhtangadze. Among these medalists, Asanidze managed to beat his opponents and overhaul the host nation's defending champion Pyrros Dimas for the gold in the men's 85 kg class. Other notable athletes included pistol shooter and 1988 Olympic champion Nino Salukvadze, who participated in her fifth games under three different banners (the other two were Soviet Union and the Unified Team) as the oldest and most experienced member of the contingent, and judoka and world champion Zurab Zviadauri, who was appointed by GNOC to be the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Georgia left Athens with a total of four medals (two golds and two silver). These medals were officially awarded to Asanidze, Zviadauri, lightweight judoka Nestor Khergiani, and Greco-Roman wrestler Ramaz Nozadze.
