"Rockefeller Street" is a song by Estonian singer and actress Getter Jaani. It was released on 24 January 2011 by Moonwalk Records as the lead single for Jaani's debut studio album, Rockefeller Street. Written by Sven Lõhmus, "Rockefeller Street" was the Estonian entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011, held in Düsseldorf, where it placed 24th, one away from last place in the grand final. While the critical response to the song was positive, the Eurovision performance was negatively received. "Rockefeller Street" drew commercial success, peaking at number three in Estonia. Years after the song was performed at Eurovision, an unofficial nightcore version of the song became an Internet meme, leading to an increase in streams of the song and Jaani releasing an official nightcore version of the song.
