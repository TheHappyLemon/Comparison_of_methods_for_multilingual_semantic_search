¡Tré! (stylized in all caps) is the eleventh studio album by the American rock band Green Day. It is the third and final installment in the ¡Uno! ¡Dos! ¡Tré! trilogy, a series of studio albums that were released from September to December 2012. Green Day started recording material for the album on February 14, 2012, and finished on June 26, 2012. ¡Tré! follows the power pop style of ¡Uno!, and the garage rock feel of ¡Dos!. The album's title (making a pun on tres, which should follow the previous two titles) is a nod to the band's drummer Tré Cool, who turned 40 years old two days after the release. Cool is also featured on the album's cover. It is the band's last album with touring guitarist Jason White joining the band in the studio as a session member. ¡Tré! was released on December 7, 2012, in Australia, December 10 in the UK and December 11 in the US, through Reprise Records. Producing first week sales of 58,000 copies, a low for the band, the album received generally positive reviews from critics.
