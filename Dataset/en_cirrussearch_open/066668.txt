The Supercopa de España (Catalan: Supercopa de Espanya), also known as the Spanish Super Cup, is a super cup tournament in Spanish football. Founded in 1982 as a two-team competition, the current version has been contested since 2019–20 by four teams: the winners and runners-up of the Copa del Rey and La Liga. Until 1995, a team that won both the league and cup automatically got the trophy. But, from 1996 to 2019, if a team won both, they had to play the second-place team from the cup for the Supercopa. Since its inception, thirteen teams have participated in the tournament, but only ten have been crowned champions. Real Madrid is the current champion after defeating Barcelona in the 2024 edition held in Riyadh. Barcelona remains the most successful team with fourteen titles, followed by Real Madrid with thirteen. Athletic Club and Deportivo La Coruña each have three titles, with Deportivo La Coruña notably winning every edition they have participated in. Lionel Messi is the competition's all-time top scorer and the most decorated player, with eight titles.
