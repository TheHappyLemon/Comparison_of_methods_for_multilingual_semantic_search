The Boerentoren (English: "Farmers' Tower"; officially the KBC Tower, originally the Torengebouw van Antwerpen) is a historic high-rise building in Antwerp, Belgium. Constructed between 1929 and 1932 and originally 87.5 m (287 ft) high, it remained the tallest building and the second-tallest structure in the city (after the Gothic Cathedral of Our Lady) until 2019, when the Antwerp Tower surpassed it with a height of 100.7 m (330 ft). At the time of construction, it was the second tallest building in Europe by roof height (after the Telefónica Building in Madrid). Designed in Art Deco style by Jan Vanhoenacker, Émile Van Averbeke and Jos Smolderen, the Boerentoren was one of Europe's very first tall buildings. It remained the tallest in Belgium until 1960, and is currently ranked 21st tallest in the country. In 1954, the tower was extended with an antenna, reaching a total height of 112.5 m (369 ft). In 1976, the tower's roof was raised by 8.3 m (27 ft), and the current roof height is 95.8 m (314 ft).
