The Last House on the Left is a 1972 horror film written and directed by Wes Craven in his directorial debut, and produced by Sean S. Cunningham. The film stars Sandra Peabody, Lucy Grantham, David Hess, Fred J. Lincoln, Jeramie Rain, and Marc Sheffler. Additionally, Martin Kove appears in a supporting role. The plot follows Mari Collingwood (Peabody), a teenager who is abducted, raped, and tortured by a family of violent fugitives led by Krug Stillo (Hess) on her seventeenth birthday. When her parents discover what happened to her, they seek vengeance against the family, who have taken shelter at their home. Craven based it on the 1960 Swedish film The Virgin Spring, directed by Ingmar Bergman, which in turn is an adaptation of the Swedish ballad "Töres döttrar i Wänge". Cunningham produced the film for $90,000 and used a cast of relatively unknown actors. Distributor Hallmark Releasing, in partnership with American International Pictures, gave him and Craven funding after the box office success of Cunningham's Together (1971). Craven cut the film numerous times for the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) to rate it R. Internationally, the United Kingdom refused to certify the film for release, and while briefly released on home video in the 1980s, the "video nasty" scare led to the banning of the film until 2002. The Last House on the Left was released in the United States on August 30, 1972. While the film initially received a polarizing reception from critics, it was highly profitable, grossing over $3 million at the domestic box office. Like the exploitation films Night of the Living Dead (1968) and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), the film has received critical reevaluation years after release, with particular praise towards the narrative and performances of Peabody and Hess. It has since achieved a cult following and received a nomination for AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills in 2001. The film was remade in 2009.
