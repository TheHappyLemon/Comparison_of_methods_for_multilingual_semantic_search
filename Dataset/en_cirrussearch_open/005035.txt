The 2010 NBA All-Star Game was an exhibition basketball game that was played on February 14, 2010, during the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2009–10 season. It was the 59th edition of the NBA All-Star Game, and was played at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The Eastern Conference defeated the Western Conference, 141–139. The East's Dwyane Wade, who recorded 28 points on 75% shooting, 11 assists, 6 rebounds and 5 steals, was named as the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player. This was the second time that the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area had hosted the All-Star Game; the area had previously hosted the event in 1986. Dallas was awarded the 2010 All-Star Game in an announcement by commissioner David Stern on October 30, 2008. The All-Star Weekend began on Friday, February 12, 2010, with the Celebrity Game and the Rookie Challenge, a game between the league's best rookies and second-year players. On Saturday, the event continued with the All-Star Saturday Night, which featured the Shooting Stars Competition, Skills Challenge, Three-Point Shootout, Slam Dunk Contest and H–O–R–S–E Competition. The D-League All-Star Game and the second D-League Dream Factory Friday Night, the latter of which was modeled after the NBA All-Star Saturday Night, also took place during the All-Star Weekend. The D-League Dream Factory Friday Night was held on Friday and the D-League All-Star Game was held on Saturday. In the Rookie Challenge, the Rookies defeated the Sophomores for the first time since 2002, with Rookies' Tyreke Evans named as the game MVP. In the All-Star Saturday Night events, Nate Robinson won his third Slam Dunk Contest while Paul Pierce and Steve Nash won the Three-Point Shootout and Skills Challenge respectively. Team Texas, the home team, won the Shootings Stars Competition. Kevin Durant repeated as champion in the H–O–R–S–E Competition. The announced attendance for the All-Star Game was 108,713, the all-time attendance record for the sport. The previous verified record for attendance at a basketball game was 78,129, set in a December 13, 2003 game between Kentucky and Michigan State at Ford Field in Detroit. The final of the 1968 European Cup Winners' Cup between AEK Athens and Slavia Prague at Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens is believed to have had an attendance of 120,000 but that total was not verified at the time. The previous record attendance for an NBA All-Star Game was 44,735, set at the Houston Astrodome for the 1989 All-Star Game. This event also broke the record for the single largest attendance for an indoor event, previously held by WrestleMania III in 1987. This marked the first All-Star game where neither team wore a white uniform. The East wore blue uniforms with silver trim, while the West wore red uniforms with gold trim.
