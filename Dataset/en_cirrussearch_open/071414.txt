The Severians, also Severyans, Siverians, or Siverianians (Belarusian: Севяране; Bulgarian: Севери; Russian: Северяне; Ukrainian: Сiверяни, romanized: Siveriany) were a tribe or tribal confederation of early East Slavs occupying areas to the east of the middle Dnieper River and southeast of the Danube River. They are mentioned by the Bavarian Geographer (9th century), Emperor Constantine VII (956–959), the Khazar ruler Joseph (c. 955), and in the Primary Chronicle (1113).
