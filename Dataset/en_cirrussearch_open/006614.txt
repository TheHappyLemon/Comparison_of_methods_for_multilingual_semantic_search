The president of the Republic of Azerbaijan is the head of state of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The Constitution states that the president is the embodiment of executive power, commander-in-chief, "representative of Azerbaijan in home and foreign policies", and "shall have the right of immunity [from prosecution]." The president rules through his executive office, the Presidential Administration, consisting of a group of secretaries and departmental ministers. Additionally, there is a Cabinet of Ministers regarding economic and social policy and a Security Council regarding foreign, military, and judicial matters. The primary workplace is the presidential building (also known as the presidential apparatus) on Istiglaliyyat Street in Baku. Ilham Aliyev, son of the former president, Heydar, was elected the 4th and current president on 31 October 2003 after his father's resignation due to his deteriorating health and eventually died several months later.
