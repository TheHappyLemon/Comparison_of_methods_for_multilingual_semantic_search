The Latvia men's national volleyball team (Latvian: Latvijas vīriešu volejbola izlase) represents Latvia in international men's volleyball competitions and friendly matches. It is governed by the Latvian Volleyball Federation and takes part in international volleyball competitions. The team was formed shortly after regaining full independence in 1991. The biggest achievement of the national team until 2020 was the qualification for the group stage of the 1995 Men's European Volleyball Championship in Greece. In September 2020, the team qualified for the 2021 Men's European Volleyball Championship after beating Cyprus 3-0 and claiming the top spot in Qualifying Pool D, which came after a 26-year-long absence from the European championships.
