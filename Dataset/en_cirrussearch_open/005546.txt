Callipogon relictus is a species of longhorn beetle which is mostly found in Korea, but also in China and southern part of Russian Far East. It inhabits mixed and deciduous forests. The population of Callipogon relictus is decreasing due to deforestation and uncontrolled collection, and therefore the species are listed in the Russian Red Book (category II). The larvae of Callipogon relictus develop in the drying deciduous trees. The process takes 4 to 6 years, and the same tree can be populated by larvae several times a year. Larvae bring along spores of the fungus Pleurotus citrinopileatus, that contributes to degradation of the tree. With the length reaching up to 110 mm (4.3 in), Callipogon relictus is the largest beetle of Russia. Larvae of different longhorn beetles can coexist in the same tree, such as Callipogon relictus, Rosalia coelestis, Leptura thoracica, Rhabdoclytus acutivittis, Anoplodera cyanea and several other species.
