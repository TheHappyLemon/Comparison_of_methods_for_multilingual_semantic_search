Newey has worked in both Formula One and IndyCar racing as a race engineer, aerodynamicist, designer, and technical director; he has enjoyed success in both categories. Newey is regarded by many to be one of the greatest engineers in Formula One history; his designs have won numerous titles and more than 200 Grands Prix. Newey is also one of the most successful designers, winning twelve Constructors' Championships with three different Formula One teams, and with seven different drivers winning thirteen Drivers' Championships driving Newey's designs. After designing championship-winning Formula One cars for Williams F1 and McLaren, Newey moved to Red Bull Racing in 2006, his cars winning the Formula One drivers' and constructors' championships consecutively from 2010 to 2013, the drivers' championship in 2021, and both championships in 2022 and 2023. The Newey-designed Red Bull Racing RB19 is the most dominant Formula One car in history, winning 21 out of the 22 races (95.45%) it competed in. Newey's designs also won the 1985 and 1986 CART titles.
