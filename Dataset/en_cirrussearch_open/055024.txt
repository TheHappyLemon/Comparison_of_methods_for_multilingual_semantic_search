Djalma Pereira Dias dos Santos known simply as Djalma Santos (Brazilian Portuguese: [diˈʒawmɐ ˈsɐ̃tus]; also spelled Dejalma Santos), (27 February 1929 – 23 July 2013) was a Brazilian footballer who starred for the Brazil national team in four World Cups and winning the 1958 and 1962 editions. Santos is considered to be one of the greatest right-backs of all time. While primarily known for his defensive skills, he often ventured upfield and displayed some impressive technical and attacking skills. Along with Franz Beckenbauer and Philipp Lahm, he is one of only three players to be included into three FIFA World Cup All Star teams (in 1954, 1958 and 1962). He was unrelated to his frequent defensive partner Nilton Santos. He was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He is also one of the few footballers to have made over 1,000 professional appearances in his career. Djalma Santos made history in the three big clubs he played for. Djalma was an idol at Palmeiras, where he played 498 games for nine years and won several titles, at Portuguesa, where he emerged in professional football and played 510 games, and at Atlético Paranaense, where he ended his career. Known as an exemplary player, he was never sent-off from the field.
