Exodus: Gods and Kings is a 2014 biblical epic film directed and produced by Ridley Scott, and written by Adam Cooper, Bill Collage, Jeffrey Caine, and Steven Zaillian. The film stars Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton, John Turturro, Aaron Paul, Ben Mendelsohn, Sigourney Weaver, and Ben Kingsley. It is inspired by the biblical episode of the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt led by Moses and related in the Book of Exodus. Development on the film was first announced by Scott in June 2012. Filming occurred primarily in Spain beginning in October 2013, with additional filming at Pinewood Studios in England. The film was released on December 12, 2014 by 20th Century Fox, to mixed reviews. Critics praised the visual effects and cast performances, but criticized its pacing, screenplay, lack of emotional heft, and inaccuracy to the source material. The film also received accusations of whitewashing for its primarily Caucasian cast, and was banned in Egypt and in the United Arab Emirates for "historical inaccuracies". It was considered a financial disappointment, earning $268 million worldwide on a budget of $140â€“200 million.
