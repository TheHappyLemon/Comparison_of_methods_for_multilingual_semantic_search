Since the Premier League's formation at the beginning of the 1992–93 season, a total of 34 players have scored 100 or more goals in the competition; these players are collectively referred to as the Premier League 100 Club. During the 1995–96 season, Alan Shearer became the first player to score 100 Premier League goals, and holds the record for the fewest games taken to reach the figure, doing so in 124 appearances. Additionally, he also holds the record for most goals scored in the Premier League with 260. Harry Kane is the second-fastest to 100 goals, doing so in 141 games. At 23 years and 133 days, Michael Owen was the youngest player to reach the 100 goal milestone. Dwight Yorke was the first non-English player to score 100 goals in the Premier League, doing so on 25 November 2000. Didier Drogba was the first African player to reach the hundred goal milestone on 10 March 2012 and Sergio Agüero was the first South American to reach a century of goals on 19 April 2016. On 8 April 2023, Son Heung-min became the most recent player to reach 100 goals, as well as the first Asian player. Six of the 34 players accomplished the feat without scoring a penalty – Sadio Mané, Peter Crouch, Emile Heskey, Les Ferdinand, Andy Cole, and Ryan Giggs. Emmanuel Adebayor departed English football in 2016 with 97 goals. Of the still active players in the Premier League, Callum Wilson is closest to joining the 100 Club; the Newcastle United striker has hit 86 goals so far, with 41 of them coming for Bournemouth. Marcus Rashford is not far behind with 82 goals, all for Manchester United.
