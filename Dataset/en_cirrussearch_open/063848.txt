Lolium giganteum, giant fescue, is a woodland grass that grows on neutral to base-rich soils, often near streams or other damp places. It is native to Europe and much of Asia and has been introduced to parts of North America. Most publications have used the names Festuca gigantea or, more recently, Schedonorus giganteus for this species, but DNA studies appear to have settled a long debate that it should be included within the genus Lolium instead.
