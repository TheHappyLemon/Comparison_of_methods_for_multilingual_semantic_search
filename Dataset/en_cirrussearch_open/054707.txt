The Asian Beach Games, also known as ABG, is a multi-sport event held every four years among athletes from all over Asia. The Games have been organized by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA). The Games are described as the second or third largest Asian multi-sport event, after the Asian Games. Its popularity is increasing due to the low cost of temporary venues, with beaches and oceans already available, while spectators and tourists are also already available in sand and sea tourist areas. In its history, six countries have hosted the Asian Beach Games. Forty-five nations have participated in the Games. The most recent Games were held in Danang, Vietnam from 24 September to 3 October 2016, while the next games will be held in 2023 in Sanya, China; the 2023 Games will be the first to break away from the 2-year cycle. Since the cancellation of the 2023 edition, this event has been scrapped and discontinued altogether.
