The Lezginka (Lezgian: Лезги кьуьл; Russian: Лезгинка) is the collective name originally given by Russians to all North Caucasian dances united by fast 6 8 rhythm. It can be solo male or pair dance. The melody is clear and dynamic, the pace is fast. The dance is commonly misattributed only to the Lezgin people. However, until the end of 19th century, Russians used name "Lezgin" as the common name for all highlanders of Dagestan.[circular reference], as well as Chechnya, Ingushetia and Northern Azerbaijan. According to Encyclopædia Britannica: Lezginka, also spelled Lezghinka, folk dance originating among the Lezgin people of the North Caucasus. It is a male solo dance (often with a sword) and also a couple dance. The man, imitating the eagle, falls to his knees, leaps up, and dances with concise steps and strong, sharp arm and body movements. When the dance is performed in pairs, couples do not touch; the woman dances quietly as she regards the man’s display.
