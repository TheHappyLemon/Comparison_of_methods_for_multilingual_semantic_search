Viðoy (Faroese pronunciation: [ˈviːjɔɪ], Danish: Viderø) is the northernmost island in the Faroe Islands, located east of Borðoy to which it is linked via a causeway. The name means wood island, despite the fact that no trees grow on the island; the name relates to the driftwood that floats in from Siberia and North America.
