The Indonesia national football team (Indonesian: Tim nasional sepak bola Indonesia) represents Indonesia in international football. They were the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup, particularly in the 1938 edition as the Dutch East Indies. The 6â€“0 loss to eventual finalists Hungary in the first round remains the nation's only appearance in the World Cup. Thus, Indonesia holds the World Cup records as the team with the fewest matches played (1) and one of the teams with the fewest goals scored (0). The team's only appearance at the Olympics was in 1956. Indonesia qualified for the AFC Asian Cup on five occasions, and advanced to the knockout stage for the first time in the 2023 edition, exiting in the round of 16. Indonesia achieved the bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games in Tokyo. The team has reached the AFF Championship finals ties on six occasions but has never become champions. They share a regional rivalry with ASEAN teams, notably the rivalry against Malaysia, primarily due to political tensions.
