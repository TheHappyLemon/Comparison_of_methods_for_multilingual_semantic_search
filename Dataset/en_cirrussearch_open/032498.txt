The Queen of Sheba (Hebrew: מַלְכַּת שְׁבָא‎, romanized: Malkaṯ Səḇāʾ; Arabic: ملكة سبأ, romanized: Malikat Sabaʾ; Ge'ez: ንግሥተ ሳባ, romanized: Nəgśətä Saba) is a figure first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. In the original story, she brings a caravan of valuable gifts for the Israelite King Solomon. This account has undergone extensive Jewish, Islamic, Yemenite and Ethiopian elaborations, and it has become the subject of one of the most widespread and fertile cycles of legends in Asia and Africa. Modern historians identify Sheba with the South Arabian kingdom of Saba in present-day Yemen and Ethiopia. The queen's existence is disputed among historians.
