Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a standard for data transmission in a local area network. It uses optical fiber as its standard underlying physical medium, although it was also later specified to use copper cable, in which case it may be called CDDI (Copper Distributed Data Interface), standardized as TP-PMD (Twisted-Pair Physical Medium-Dependent), also referred to as TP-DDI (Twisted-Pair Distributed Data Interface). FDDI was effectively made obsolete in local networks by Fast Ethernet which offered the same 100Â Mbit/s speeds, but at a much lower cost and, from 1998 on, by Gigabit Ethernet due to its speed, even lower cost, and ubiquity.
