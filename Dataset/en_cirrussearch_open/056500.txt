The University of Dubrovnik (Croatian: Sveučilište u Dubrovniku, Latin: Universitas Studiorum Ragusina) is a public university located in Dubrovnik, Croatia. It has its roots in various successive institutions dedicated to the teaching of maritime engineering and naval architecture. In 1996, in recognition of the city's maritime traditions, the Polytechnic was established and was later given full university status in 2003. The university has since diversified its courses but the maritime sciences remains its traditional strength.
