The Danco Coast (64°42′S 62°0′W﻿ / ﻿64.700°S 62.000°W﻿ / -64.700; -62.000) is the portion of the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula between Cape Sterneck and Cape Renard. This coast was explored in January and February 1898 by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition under Adrien de Gerlache, who named it for Lieutenant Emile Danco who died on the expedition. The coast is bordered by the Aguirre Passage which separates it from Lemaire Island.
