Solyanka (Russian: соля́нка, initially селя́нка; [sɐˈlʲankə]) is a thick and sour soup of Russian origin that is common in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Baltic states and other post-Soviet states and certain parts of the former Eastern Bloc. It was one of the most reliably available dishes in the former East Germany (German: Soljanka).
