Moksha (мокшень кяль, mokšəń käĺ, pronounced ['mɔkʃənʲ kʲælʲ]) is a Mordvinic language of the Uralic family, with around 130,000 native speakers in 2010. Moksha is the majority language in the western part of Mordovia. Its closest relative is the Erzya language, with which it is not mutually intelligible. Moksha is also possibly closely related to the extinct Meshcherian and Muromian languages.
