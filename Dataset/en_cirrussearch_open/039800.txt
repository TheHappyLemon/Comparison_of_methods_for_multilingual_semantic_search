César Azpilicueta Tanco (Spanish pronunciation: [aθpiliˈkweta], born 28 August 1989) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a defender for La Liga club Atlético Madrid and the Spain national team. He is best remembered for his time with English club Chelsea, with whom he spent over a decade and captained. Known for his workrate, leadership and defensive prowess, he is regarded as one of Chelsea's best defenders of the modern era and one of the best Premier League defenders of the 2010s. A youth product of Osasuna, Azpilicueta spent three seasons in La Liga before switching to Marseille, winning four major honours with the French club. In the summer of 2012 he moved to Chelsea, winning the Europa League in his first season and a domestic double two years later. He made over 500 appearances for the club and was sixth on their list of all-time appearances when he departed in 2023, with no other non-English person having played more times for them. Described as a Stamford Bridge 'legend', he captained Chelsea to win the Europa League in 2019, the Champions League in 2021, and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2021. Azpilicueta earned 55 caps for Spain at youth level in all age groups, and represented the under-21s in two European Championships, winning the 2011 edition. He made his first appearance with the full side in 2013 and was selected for three World Cups as well as Euro 2016 and UEFA Euro 2020.
