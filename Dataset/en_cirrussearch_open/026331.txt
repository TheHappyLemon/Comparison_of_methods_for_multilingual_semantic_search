Khafre (/ˈkæfreɪ, ˈkɑːfreɪ/ KA(H)F-ray) or Khafra (Ancient Egyptian: ḫꜥ.f-rꜥ, lit. 'He appears as Ra'), also known as Khephren or Chephren (/ˈkɛfrən/ KEF-rən; Ancient Greek: Χεφρῆν, romanized: Chephrên), was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom. He was the son of Khufu and the successor of Djedefre. According to the ancient historian Manetho, Khafre was followed by king Bikheris, but according to archaeological evidence he was instead followed by king Menkaure. Khafre was the builder who made the second largest pyramid at Giza. The view held by modern Egyptology at large continues to be that the Great Sphinx of Giza was built in approximately 2500 BC for Khafre. Not much is known about Khafre, except from the reports of Herodotus, writing 2,000 years after his life.
