Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage!, subtitled Brand New World from its 3rd anniversary, is a rhythm game developed by Colorful Palette, a studio of Craft Egg, who also was involved in development before it shifted to Colorful Palette, and published by Sega. The game is a spin-off from Sega's Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series, and features Crypton Future Media's Virtual Singers Hatsune Miku (初音ミク) (CV01), Megurine Luka (巡音ルカ) (CV03), Kagamine Rin and Len (鏡音リン・レン) (CV02), MEIKO (メイコ), and KAITO (カイト), alongside the cast of 20 original human characters that are split into five units, each with a unique theme. Set in the real world where Virtual Singers only exist as fiction, the characters come across another dimension called "SEKAI," where various "true feelings" are projected. The game was released for Android and iOS devices on September 30, 2020. It was developed with Unity, and uses the Piapro Studio NT engine for speech synthesis.
