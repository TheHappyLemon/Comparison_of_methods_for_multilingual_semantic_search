The raion was abolished and its territory was merged into Uzhhorod Raion on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Zakarpattia Oblast to six.

A Romanian community, known as volohi in Romanian, also inhabited this raion, more specifically in the area of the village of Poroshkovo.
