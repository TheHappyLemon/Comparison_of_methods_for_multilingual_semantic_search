Pabradė (pronunciation; Polish: Podbrodzie; Yiddish: פּאָדבראָדז Podbrodz) is a city in Lithuania, in Švenčionys district municipality, on Žeimena river, 38 km south-west of Švenčionys. Pabradė is a busy place as the Vilnius–Daugavpils railway is close to the city. It was quite a small settlement until the 19th century, when the Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway was built in 1862.
