Old Theatre of Vilnius (Lithuanian: Vilniaus senasis teatras), built in 1913 as Pohulanka Theatre and formerly known as Russian Drama Theatre of Lithuania (or Lithuanian Russian Dramatic Theatre) and other names, is a theatre in the Old Town of Vilnius. It is the only professional theatre in Lithuania that stages performances in Russian. The traditions of Russian theatre in Vilnius date back to the Russian Drama Theatre of 1864 established by Alexandrinsky Theatre actor Pavel Vasilyev. The name of the theatre was changed by a decision of the Lithuanian Ministry of Culture in September 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine of that year.
