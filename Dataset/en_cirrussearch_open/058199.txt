Thirty-one athletes from four nations competed. Roger de Barbarin took gold, René Guyot silver, and Justinien de Clary bronze. There was a shoot-off between de Barbarin and Guyot (which the former won 13–12), which de Clary did not compete in despite having scored the same as the other two in the main round.
