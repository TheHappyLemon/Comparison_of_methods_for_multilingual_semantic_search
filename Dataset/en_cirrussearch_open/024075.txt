Kremenchuk (/ˌkrɛmənˈtʃuːk, ˌkrɪmɪnˈ-/; Ukrainian: Кременчук, IPA: [kremenˈtʃuk] , Russian: Кременчуг) is an industrial city in central Ukraine which stands on the banks of the Dnieper River. The city serves as the administrative center of Kremenchuk Raion within Poltava Oblast. Kremenchuk also hosts the administration of Kremenchuk urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Its population is approximately 215,271 (2022 estimate), ranking 31st in Ukraine. In 2001, the Ukrainian government included the city in the list of historical settlements. Although not as large as some other oblast centers, Kremenchuk has a large industrial center in Ukraine and Eastern Europe. A KrAZ truck plant, the Kremenchuk Oil Refinery of Ukrtatnafta, the Kriukiv Railway Car Building Works, and Kremenchuk Hydroelectric Power Plant, in nearby Svitlovodsk, are located in or near Kremenchuk. Highway M22 crosses the Dnieper over the dam of the power plant. Originally established on the left bank, Kremenchuk eventually incorporated the city of Kriukiv [uk] on the right bank. The Kriukiv Railway Car Building Works is one of the oldest railway-repair and rail-car-building factories in Eastern Europe, dating from 1869. Kremenchuk's Ukrtatnafta oil refinery is the largest in Ukraine and for a while was the only one operating since the beginning of the conflict with Russia that left refineries in the Donbas inactive. Because of Russian attacks during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the refinery was out of operation in 2022.
