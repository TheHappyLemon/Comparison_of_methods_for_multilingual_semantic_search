Alchevsk (Ukrainian: Алчéвськ; Russian: Алчéвск) is a city and the nominal administrative center of Alchevsk Raion in Luhansk Oblast, in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. It is located 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the administrative center of the oblast, Luhansk. Population: 106,062 (2022 estimate). Alchevsk is one of the largest industrial centers in the Donbas, and comprises a quarter of the entire oblast's production. Its economy depends on the companies of OJSC "Alchevsk Iron & Steel Works" (a trade blockade by Ukrainian activists during the war in Donbas has all but halted production of this plant in February 2017) and "Alchevsk Coke-Chemical Plant". The city was known as Voroshylovsk (Ukrainian: Ворошиловськ) from 1931 to 1961, and then Kommunarsk (Ukrainian: Комунарськ) until 1991. Alchevsk came under control of pro-Russian separatists in early 2014, and was incorporated into the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR / LNR). After declaring its annexation of the region in 2022, Russia has claimed the city.
