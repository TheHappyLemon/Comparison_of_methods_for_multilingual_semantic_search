Hornavan is a lake in northern Sweden. Located in Arjeplog Municipality in the province of Swedish Lapland, administratively known as Norrbotten County, it is the deepest lake in Sweden at 221 metres (725 ft). Being a high mountain lake downstream from the source of the Skellefte River, the deepest point of the lake basin is still located 204 metres (669 ft) above sea level. Due to the cold subarctic climate of the area, it always freezes over for several months of the year in spite of its depth.
