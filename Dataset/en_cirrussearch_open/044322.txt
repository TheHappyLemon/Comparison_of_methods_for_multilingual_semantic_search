Ferdinand is a 2017 American animated adventure comedy-drama film produced by Blue Sky Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Loosely based on Munro Leaf and Robert Lawson's 1936 children's book The Story of Ferdinand, the film was written by Robert L. Baird, Tim Federle, and Brad Copeland, and directed by Carlos Saldanha. The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes John Cena, Kate McKinnon, Bobby Cannavale, Peyton Manning, Anthony Anderson, David Tennant, Tim Nordquist, Lily Day, Juanes, Jerrod Carmichael, Miguel Ángel Silvestre, Raúl Esparza, Gina Rodriguez, Daveed Diggs, Gabriel Iglesias, Flula Borg, Boris Kodjoe, and Sally Phillips. The music for the film was composed by John Powell, making it his eighth and final collaboration with Blue Sky before it shut down on April 10, 2021. The story, written by Ron Burch, David Kidd, and Don Rhymer, follows a gentle pacifist bull named Ferdinand who refuses to participate in bullfighting but is forced back into the arena where his beliefs are challenged when he faces off against the world's greatest bullfighter. Ferdinand premiered on December 10, 2017 in Los Angeles, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 15, 2017 and received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics and audiences. It was originally a box office bomb at the North American box office, but fared better internationally, grossing $296 million worldwide against a production budget of $111 million. Ferdinand received a nomination for Best Animated Feature at the 90th Academy Awards (losing against Coco), as well as nominations at the 75th Golden Globe Awards for Best Animated Feature Film and Best Original Song ("Home"). It was also the last film by Blue Sky Studios to be nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe before the studio's closure in April 2021.
