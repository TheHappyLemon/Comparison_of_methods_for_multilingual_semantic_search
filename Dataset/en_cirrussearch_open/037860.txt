The national flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Persian: پرچم ایران), also known as the tricolor (Persian: پرچم سه‌رنگ ایران), is a tricolor featuring the Pan-Iranian colors comprising equal horizontal bands of green, white and red with the national emblem ("Allah") in red centred on the white band and the takbir written 11 times each in the Kufic script in white, at the bottom of the green and the top of the red band. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the present-day flag was adopted on 29 July 1980. Many Iranian exiles opposed to the Iranian government as well as Iranian mationalists use the Iranian monarchy tricolour flag with the Lion and Sun at the center,[page needed] or the tricolour without additional emblems.
