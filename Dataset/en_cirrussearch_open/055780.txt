The City Hall (Dutch: Stadhuis) of Antwerp, Belgium, stands on the western side of that city's Grote Markt (main square). Erected between 1561 and 1565, after designs made by Cornelis Floris de Vriendt and several other architects and artists, this Renaissance building incorporates both Flemish and Italian influences. The building is listed as one of the Belfries of Belgium and France, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
