Benzenehexol, also called hexahydroxybenzene, is an organic compound with formula C 6H 6O 6 or C 6(OH) 6. It is a six-fold phenol of benzene. The product is also called hexaphenol, but this name has been used also for other substances. Benzenehexol is a crystalline solid soluble in hot water, with a melting point above 310Â°. It can be prepared from inositol (cyclohexanehexol). Oxidation of benzenehexol yields tetrahydroxy-p-benzoquinone (THBQ), rhodizonic acid, and dodecahydroxycyclohexane. Conversely, benzenehexol can be obtained by reduction of sodium THBQ salt with SnCl2/HCl. Benzenehexol is a starting material for a class of discotic liquid crystals. Benzenehexol forms an adduct with 2,2'-bipyridine, with 1:2 molecular ratio.
