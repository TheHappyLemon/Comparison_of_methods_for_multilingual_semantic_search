Frédéric Fiebig (Latvian: Frederiks Fībigs; 1885–1953) was a Latvian-born painter who lived in France. He was influenced by both post-Impressionism and Cubism and is considered a member of the Expressionist movement. Fiebig was a great traveler, passionate about urban landscape and nature, where he drew his inspiration, until a series of family dramas forced him to settle in Alsace (East of France).
