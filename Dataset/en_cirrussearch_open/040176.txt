The Imola Circuit, officially called the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari (Italian for 'Enzo and Dino Ferrari International Circuit'), is a 4.909 km (3.050 mi) motor racing circuit. It is located in the town of Imola, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, 40-kilometre (25 mi) east of Bologna. It is one of the few major international circuits to run in an anti-clockwise direction. Initially used for motorcycle racing, the first race at Imola was held in 1953. The circuit is named after the founder of the Ferrari car company, Enzo Ferrari (1898–1988), and his son Alfredo "Dino" Ferrari (1932–1956). From 1953–1956 it was called the Autodromo di Imola and from 1957–1988 the Autodromo Dino Ferrari. The circuit has an FIA Grade One licence. Imola hosted non-championship Formula One races in the 1963 Imola Grand Prix and the 1979 Dino Ferrari Grand Prix. It was used for official championship races in the 1980 Italian Grand Prix and the San Marino Grand Prix every year from 1981 to 2006. Safety concerns with the circuit were raised throughout the 1980s and 1990s, particularly with the high speed Tamburello corner where numerous accidents occurred. This resulted in fatalities, including the death of Ayrton Senna in 1994. Chicanes were introduced at multiple points to reduce cornering speeds, which changed the nature of the course and caused problems with their high kerbs. Formula One stopped racing at Imola in 2007, leading the circuit owners to undertake major reconstruction work to the track and pit lane facilities. After the works were completed, a contract was signed for Formula One to return in to Imola from 2017, but legal disputes prevented this from occurring. It eventually returned in 2020, with the circuit hosting the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix from 2020–present. When Formula One visits Imola, it is considered the home circuit of the Scuderia Ferrari racing team, which is based in nearby Maranello.[dubious – discuss] The circuit has hosted many other motor racing series, including the Superbike World Championship, Motocross World Championship, World Touring Car Championship and European Le Mans Series. Several road bicycle races have also used the circuit, including stages of the Giro d'Italia and UCI Road World Championships.
