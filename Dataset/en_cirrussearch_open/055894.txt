Ras ben Sakka (Arabic for "Cape Ben Sakka"), the tip of Cape Angela in northern Tunisia, is the northernmost point of the African continent. It is located 15 km (9.3 mi) from Bizerte and 22 km (14 mi) to the northeast of Ichkeul Lake World Heritage Site. It is located just 950 m (3,120 ft) west of Cape Blanc (French: Cap Blanc, "White Cape"; Arabic: Ras al-Abyad)[citation needed], which is also often (mistakenly) described as the northern tip of Africa. Ras ben Sakka reaches about 30 m (98 ft) further north than the other. Monument Monument
