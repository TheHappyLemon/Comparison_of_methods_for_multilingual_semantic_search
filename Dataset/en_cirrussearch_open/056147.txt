Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa (lit. 'Greenland's Radio'; officially rendered into English as the Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation), also known by its abbreviation KNR, is Greenland's national public broadcasting organization. Based in the country's capital city, Nuuk, KNR is an independent state-owned corporation headed by a five-person board. Its activities are funded from a mixture of sources, mainly direct government funding but also limited on-air advertising. In 2012–13, all elements of KNR Radio and TV relocated to a new building in Nuuk. The broadcasts come from various sources, including Naalakkersuisut (the Greenland government), various associations, collaborations with private local broadcasters and broadcasts abroad, especially DR. KNR is an associate member of Nordvision, an association of state broadcasters in the Nordic countries. As of April 2022[update], a fifth of KNR's positions are vacant due to low salaries; the station has had to reduce its internet and radio reporting.
