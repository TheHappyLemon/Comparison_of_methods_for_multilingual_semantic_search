Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (/ˈkuːlɒm, -loʊm, kuːˈlɒm, -ˈloʊm/, KOO-lom, -⁠lohm, koo-LOM, -⁠LOHM; French: [kulɔ̃]; 14 June 1736 – 23 August 1806) was a French officer, engineer, and physicist. He is best known as the eponymous discoverer of what is now called Coulomb's law, the description of the electrostatic force of attraction and repulsion. He also did important work on friction. The SI unit of electric charge, the coulomb, was named in his honor in 1880.
