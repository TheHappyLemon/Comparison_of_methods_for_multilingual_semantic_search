Norwich have won the League Cup twice, in 1962 and 1985. The club's highest ever league finish came in the 1992–93 season when they finished third in the Premier League. Norwich have featured in the UEFA Cup once, in the 1993–94 season, where they were defeated in the third round, but en route became the first English club to defeat German side Bayern Munich at the Olympiastadion in Munich.
