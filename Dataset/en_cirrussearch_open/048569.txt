Ukraine competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's sixth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics in the post-Soviet era. Ukraine's medal tally was its lowest since independence, with only two gold and eleven total medals, a far cry from 9 gold and 23 total medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics and less than five gold and 19 medals overall at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
