"Do not buy Russian goods!" (Ukrainian: Не купуй російське!, romanized: Ne kupui rosiiske!) or "Boycott Russian goods!" (Ukrainian: Бойкотуй російське!, romanized: Boikotui rosiiske!) is a nonviolent resistance campaign to boycott Russian commerce in Ukraine. The protest started on 14 August 2013 as a reaction to a Russian Federation trade embargo against Ukraine. It was organized by Vidsich on social media. The campaign expanded to mass distribution of leaflets, posters, and stickers in over 45 cities and towns. Having faded by the beginning of the Euromaidan demonstrations in November 2013, it was renewed on 2 March 2014, during the Crimean crisis and the Russo-Ukrainian War.
