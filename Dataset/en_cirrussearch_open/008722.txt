The Soviet Union men's national basketball team (Russian: Сбо́рная СССР по баскетболу, tr. sbórnaya SSSR po basketbolu) was the national basketball team that represented the Soviet Union in international competitions. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the successor countries all set up their own national teams. Based on the number of medals, the basketball program of the former Soviet Union remains one of the most successful in the history of international basketball competitions, behind that of the United States but ahead of Spain.
