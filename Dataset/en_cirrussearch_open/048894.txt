Moldova competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation's third consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics in the post-Soviet era. Moldova sent a total of 33 athletes (26 men and 7 women), competing in eight various sports. Fourteen of them had competed previously in Sydney, including two Olympic bronze medalists: welterweight boxer Vitalie Gru≈üac and running target shooter and four-time Olympian Oleg Moldovan. Being the oldest and most sophisticated athlete (aged 37), Moldovan was appointed by the National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Moldova to carry the nation's flag in the opening ceremony. For the first time since the nation's Summer Olympic debut in 1996, the Moldovans failed to claim a single medal at these Games. Weightlifter Alexandru Bratan narrowly missed the podium with a fourth-place finish in the men's heavyweight class.
