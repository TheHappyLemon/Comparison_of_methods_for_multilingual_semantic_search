Jeanne du Barry is a 2023 historical drama film written, directed, and produced by Maïwenn and starring herself and Johnny Depp in the leading roles. It also stars Pierre Richard, Benjamin Lavernhe, Noémie Lvovsky, Pascal Greggory, Melvil Poupaud, and India Hair. Its plot centres on Madame du Barry, who uses her intelligence and allure to rise in society. She becomes King Louis XV's favourite, they fall in love, and against all propriety and etiquette, du Barry moves to Versailles, where her relationship with the king scandalises the court. Jeanne du Barry is a co-production between France, Belgium and the United Kingdom. It was produced by Why Not Productions and Depp's IN.2 Film, a European sister company to his L.A.-based Infinitum Nihil and is distributed by Le Pacte. With its budget of $22.4 million, Jeanne du Barry was one of the most expensive French films of 2023, one of only three French films with a budget over 10 million euros. The film had its world premiere as the opening film at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival on 16 May 2023 and was released theatrically in France on the same day by Le Pacte, 15 months in advance of its scheduled streaming release on Netflix in France.
