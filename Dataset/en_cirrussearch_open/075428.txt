Vanilla Ninja is an Estonian all-female rock band which enjoyed chart success in a number of countries across Europe, especially in Estonia, Germany and Austria. The group formed in 2002 and released their self-titled debut album Vanilla Ninja, containing songs in both English and Estonian, the following year. After their debut single "Club Kung Fu" was released in 2003, the girls had many hits in Central Europe, including "Tough Enough", "When the Indians Cry", "Blue Tattoo" and "I Know". They also entered Estonian national selections for the Eurovision Song Contest in 2003 and 2007, failing both times, but proved successful in 2005, when they represented Switzerland with the song "Cool Vibes". The group finished 8th in the Eurovision Song Contest final, despite topping the leader board at the half-way stage. Vanilla Ninja were very popular in their native Estonia and have had a brand of both ice cream and curd snack named after them, marketed exclusively in their homeland due to their celebrity status in Estonia. The group released five albums in various countries across Europe — Vanilla Ninja was released in 2003, Traces of Sadness in 2004, and Blue Tattoo and Best Of (though not by themselves) in 2005. The group's fourth album, Love is War, was released in May 2006, and Encore was released in October 2021. The band was originally a four-piece group consisting of Maarja Kivi, Lenna Kuurmaa, Katrin Siska and Piret Järvis. Maarja Kivi left the group in 2004 and was replaced by Triinu Kivilaan. In December 2005 she also left the group to start a solo career and finish school, and the band decided to continue as a three-piece act. Triinu rejoined for their 2021 album 'Encore'. Katrin and Triinu left the band 2022.
