The 2002 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XIX Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, from February 8 to February 24, 2002. A total of 2,399 athletes from 77 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) (+5 from 1998 Olympics) participated in these Games, competing in 78 events (+10 from 1998) in 15 sports and disciplines (+1 from 1998). Athletes from 24 countries won at least one medal. Germany led in overall medals (36) for the second consecutive Winter Games. Immediately following the Games, Germany was also the gold medal leader with twelve. With 36 total medals, Germany set a record for most total medals at a Winter Olympics. Two years later, however, Norway was awarded two extra gold medals for a single event (where two Norwegians tied), raising their total to thirteen and giving them the lead in gold medals (albeit not in the number of won events). In addition, Norway tied the former Soviet Union in 1976 for most gold medals at a Winter Olympics. This record would later be broken by Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics. The United States, the host nation, was third in the medal count with a total of 34 medals. Croatia and Estonia won the first medals and first gold medals in their Winter Olympic history, while Australia and China won their first gold medals. Biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen of Norway won four gold medals, while Croatian alpine skier Janica Kostelić won three golds and a silver, making them the two athletes with the most medals at the Games.
