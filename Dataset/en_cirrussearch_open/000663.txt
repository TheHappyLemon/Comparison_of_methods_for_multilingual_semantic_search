Tau (/ˈtɔː, ˈtɒ, ˈtaʊ/; uppercase Τ, lowercase τ or τ{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}}; Greek: ταυ [taf]) is the nineteenth letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiceless dental or alveolar plosive IPA: [t]. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 300. The name in English is pronounced /taʊ/ or /tɔː/, but in Greek it is [taf]. This is because the pronunciation of the combination of Greek letters αυ can have the pronunciation of either [ai], [av] or [af], depending on what follows and if a diaeresis is present on the second vowel (see Greek orthography). Tau was derived from the Phoenician letter taw (𐤕). Letters that arose from tau include Roman T and Cyrillic Te (Т, т). The letter occupies the Unicode slots U+03C4 (lowercase) and U+03A4 (uppercase). In HTML, they can be produced with named entities (&tau; and &Tau;), decimal references (&#964; and &#932;), or hexadecimal references (&#x3C4; and &#x3A4;).
