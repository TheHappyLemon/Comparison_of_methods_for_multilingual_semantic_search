The Amityville Horror is a 2005 American supernatural horror film directed by Andrew Douglas and starring Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George, and Philip Baker Hall. It also featured the debut of actress Chloe Grace Moretz. Written by Scott Kosar, it is based on the novel The Amityville Horror by Jay Anson, which was previously adapted into the 1979 film of the same name, while also serving as the ninth film in the Amityville Horror film series, which documents the experiences of the Lutz family after they move into a house at 112 Ocean Avenue, Long Island. In 1974, real-life mass murderer Ronald DeFeo Jr. killed six members of his family at the same house in Amityville, New York. The film was released in the United States on April 15, 2005, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and Dimension Films. Despite negative reviews from critics, with many calling it derivative to the original film but saying it didn't deliver anything new, the film was a commercial success, grossing $107.5 million on a $19 million budget.
