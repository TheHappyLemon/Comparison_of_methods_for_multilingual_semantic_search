Czech Silesia (/saɪˈliːʒə, saɪˈliːʃiə/, also UK: /-iːziə/, US: /-iːʒiə, -iːʃə, sɪˈ-/; Czech: České Slezsko; Silesian: Czeski Ślōnsk; Lower Silesian: Tschechisch-Schläsing; German: Tschechisch-Schlesien; Polish: Śląsk Czeski) is the part of the historical region of Silesia now in the Czech Republic. Czech Silesia is, together with Bohemia and Moravia, one of the three historical Czech lands. Silesia lies in the north-east of the Czech Republic, predominantly in the Moravian-Silesian Region, with a section in the northern Olomouc Region. It is almost identical in extent with Austrian Silesia (also known as the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia), before 1918; between 1938 and 1945, part of the area was also known as Sudeten Silesia (German: Sudetenschlesien, Lower Silesian: Sudetaschläsing, Czech: Sudetské Slezsko, Silesian: Sudecki Ślōnsk, Polish: Śląsk Sudecki).
