The Kherson Art Museum (also known as the Oleksii Shovkunenko Kherson Regional Art Museum; Ukrainian: Херсонський обласний художній музей імені Олексія Шовкуненка, romanized: Khersonskyi oblasnyi khudozhnii muzei imeni Oleksiia Shovkunenka) is an art museum in Kherson, Ukraine. It is housed in Kherson's former city hall building. The museum opened on 27 May 1978. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the museum was looted by Russian troops while Kherson was occupied. A short time before the city was liberated by Ukrainian forces, the collection was moved to the Central Museum of Taurida in Simferopol in Russian-occupied Crimea.
