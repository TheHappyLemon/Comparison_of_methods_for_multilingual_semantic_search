Honestly, Nevermind is the seventh studio album by Canadian rapper and singer Drake, which was surprise-released on June 17, 2022, through OVO Sound and Republic Records. The album includes a sole guest feature from 21 Savage, and production from a variety of producers, including Gordo, Black Coffee, and frequent collaborator 40. It is the second part of what Drake described as a "trilogy of albums", following Certified Lover Boy (2021) and Her Loss (2022). A stylistic departure from Drake's previous releases, Honestly, Nevermind adopts a dance, house and Baltimore club sound. The album received generally positive reviews and debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with 204,000 album-equivalent units, becoming Drake's eleventh US number-one album. The album's singles, "Sticky" and "Massive", debuted in the top 20 in the US Billboard Hot 100, while "Jimmy Cooks" became Drake's eleventh (and 21 Savage's second) US number-one song.
