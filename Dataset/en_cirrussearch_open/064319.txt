Alfredo Talavera Díaz (Spanish pronunciation: [alˈfɾeðo talaˈβeɾa]; born 18 September 1982) is a Mexican professional footballer who captains and plays as a goalkeeper for Liga MX club Juárez and the Mexico national team. Starting his career with Guadalajara in 2003, it was during his final years with the team that he would be loaned out to Tigres UANL and Toluca, with the latter deciding to purchase him in 2010. He would join Club Universidad Nacional in 2020 and Juárez in 2022. Talavera made his debut with the national team in March 2011. Originally Mexico's third-choice goalkeeper for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup, he became the team's starting goalkeeper following issues with the first and second-choice goalkeepers, in which Mexico would ultimately win. He would go on to be called up for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, 2013 and 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, the 2014, 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa América, the Copa América Centenario, and 2016 Summer Olympics.
