Paldiski railway station (Estonian: Paldiski raudteejaam) is a railway station serving the town and Baltic Sea port of Paldiski, situated on the Pakri Peninsula of northwestern Estonia. The station is the western terminus of the Tallinn-Paldiski railway. The station opened in 1870 when a railway line was opened connecting Saint Petersburg with Paldiski, via Gatchina, Narva, Tapa and Tallinn. Currently, the station is served by Tallinn's commuter rail network, an electrified commuter rail network operated by Elron, linking the city of Tallinn with its suburbs and the surrounding countryside.
