A country's gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is the PPP value of all final goods and services produced within an economy in a given year, divided by the average (or mid-year) population for the same year. This is similar to nominal GDP per capita but adjusted for the cost of living in each country. In 2019, the estimated average GDP per capita (PPP) of all of the countries of the world was Int$ 18,381. For rankings regarding wealth, see list of countries by wealth per adult.
