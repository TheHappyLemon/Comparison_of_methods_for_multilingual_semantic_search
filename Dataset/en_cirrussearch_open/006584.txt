Garmisch Garmisch The FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2011 were the 41st FIS Alpine World Ski Championships, held 7–20 February in Germany at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria. These were the second alpine world championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which previously hosted in 1978.

The runner-up was Schladming, Austria, which hosted the next championships in 2013. Prior to landing the 2011 event in 2006, Garmisch-Partenkirchen had unsuccessfully bid to host the world championships five times in the previous two decades. Most of the competitions took place on the Kandahar slopes of Garmisch Classic, one of the two skiing areas of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The slalom course was at Gudiberg, adjacent to the Große Olympiaschanze, the ski jumping hill. Unseasonal spring-like conditions prevailed during the two weeks of competition.
