Jordan Terrell Carter, known professionally as Playboi Carti, is an American rapper and singer. An influential figure among his generation, he has contributed to the progression of rage and trap music. He first signed with the local underground record label Awful Records in 2014, and later signed with ASAP Mob's record label AWGE, in a joint venture with Interscope Records two years later. Carter gained mainstream attention following the release of his eponymous debut mixtape (2017), which peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard 200 and spawned the Billboard Hot 100-charting singles "Magnolia" and "Wokeuplikethis" (featuring Lil Uzi Vert). Carter's debut studio album, Die Lit (2018) reached further success on the Billboard 200, peaking at number three. Following a two-year hiatus, his second studio album, Whole Lotta Red (2020) debuted atop the chart and was met with critical acclaim; it was listed as among the greatest albums of that year by Rolling Stone and The Washington Post. Carter is scheduled to release his third studio album in 2024. Aside from his solo career, Carter founded the record label and creative agency Opium in 2019, through which he has signed aesthetically-similar fellow Georgia-based rappers Ken Carson and Destroy Lonely, as well as the group Homixide Gang. Musically, the label shares a similar sound characterized by dark, gritty production and avant-garde synths, reminiscent of the 1970s and 80s punk rock era. Due to this distinction, both Carter and his label have garnered a cult following.
