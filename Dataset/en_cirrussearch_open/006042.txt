.mw is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Malawi. After initial delegation, in 2002 the IANA recommended that administration of the ccTLD be transferred to the Malawi Sustainable Development Network Programme from Computer Solutions Ltd. The recommendation was implemented. Prices for .mw domains are US$100 for the first two years, followed by $50 per year thereafter.
