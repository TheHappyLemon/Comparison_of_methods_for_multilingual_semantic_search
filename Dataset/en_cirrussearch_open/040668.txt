The Süper Lig (Turkish pronunciation: [ˈsypæɾ liɟ], Super League), officially known as Trendyol Süper Lig for sponsorship reasons, is a Turkish professional league for association football clubs. It is the top-flight of the Turkish football league system and is run by the Turkish Football Federation. In the 2023 to 2024 season, twenty clubs compete, where a champion is decided and three clubs are promoted from, and relegated to the 1. Lig. The season runs from August to May, with each club playing 38 matches. Matches are played Friday through Monday. The league succeeded the Turkish Football Championship and the National Division, both being former top-level national competitions. The Süper Lig is currently 9th in the UEFA coefficient ranking of leagues based on club performances in European competitions over the last five years. A total of 75 clubs have competed in the Süper Lig, but only six have won the title to date: Fenerbahçe (28), Galatasaray (23), Beşiktaş (16), Trabzonspor (7), Başakşehir (1) and Bursaspor (1).
