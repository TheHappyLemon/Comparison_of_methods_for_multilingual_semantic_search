The Feimanka (Polish: Fejmanka), a river (stream) in Latvia (Latgale, Preiļi Municipality), is the right tributary of the Dubna river.  The 72 kilometres (45 mi) long Feimanka flows from Feimaņu ezers, passes through the city of Riebiņi and avoids the city of Preiļi from the north-west (about one and a half kilometers - one mi); main inflow - the Preiļupe. It flows into the Dubna in the village of Rožupe, about twelve kilometers before the latter's mouth to the Daugava.
