Khotyn (Ukrainian: Хотин, pronounced [xoˈtɪn]; Romanian: Hotin, pronounced [hoˈtin]; see other names) is a city in Dnistrovskyi Raion, Chernivtsi Oblast of western Ukraine, located south-west of Kamianets-Podilskyi. It hosts the administration of Khotyn urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, it has a population of 11,124. Current population: 8,936 (2022 estimate). Khotyn, first chronicled in 1001, is located on the right (southwestern) bank of the Dniester River, and is part of the historical region Bessarabia. Important architectural landmarks within the city include the Khotyn Fortress, constructed in the 13-15th centuries (new fortress started in 1325, major improvements in the 1380s and 1460s), and two 15th century constructions by Moldavia's ruler Stephen the Great: the Prince's Palace (Palatul Domnesc) and the city's clock tower. Historically, the town was part of the Principality of Moldavia (1359–1432, 1459–1538, 1541–1562, 1572–1615, 1617–1620, 1621–1673, 1674–1684, 1699–1712) and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1432–1459, 1538–1541, 1562–1572, 1615–1617, 1620–1621, 1673–1674, 1684–1699). For most of the period after 1514, Moldavia was a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, which also ruled Khotyn directly (1711–1812). Subsequently, it was part of the Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire (1812–1917), Moldavian Democratic Republic (1917–1918), Romania (1918–1940, 1941–1944), the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union (1940–1941, 1944–1991) and independent Ukraine (1991–present).
