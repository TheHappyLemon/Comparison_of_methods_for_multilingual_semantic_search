The 1994 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships was the 58th such event sanctioned by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). Teams representing 35 countries participated in several levels of competition, with an additional two national teams failing to advance from a mid-season preliminary qualifying tournament. The competition also served as qualifications for group placements in the 1995 competition. The top Championship Group A tournament took place in Italy from 25 April to 8 May 1994, with games played in Bolzano, Canazei and Milan. Twelve teams took part, with the first round being split into two groups of six, with the four best teams from each group advancing to the quarter-finals. Canada beat Finland in a shootout to capture gold for the first time since 1961. This was Canada's 20th world title in ice hockey. Great Britain returned to Group A for the first time since 1962, but failed to even earn a point. Slovakia, Belarus, Croatia, and Estonia all debuted in Group C, the Slovaks winning the top group, the Estonians winning the bottom group that would be called Group D in two years.
