Livonian cuisine consists of the cuisine of Livonia and the Livonians, and is characterized by the rich use of local foods. Livonians are a coastal people – since they acquire the bulk of their food from the sea, Livonian families have historically eaten a great deal of fish. The most preferred of these is European flounder (Livonian: liestād), but many also consume herring (ēriņ), salted herring, and cod (tūrska).[citation needed]
