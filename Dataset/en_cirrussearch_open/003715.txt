Mount Menzies is the culminating peak (3,355 m; 11,007 ft) on the large massif between Mount Mather and Mount Bayliss, standing on the south side of Fisher Glacier, Antarctica. It was sighted by Flying Officer J. Seaton from an ANARE Beaver aircraft in 1956, and mapped by an ANARE southern seismic party under K.B. Mather in 1957–58. Mount Menzies was named by ANCA after the Rt. Hon. Robert Menzies, Prime Minister of Australia, 1939–41 and 1949–66.
