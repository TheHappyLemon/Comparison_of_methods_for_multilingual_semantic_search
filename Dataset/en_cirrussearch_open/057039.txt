Engie SA (stylised in all caps as ENGIE) is a French multinational utility company, with its headquarters in La Défense, Courbevoie, which operates in the fields of electricity generation and distribution, natural gas, nuclear, renewable energy and petroleum. It is active in both upstream (engineering, purchasing, operation, maintenance) and downstream (waste management, dismantling) activities. Engie supplies electricity in 27 countries in Europe and 48 countries worldwide. The company, formed on July 22, 2008, by the merger of Gaz de France and Suez, traces its origins to the Universal Suez Canal Company founded in 1858 to construct the Suez Canal. As of 2018, Engie employed 158,505 people worldwide with revenues of €60.6 billion. Engie is listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris and Brussels and is a constituent of the CAC 40 index. Engie was headed from 2016 to 2020 by Isabelle Kocher, who strongly transformed the company, notably by deciding to exit coal activities and by investing in renewable energy and energy transition services. Despite the company's commitment to diversification, the majority of its primary activities still revolve around fossil fuels.
