Grob's Attack is an unconventional chess opening in which White begins with the move: 1. g4 Although it has a cult following, it is widely considered to be one of the worst possible first moves for White. International Master (IM) John Watson writes, "As far as I can tell, 1 g4 is competitive with 1 h4 for the honour of being White's worst first move. Against an informed or skilled opponent, it is simply masochistic." This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
