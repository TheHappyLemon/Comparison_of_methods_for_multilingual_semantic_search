Mount Iriga, also known as Mount Asog, is an active stratovolcano in the province of Camarines Sur, in the Philippines. It is a stratovolcano about a kilometer from Lake Buhi. It rises 1,196 m (3,924 ft) with a base diameter of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi). It has a large crater formed due to a debris avalanche. Mount Iriga, generally known for its phreatic explosions, erupted in 1628 and 1642. After these eruptions, it remained dormant.
