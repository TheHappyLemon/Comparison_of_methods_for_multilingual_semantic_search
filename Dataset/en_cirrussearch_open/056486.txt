The Old Synagogue in Dubrovnik, Croatia, is the oldest Sefardic synagogue still in use today in the world and the second oldest synagogue in Europe. It is said to have been established in 1352, but gained legal status in the city in 1408. Owned by the local Jewish community, the main floor still functions as a place of worship for the High Holy Days and special occasions, but is now mainly a city museum which hosts numerous Jewish ritual items and centuries-old artifacts.
