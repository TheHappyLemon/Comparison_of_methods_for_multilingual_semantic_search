The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. El Salvador accepted the convention on October 8, 1991, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, El Salvador has only one World Heritage Site, Joya de Cer√©n, which was inscribed in 1993.
