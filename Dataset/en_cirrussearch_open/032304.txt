Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage.Belarus accepted the convention on 12 October 1988, making its natural and historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2021[update], there are four World Heritage Sites in Belarus. The first site added to the list was the Białowieża Forest in 1992, representing an extension to the site previously listed in Poland in 1979.

In addition to Białowieża Forest, the Struve Geodetic Arc is also a transnational site, and is shared with nine other countries.
