New Order (Spanish: Nuevo orden) is a 2020 Mexican-French thriller art film. It takes place in a dystopian near future Mexico. It was written, directed, produced and edited by Michel Franco and is a French-Mexican co-production. The film had its world premiere on September 10, 2020 at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize. Shots of darker-skinned underclass attacking a lighter-skinned elite provoked a furious backlash on Mexican social media when its trailer was released because of its perceived racial stereotyping. The criticism towards the film continued after its premiere in theaters and still remained after its release in streaming. The film stars Naian González Norvind, Diego Boneta and Mónica Del Carmen.
