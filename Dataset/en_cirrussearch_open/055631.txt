The Senne (French: [sɛn]) or Zenne (Dutch: [ˈzɛnə]) is a small river that flows through Brussels, Belgium. Its source is in the village of Naast near the municipality of Soignies. It is an indirect tributary of the Scheldt, through the Dyle and the Rupel. It joins the Dyle at Zennegat in Battel, north of the municipality of Mechelen, only a few hundred metres before the Dyle itself joins the Rupel. In total, the Senne is 103 km (64 mi) long. The Woluwe and the Maalbeek are some of its tributaries.
