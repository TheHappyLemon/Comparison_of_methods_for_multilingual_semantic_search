Rūdolfs Pērle (1875, present-day Bilska Parish – 1917, Saint Petersburg) was a Latvian painter. For a large part of his life, he specialised in producing still lifes, but widened his artistic range following his experiences during World War I and is today recognised as an important Latvian Symbolist.
