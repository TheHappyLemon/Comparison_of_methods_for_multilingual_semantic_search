The 2008 NHL Entry Draft was the 46th NHL Entry Draft. It was hosted by the Ottawa Senators at Scotiabank Place in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, on June 20â€“21, 2008. The Senators were originally awarded the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, but because of the lockout, that draft was scaled back significantly from its usual format of being open to the public and having many draft-eligible players in attendance. The actual 2005 drafting was held in Ottawa's Westin Hotel instead of the Corel Centre, as Canadian Tire Centre was then known. As a result of 2005's abridged draft, Ottawa was compensated with the 2008 draft.
