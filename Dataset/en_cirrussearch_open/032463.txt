Huhtamäki Oyj (styled Huhtamaki) is a global food packaging specialist, headquartered in Espoo, Finland. Its products include paper and plastic disposable tableware, such as cups, plates and containers for quick service restaurants, coffee shops, retail stores, caterers and vending operators. The company provides coated paper cups for fast food chains such as Burger King, as well as flexible packaging and labels for food and drink, pet food, pharmaceuticals, household and hygiene brands. Huhtamaki also makes egg cartons and trays, fruit trays and cup carriers. The company is a pioneer in exploring and using new sustainable materials, such as bio-plastics and recyclable materials. Huhtamaki was initially established as a manufacturer of confectionery in 1920 in Finland and grew in size over the years, eventually becoming an industrial conglomerate with such diverse product lines as ladies' clothing, pharmaceuticals and electronic components. A packaging division was established in 1965 under the Polarpak brand. In 1988, the company decided to concentrate on a single business area where it could be world-leading. Many business units were divested over the following decade, including the pharmaceutical division Leiras (sold to Schering) and the original candy business (which by this point included the Leaf brand). During the same period, many packaging companies were acquired. Today Huhtamaki is solely focused on the packaging sector with around 16,000 employees in over 30 countries. Its North American operations are based within the Kansas City Metropolitan Area in De Soto, Kansas. The parent company Huhtamäki Oyj is listed on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd.
