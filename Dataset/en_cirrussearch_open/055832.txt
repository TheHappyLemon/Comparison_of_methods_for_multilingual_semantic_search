Kotelny Island (Russian: Остров Котельный, tr. Ostrov Kotelny; Yakut: Олгуйдаах Aрыы, romanized: Olguydaax Arııta) is part of the Anzhu Islands subgroup of the New Siberian Islands located between the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea in the Russian Arctic. It is administratively and municipally part of Bulunsky District of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). Kotelny, Faddeyevsky and Bunge Land are usually named as separate islands on most 20th century maps, although sometimes on the newest maps the name "Kotelny" is applied to the whole island. A flat, low-lying, plain connecting both is known as Bunge Land (Russian: Земля Бунге). The total area of Kotelny Island is 23,165 km2. Kotelny is one of the 50 largest islands in the world. These merged islands are a practically uninhabited territory belonging to Yakutia of the Russian Federation.
