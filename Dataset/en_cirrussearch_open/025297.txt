Dmitry Aleksandrovich Koldun (Belarusian: Дзмітры Аляксандравіч Калдун, Dzmitry Kaldun; Russian: Дми́трий Алекса́ндрович Колду́н; born 11 June 1985) is a Belarusian pop singer. Koldun rose to fame through his participation in several Russian television talent shows. In 2006, he won the sixth season of Fabrika Zvyozd. He acquired further fame when he represented Belarus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 with "Work Your Magic". Koldun finished sixth overall, which remains the country's most successful result to date. He starred as Joaquín in the rock opera "Звезда и Смерть Хоакина Мурьеты" (The Star and the Death of Joaquín Murety) staged at the Lenkom Theatre. After his Fabrika Zvyozd and Eurovision success, Koldun was catapulted into a teen idol status in the Russophone world, but later grew into a more mature image. In total, Koldun has released five studio albums and one extended play. With his general scandal-free image, Koldun has become one of the most respected and popular performers in his native Belarus and has enjoyed longterm commercial success in neighbouring Russia.
