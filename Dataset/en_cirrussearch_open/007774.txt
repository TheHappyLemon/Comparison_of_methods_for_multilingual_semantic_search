The International Hockey League (IHL) (Russian: Межнациональная хоккейная лига (МХЛ), romanized: Mezhnatsional'naya khokkeynaya liga) lasted from 1992 to 1996. It replaced the Soviet Union's Championship league. The last season was in 1995–96, as the league was replaced by the Russian Superleague the following season. There were two awards in the league. One was the regular season winner, and the other was the winner of the cup.
