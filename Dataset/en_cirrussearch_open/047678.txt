GNU Image Manipulation Program, commonly known by its acronym GIMP (/ɡɪmp/ GHIMP), is a free and open-source raster graphics editor used for image manipulation (retouching) and image editing, free-form drawing, transcoding between different image file formats, and more specialized tasks. It is extensible by means of plugins, and scriptable. It is not designed to be used for drawing, though some artists and creators have used it in this way. GIMP is released under the GPL-3.0-or-later license and is available for Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.
