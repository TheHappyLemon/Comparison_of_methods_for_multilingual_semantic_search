Python is a genus of constricting snakes in the Pythonidae family native to the tropics and subtropics of the Eastern Hemisphere. The name python was proposed by Fran√ßois Marie Daudin in 1803 for non-venomous flecked snakes. Currently, 10 python species are recognized as valid taxa. Three formerly considered python subspecies have been promoted, and a new species recognized.[when?]
