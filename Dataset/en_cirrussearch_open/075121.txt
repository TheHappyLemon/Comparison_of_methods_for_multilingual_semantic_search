The men's 77 kilograms weightlifting event was the fourth lightest men's event at the weightlifting competition, limiting competitors to a maximum of 77 kilograms of body mass. The whole competition took place on August 13, but was divided in two parts due to the number of competitors. Group B weightlifters competed at 10:00, and Group A at 19:00. This event was the ninth weightlifting event to conclude. Each lifter performed in both the snatch and clean and jerk lifts, with the final score being the sum of the lifter's best result in each. The athlete received three attempts in each of the two lifts; the score for the lift was the heaviest weight successfully lifted.
