Coritiba Foot Ball Club, commonly known as Coritiba and colloquially referred to as "Coxa", is a Brazilian football club from Curitiba, capital city of the Brazilian state of Paraná. Founded in 1909 by German immigrants, it is the oldest football club and the club with most titles on the state. Coritiba's home stadium is the Estádio Couto Pereira, built in 1932, with the capacity of 40,000 fans. Its main rivalry is with Athletico Paranaense, with whom it plays the Atletiba derby, one of the great rivalries in Brazilian football, also competing in the derby Paratiba, which is disputed with Paraná Clube. Coritiba was the first club from Paraná to win the Brazilian Championship in 1985, breaking the hegemony of teams from São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais that had lasted since the 1960s. It has also won two Brazilian Championship Série B titles, in 2007 and 2010. The club won the Paraná State Championship 39 times – more than both of its main rivals combined (Athletico Paranaense having 27 titles and Paraná Clube 7). In June 2023, Treecorp Investimentos completed the purchase of 90% of the club's SAF, in a deal valued at 1.1 billion reais.
