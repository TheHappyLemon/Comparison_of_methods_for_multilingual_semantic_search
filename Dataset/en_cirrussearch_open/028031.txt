Free and open-source software portal Knockout is a standalone JavaScript implementation of the Model–View–ViewModel pattern with templates. The underlying principles are therefore: a clear separation between domain data, view components and data to be displayed the presence of a clearly defined layer of specialized code to manage the relationships between the view components The latter leverages the native event management features of the JavaScript language. These features streamline and simplify the specification of complex relationships between view components, which in turn make the display more responsive and the user experience richer. Knockout was developed and is maintained as an open source project by Steve Sanderson.
