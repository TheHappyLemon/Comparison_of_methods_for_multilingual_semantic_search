The Second Battle of Mohács, also known as the Battle of Harsány Mountain, was fought on 12 August 1687 between the forces of Ottoman Sultan Mehmed IV, commanded by the Grand Vizier Sarı Süleyman Pasha, and the forces of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, commanded by Charles of Lorraine. The result was a decisive victory for the Austrians. The Second Battle of Mohács can be seen as a complete reversal of the First Battle of Mohács, as its aftermath led into the reconquest of the historical territories of Kingdom of Hungary and re-establishment of the kingdom under Habsburg rule.
