Massive Attack are an English trip hop collective formed in 1988 in Bristol by Robert "3D" Del Naja, Adrian "Tricky" Thaws, Andrew "Mushroom" Vowles and Grant "Daddy G" Marshall. The debut Massive Attack album, Blue Lines, was released in 1991. The single "Unfinished Sympathy" reached the charts and was later voted the 63rd-greatest song of all time in a poll by NME. 1998's Mezzanine (containing the top 10 single "Teardrop") and 2003's 100th Window reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. Both Blue Lines and Mezzanine feature in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Massive Attack's awards include a Brit Award for Best British Dance Act, two MTV Europe Music Awards, and two Q Awards. They have released five studio albums that have sold over 13 million copies worldwide. Massive Attack support some political, human rights and environmental causes.
