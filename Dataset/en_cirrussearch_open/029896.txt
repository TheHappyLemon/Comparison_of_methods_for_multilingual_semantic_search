The Nokia 3250 (code-named Thunder) is a mobile phone running Symbian OS v9.1 (S60 3rd Edition), announced on 26 September 2005. It features a unique 'twist' design that transforms the traditional phone keypad into a camera (90° CW/CCW) and dedicated music control keys (180° CCW). It was marketed as a music phone and can store up to 2 gigabytes of music (500 songs) and other data thanks to a microSD memory card slot, and features a two-megapixel camera as well as other smartphone capabilities. The triband GSM 900/1800/1900 model started shipping in the first quarter of 2006 with an estimated retail price of 300 EUR before subsidies or taxes.
