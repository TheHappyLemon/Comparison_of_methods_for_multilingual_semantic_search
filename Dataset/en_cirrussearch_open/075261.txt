Bojan Krkić Pérez (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈboʝaŋ ˈkiɾkitʃ ˈpeɾeθ]; Serbian Cyrillic: Бојан Кркић Перез, pronounced [bǒjan kr̩̂kitɕ pěrez]; born 28 August 1990), also known as simply Bojan, is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a forward or winger. Bojan began his career at Barcelona after progressing through the youth ranks at La Masia. His early promise saw him make his first-team debut at the age of 17 years and 19 days, breaking the record set by Lionel Messi. In his debut season, he scored 12 goals in 48 matches. In total, he spent four seasons at Camp Nou, scoring 41 goals in 162 games before he was sold in July 2011 to Italian side Roma for a fee of €12 million. While in Rome, he scored seven goals in 37 appearances in 2011–12 and then spent the 2012–13 on loan at Milan, where he scored three goals in 27 games. Roma did not exercise their option of an additional €28 million to sign Bojan definitively, and so Barcelona re-signed him for €13 million. He spent the 2013–14 season on loan at Dutch club Ajax with whom he helped win the Eredivisie title. In July 2014, Bojan joined the English club Stoke City for €1.8 million. After subsequent loans to play on the European continent, once for FC Mainz 05 in 2017, and in his home country Spain for Alavés in 2018, Krkić then played in North America for a season for the Montreal Impact, and then finally in Japan for Vissel Kobe for two seasons before being released by his club in January 2023, retiring from professional football two month later. As a Spanish youth international, he won European Championships with the Under-17 team in 2007 and the Under-21 team in 2011, as well as earning his only cap for the senior team in 2008. He has also represented the Catalan regional team eight times since 2007.
