Albert Montañés Roca (Catalan: [əlˈβɛɾt muntəˈɲes ˈrɔkə], Spanish: [alˈβeɾ montaˈɲes ˈroka]; born 26 November 1980) is a Spanish former professional tennis player. He first entered the top 100 in 2001, achieved a career-high singles ranking of world No. 22 in 2010, and has won six singles titles and two doubles titles. Montañés is one of very few players to win a title after saving match points in two different matches. He did it during his title run in Estoril 2009 in his quarter-finals and the final. He holds the record for most first-round exits at Grand Slam events; 35 reached at 2016 Wimbledon, beating Kenneth Carlsen's long standing record of 30 first-round exits. Montañés' career ended at the 2017 Barcelona Open, where he lost to countryman Feliciano López in the second round.
