Juris Alunāns (official name Gustavs Georgs Frīdrihs Alunāns; May 13, 1832 – April 18, 1864) was a Latvian writer and philologist in the Russian Empire. He was one of the first contributors of the Latvian language. He was one of the members of the Young Latvia movement. Alunāns created about 500 neologisms, most of which were quickly incorporated in the everyday Latvian language and are still being used.
