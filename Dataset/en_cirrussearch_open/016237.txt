The UCI Continental Circuits are a series of road bicycle racing competitions which were introduced in 2005 by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) to expand cycling around the world. The five circuits (representing the continents of Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania) are ranked below the UCI World Tour and, as of 2020, the UCI ProSeries.
