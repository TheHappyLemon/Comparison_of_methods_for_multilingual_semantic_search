The Nevėžis (Lithuanian: [nʲɛˈvʲěːʑɪs] ) is the sixth longest river in Lithuania and one of the main tributaries of the Nemunas. The 209 km (130 mi) long Nevėžis flows entirely within the geographical confines of Lithuania. Among the rivers that flow exclusively within Lithuania's borders, the Nevėžis is the second longest, after the Šventoji. Its source is in the Anykščiai District Municipality. The river first flows in a northwesterly direction, but at Panevėžys it turns southwest, and passing Kėdainiai, flows into the Neman just west of Kaunas near Raudondvaris.
