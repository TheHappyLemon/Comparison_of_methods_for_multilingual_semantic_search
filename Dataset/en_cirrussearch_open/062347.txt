The Estadio BBVA, formerly known as the Estadio BBVA Bancomer, is an association football stadium Guadalupe, Greater Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. Nicknamed "El Gigante de Acero" in Spanish (lit. 'The Steel Giant'), the stadium replaced the Estadio Tecnológico as the home of C.F. Monterrey, ending 63 years of residency at that stadium. The stadium was inaugurated on 2 August 2015 with the eighth edition of the Eusébio Cup, where Monterrey defeated Benfica 3–0. The stadium is expected to host matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The project was met with controversy, stemming from multiple accusations of the construction as an apparent impediment to wildlife growth on a local scale by deforesting 24.5 hectares of forest neighboring a natural protected area that houses 106 animal species, including 8 endangered or protected species such as the yellow headed parrot.
