Estonian Air was the flag carrier airline of Estonia between 1991 and 2015. Headquartered in Tallinn it operated scheduled services from Tallinn Airport. Prior to its closure, the airline flew from Tallinn to 11 destinations in Europe. From 1991 to 1996, and again from 2010, Estonian Air was owned by the Estonian government. In 2010, the Estonian government had purchased the company back from SAS Group to ensure it did not go bankrupt. On 7 November 2015, the European Commission ruled that the government funding given to the company had been in breach of the European Union regulations and must be paid back. Estonian Air, not having such funds, ceased all its operations the next day and immediately entered the process of liquidation. A new state-owned airline, Nordica, entered operations the same day.
