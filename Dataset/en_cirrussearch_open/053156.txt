Hans-Dieter "Hansi" Flick (German pronunciation: [ˈhanzi ˈflɪk]; born 24 February 1965) is a German professional football manager and former player. A former player at SV Sandhausen, Bayern Munich and 1. FC Köln, Flick began his managerial career at fourth-division club Victoria Bammental as a player-manager. In 2000, he was appointed manager of fellow fourth-division side 1899 Hoffenheim, with whom he gained promotion to the Regionalliga Süd, before departing in 2005. Between 2006 and 2014, he was the assistant coach of Germany under manager Joachim Löw as they won the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and subsequently served as sporting director of the German Football Association until 2017. Having rejoined Bayern Munich as an assistant coach in 2019, Flick was made interim manager following the departure of Niko Kovač in November 2019. He was later appointed permanently, and won the UEFA Champions League that season, completing the club's second continental treble. In 2021, he also led the side to a FIFA Club World Cup and another Bundesliga title. Alongside Pep Guardiola, he is one of the only two managers to achieve a sextuple with their team. He later replaced Löw in charge of the Germany national team in 2021, leading the team to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, before being dismissed in 2023 following a run of disappointing results.
