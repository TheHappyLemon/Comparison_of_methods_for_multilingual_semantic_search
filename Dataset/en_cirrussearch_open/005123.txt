Gilbert Jay Arenas Jr. (/əˈriːnəz/ ə-REE-nəz; born January 6, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player. Arenas attended Grant High School in the Valley Glen district of Los Angeles, and accepted a scholarship offer to the University of Arizona late in his junior year. He was drafted by the Golden State Warriors with the 31st overall pick in the 2001 NBA draft. Arenas is a three-time NBA All-Star, three-time member of the All-NBA Team, and was voted the NBA Most Improved Player in the 2002–03 season. Arenas was nicknamed "Agent Zero", due to his former jersey number and his late-game shot-making ability. He has also been nicknamed "Gibby." Both names quickly became fan favorites during his time in the Washington, D.C. area. Arenas was suspended for most of the 2009–10 NBA season because of handgun violations stemming from an episode on December 24, 2009, and for subsequent actions that appeared to make light of this episode. In late 2010, Arenas was traded to the Orlando Magic. After the 2011 NBA lockout, Arenas was the first NBA player to be waived under the "amnesty clause". He signed with the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2011–12 NBA season.
