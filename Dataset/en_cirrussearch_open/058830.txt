Waring Point (Russian: Мыс Уэринг) is a headland of the Chukchi Sea. Administratively, it belongs to the Chukotka, Russian Federation. It is the easternmost point of Wrangel Island. This headland was named in 1881 after Lieutenant Waring of USS Rodgers, commanded by Lieutenant Robert M. Berry. Lt. Waring was the first to land at this point.
