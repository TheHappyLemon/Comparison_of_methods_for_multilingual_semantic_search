The 1989–90 European Cup was the 35th edition of Europe's premier club football tournament, the European Cup. The final was played at the Praterstadion in Vienna on 23 May 1990. The final was contested by Italian defending champions Milan and Portuguese two-time former winners Benfica. Milan successfully defended their title with a 1–0 victory, securing their fourth European Cup trophy. Milan remained the last team to successfully defend their trophy until Real Madrid did it again in 2017. Arsenal were denied a place in the competition, as this was the last year of a ban from European competitions for English clubs following the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985.
