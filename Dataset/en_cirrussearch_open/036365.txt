Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Libya accepted the convention on 13 October 1978. There are five World Heritage Sites in Libya, with a further three on the tentative list. The first three sites in Libya were added to the list in 1982 and the most recent one in 1986. All five sites are listed due to their cultural significance. Since 2016, all five sites have been listed as endangered because of the instability due to the Libyan civil war.
