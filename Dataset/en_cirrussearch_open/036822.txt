Bacteriophage AP205 is a plaque-forming bacteriophage that infects Acinetobacter bacteria. Bacteriophage AP205 is a protein-coated virus with a positive single-stranded RNA genome. It is a member of the family Fiersviridae, consisting of particles that infect Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli. AP205 was isolated from the gram negative species Acinetobacter. Sewage from Quebec, Canada was scanned for bacteriophages that replicated in Acinetobacter bacteria. AP205 was isolated by enrichment methods from urine by P. J. M. Bouvet. The virus was attached to a pili of Acinetobacter. Using electron microscopy, researchers were able to describe the physical characteristics of AP205.
