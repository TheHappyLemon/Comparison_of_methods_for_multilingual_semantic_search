The minute is a unit of time defined as equal to 60 seconds. One hour contains 60 minutes. Although not a unit in the International System of Units (SI), the minute is accepted for use in the SI. The SI symbol for minutes is min (without a dot). The prime symbol â€² is also sometimes used informally to denote minutes. In the UTC time standard, a minute on rare occasions has 61 seconds, a consequence of leap seconds; there is also a provision to insert a negative leap second, which would result in a 59-second minute, but this has never happened in more than 40 years under this system.
