Lactide is the lactone cyclic ester derived by multiple esterification between two (usually) or more molecules from lactic acid (2-hydroxypropionic acid) or other hydroxy carboxylic acid. They are designated as dilactides, trilactides, etc., according to the number of hydroxy acid residues. The dilactide derived from lactic acid has the formula [CH(CH3)CO2]2. All lactides are colorless or white solids. This lactide has attracted interest because it is derived from abundant renewable resources and is the precursor to a biodegradable plastic.
