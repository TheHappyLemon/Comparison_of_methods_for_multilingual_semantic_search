A trigger guard is a protective loop surrounding the trigger of a firearm designed to prevent unwanted contact with the trigger, which may cause an accidental discharge. Other devices that use a trigger-like actuator mechanism, such as inhalers, crossbows and power tools, may also have trigger guards. On rifles with a bottom metal, the trigger guard is often incorporated as part of the bottom metal.
