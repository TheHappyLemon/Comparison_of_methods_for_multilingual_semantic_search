Elisabeth Görgl (born 20 February 1981) is a retired World Cup alpine ski racer from Austria. Born in Bruck an der Mur, Styria, Görgl made her World Cup debut in March 2000 and has reached World Cup podiums in all five alpine disciplines, with multiple victories in giant slalom, super-G, and downhill. In January 2008, she won her first World Cup race in the giant slalom at Maribor, Slovenia. At the 2009 World Championships at Val d'Isère, Görgl won a bronze medal in super combined. In 2011 at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, she won two gold medals, the first in the Super-G and a second in the downhill five days later. Her sweep of the two women's speed events marked the third consecutive occurrence at the World Championships – preceded by Lindsey Vonn in 2009 at Val d'Isere and Anja Pärson in 2007 at Åre. At the 2010 Winter Olympics, Görgl won the bronze medal in the downhill – the same medal in the same event as her mother half a century earlier at the 1960 and the 1964 Winter Olympics. A week later she also won bronze in the giant slalom. Görgl also participated in 4 disciplines in the 2014 Winter Olympics (Downhill, giant slalom, super-G, combined). On 12 June 2017 she announced her retirement from active skiing. Her last race was a Super-G in Aspen in March the same year.
