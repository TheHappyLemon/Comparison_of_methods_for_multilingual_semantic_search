The Ciecere River is a right-bank tributary of the Venta River, flowing through the Saldus and Kuldīga districts. The basin is mostly located in the East Curonian Spit, where the 50 m-deep Lake Ciecere has formed in subglacial deposits, from which the Ciecere flows. The Mazupe River [lv], a tributary of Lake Ciecere, is sometimes considered to be the origin of the Ciecere, which flows westward.
