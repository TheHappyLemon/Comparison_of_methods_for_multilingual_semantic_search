The Blue Palace (Montenegrin: Плави дворац, romanized: Plavi dvorac) was built as the heir's palace in Cetinje, Montenegro. Today the Blue Palace is the official residence of the President of Montenegro. It was built in 1894–1895 in late Empire style as the residence of Crown Prince Danilo of Montenegro, then heir-apparent to the throne. The building was a model for the construction of other buildings for the members of the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty throughout Montenegro.
