This is a list of heads of state of Mali since the country gained independence from France in 1960 to the present day. A total of seven people have served as head of state of Mali (excluding three acting presidents). Additionally, two people, Amadou Toumani Touré and Assimi Goïta, have served on two non-consecutive occasions. The current head of state of Mali is interim president Assimi Goïta, who took power for a second time on 24 May 2021, after dismissing previous interim president Bah Ndaw in the 2021 coup d'état. He has since been constitutionally declared interim president of Mali. Since the 2023 constitutional referendum held during Goita's leadership, Mali has shifted from a semi-presidential to a full presidential system, with the president serving as the head of government and dictating the policies of the government.
