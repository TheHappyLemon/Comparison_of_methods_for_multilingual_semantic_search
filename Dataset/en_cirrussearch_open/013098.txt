The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night is a 2007 action-adventure video game in the Spyro series. It is the second installment in The Legend of Spyro trilogy and the sequel to The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning (2006). It was released for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, Wii, and mobile. Elijah Wood and Gary Oldman reprise their roles as Spyro and Ignitus, respectively, while Billy West replaces David Spade as Sparx and Mae Whitman replaces Cree Summer as Cynder from the previous game, though The Eternal Night uses recycled voice clips of Summer.
