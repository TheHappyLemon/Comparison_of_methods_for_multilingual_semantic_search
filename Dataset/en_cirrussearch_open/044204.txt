BASEketball is a 1998 American sports comedy film co-written and directed by David Zucker and starring South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with Yasmine Bleeth, Jenny McCarthy, Robert Vaughn, Ernest Borgnine, and Dian Bachar. The film is about the sport of BASEketball, a hybrid sport combining baseball and basketball that was invented by Zucker in the 1980s. Parker and Stone play childhood friends who invent the game as something they could win against more athletic types. The sport becomes an overnight sensation and a target of corporate sponsorship. This is the only work involving Parker and Stone that was neither written, directed, nor produced by them. The film was a box office disappointment and received mixed critical reviews. BASEketball is credited with coining the Internet slang term "derp".
