Soyuz 2 (Russian: Союз 2, Union 2) was an uncrewed spacecraft (capsule number 7K-OK-P No. 11) in the Soyuz family, intended to be the target of a docking maneuver by the crewed Soyuz 3 spacecraft. It was intended to be the first docking of a crewed spacecraft in the Soviet space program. Although the two craft approached closely, the docking did not take place and the first successful Soviet docking of crewed spacecraft took place in the joint Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 mission. It served for the radio search and as a target vehicle for docking by the crewed Soyuz 3. Soyuz 2 soft-landed in a predetermined area of the Soviet Union, near the village of Maiburnak, southwest of the city of Karaganda.
