Cody Michael Kolodziejzyk (born 22 November 1990; /ˌkɔːləˈdʒɛ.sɪk/ kaw-lə-JEH-sik, Polish: [kɔwɔˈd͡ʑɛjt͡ʂɨk]), better known as Cody Ko, is a Canadian YouTuber, podcaster, comedian, and rapper. His style of content is often crudely comedic and profane. As of April 2023[update], his five YouTube channels have collectively earned over 9.37 million subscribers and 1.86 billion views. After majoring in computer science at Duke University, Ko worked as a mobile developer and began to upload to Vine, garnering almost 2 million followers on the platform before it closed in 2017. He shifted to uploading commentary videos on YouTube, where he and fellow YouTuber Noel Miller became popular co-hosting their reaction video series That's Cringe and the Tiny Meat Gang Podcast. They also began a comedy rap group of the same name. In 2019, influencer Jake Paul was criticized for accusing Ko of cyberbullying in his commentary videos, inadvertently causing Ko to gain 140,000 subscribers. In 2021, Ko and Miller expanded their podcast into Tiny Meat Gang Studios, a comedy podcast network.
