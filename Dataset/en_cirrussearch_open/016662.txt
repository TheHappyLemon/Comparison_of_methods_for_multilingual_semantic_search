Post-grunge is an offshoot of grunge that has a less abrasive or intense tone than traditional grunge. Originally, the term was used almost pejoratively to label mid-1990s rock bands such as Bush, Candlebox, Collective Soul, Live, Foo Fighters, and Silverchair, that emulated the original sound of grunge. In the late 1990s, post-grunge morphed into a more clearly defined style that combined the sound and aesthetic of grunge with more commercially accessible songwriting, rising to prominence that lasted into the 2000s. Bands such as Foo Fighters, Nickelback, Staind, Puddle of Mudd, Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace, Creed, Shinedown, Seether, and Matchbox Twenty achieved mainstream success in this second wave.
