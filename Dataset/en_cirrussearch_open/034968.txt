Tuļļi Lum (Livonian for "hot snow"; often simplified as "Tulli Lum") is an Estonian/Livonian folk music band that was formed in 1999 when the Estonian ensemble found Livonian Julgī Stalte, originally from Riga, Latvia, while she was studying music in Estonia. The basis of much of the group's works are the books of the Estonian folklorist Oskar Loorits, while musically they are considered a fusion between authentic Livonian folk music and jazz.
