Stellar Dawn is a browser-based sci-fi themed MMORPG that was under development by UK game developer Jagex but was never released. Originally known as MechScape, the project was scrapped and renamed after it was decided that the completed project did not meet the standards of the original design brief. The project was overhauled and formally announced as Stellar Dawn on 14 July 2010 when Jagex released the official Stellar Dawn website. On 10 August 2010 the first official Stellar Dawn teaser was released. The game was expected to be released in 2011, the ETA posted on the official website, however in March 2012, Jagex stated that the game's development would be paused for the time being. On March 2, 2012, Jagex had stated that all development on Stellar Dawn had been "paused" so that 2012 could be their biggest year to date with the release of Transformers Universe and improvements on RuneScape. Jagex stated that they would review the status of the game after Transformers Universe was launched.
