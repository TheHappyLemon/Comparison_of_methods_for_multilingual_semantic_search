At the end of his tenure he was appointed “Director General Emeritus of the International Atomic Energy Agency”.

ElBaradei was born and raised in Giza Governorate, Greater Cairo, Egypt. He was one of five children of Mostafa ElBaradei, an attorney who headed the Egyptian Bar Association. ElBaradei's father was also a supporter of democratic rights in Egypt, supporting a free press and an independent judiciary. ElBaradei is married to Aida El Kashef, a former early-childhood teacher. They have two children: a daughter, Laila, a lawyer living in the UK; and a son, Mostafa, an IT manager living in Vienna. They also have two granddaughters, Maya and Nina. A native speaker of Arabic, ElBaradei is also fluent in English and French, and knows "enough German to get by, at least in Vienna."
