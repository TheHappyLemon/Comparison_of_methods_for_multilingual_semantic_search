"I Hate This Part" is a song by American girl group the Pussycat Dolls from their second album, Doll Domination (2008). The song was written by Wayne Hector, Lucas Secon, Jonas Jeberg, Mich Hansen and produced by the latter two along with Ron Fair and Nicole Scherzinger. It was initially recorded for Scherzinger's planned solo project, Her Name is Nicole, but after its cancellation the song was placed in the group's second album. "I Hate This Part" was released on October 14, 2008, as the second international single and impacted contemporary hit radio stations on October 20, 2008, as the fourth single in the United States by Interscope Records. "I Hate This Part" is a dance/R&B-influenced pop ballad which ditches the Pussycat Dolls's usual sexual image in favor of introspection. Lyrically, the song is about the conversation before a breakup. Contemporary music critics wrote generally positive reviews, commending the song's production and Scherzinger's vocals. "I Hate This Part" became a moderate success and peaked at number eleven on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It also reached the top ten in Australia, France, and New Zealand. A music video for the song directed by Joseph Kahn was filmed in late September 2008. It features the group at a desert with each member on a separate set exploring different emotional sides while choreographed routines were performed at the chorus. "I Hate This Part" was performed on various occasions including the 2008 American Music Awards and throughout their Doll Domination Tour (2009).
