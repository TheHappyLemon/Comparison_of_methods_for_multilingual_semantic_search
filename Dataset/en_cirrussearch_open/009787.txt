Latvia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 with the song "Beautiful Song" written by Ivars Makstnieks and Rolans Ūdris. The song was performed by Anmary. The Latvian broadcaster Latvijas Televīzija (LTV) organised the national final Eirodziesma 2012 in order to select the Latvian entry for the 2012 contest in Baku, Azerbaijan. Twenty songs were selected to compete in the national final, which consisted of three shows: two semi-finals and a final. In the semi-finals on 7 and 14 January 2012, five entries were selected to advance from each show. Ten songs ultimately qualified to compete in the final on 7 January 2012 where two rounds of voting by a public televote and a ten-member jury panel selected "Beautiful Song" performed by Anmary as the winner. Latvia was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 22 May 2012. Performing during for the show in position 4, "Beautiful Song" was not announced among the top 10 entries of the first semi-final and therefore did not qualify to compete in the final. It was later revealed that Latvia placed sixteenth out of the 18 participating countries in the semi-final with 17 points.
