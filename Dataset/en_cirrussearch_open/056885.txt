The Xerias, (Greek: Ξεριάς, from ξερός, "dry") is an arroyo in the Argolid in Greece. Its ancient name was Charadros (Χάραδρος), which is still used, although its Demotic name is by far the most common and used on modern maps. Under its ancient name, it is described in Pausanias's Description of Greece (2.25.2).
