Georgi Sedefchov Parvanov (Bulgarian: Георги Седефчов Първанов, IPA: [ɡɛˈɔrɡi pɐrˈvanof]) (born 28 June 1957) is a Bulgarian historian and politician who was President of Bulgaria from 2002 to 2012. He was elected after defeating incumbent Petar Stoyanov in the second round of the November 2001 presidential election. He took office on 22 January 2002. He was reelected in a landslide victory in 2006, becoming the first Bulgarian president to serve two terms. Parvanov supported Bulgaria's entry into NATO and the European Union. According to Bulgarian law, a Bulgarian president is not allowed to be a member of a political party, thus Parvanov left the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) after his election in 2001. Although he identified as a socialist, Parvanov often called himself a 'social president'.[citation needed] After completing his second term as president, Parvanov returned to the Socialist Party, prompting a dispute over the party leadership. In January 2014 Parvanov restarted his Alternative for Bulgarian Revival (ABV) project, announcing he would be fielding his own candidates for the 2014 European parliamentary elections. On 15 January 2017, he stepped down as party leader and was replaced by Konstantin Prodanov.
