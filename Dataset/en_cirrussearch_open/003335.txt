They are overseen by Canada Basketball, the governing body for basketball in Canada. In nine Olympic appearances, Canada has won one medal in basketball – a silver at the 1936 Games in Berlin. The team finished fourth in 1976 and 1984. Canada has won six medals at the FIBA AmeriCup – two silver medals in 1980 and 1999, as well as four bronze medals in 1984, 1988, 2001, and 2015. In recent decades, the team also won its first medals at the Pan American Games, a silver medal in 2015, and the FIBA World Cup, a bronze medal in 2023. The Canadian senior national team won its only gold medal at a university-level tournament, the 1983 Summer Universiade, which the country hosted in Edmonton, Alberta.
