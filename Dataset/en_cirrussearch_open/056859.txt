Larisa Roxana Giurgiu (Romanian pronunciation: [laˈrisa rokˈsana ˈdʒjurdʒju]; born 5 January 2000), known professionally as Roxen (pronounced [rokˈsen]), is a Romanian singer who rose to prominence after being featured on Romanian producer Sickotoy's "You Don't Love Me" (2019), which reached number three in Romania and received radio airplay in several other countries. The singer's following singles, "Ce-ți cântă dragostea" and "Spune-mi", eventually peaked atop the national chart. Roxen was scheduled to represent Romania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 with the song "Alcohol You" before the event's coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cancellation. Instead, Roxen was internally selected as the country's representative for the 2021 contest with the song "Amnesia", but failed to progress from the first semi-final, finishing in 12th place.
