Alphonso Boyle Davies (born November 2, 2000) is a professional soccer player who plays as a left-back or winger for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich and the Canada national team. He is widely regarded as one of the best full-backs in the world, and one of the best North American players of all time. Davies has earned the nickname "The Roadrunner" for his exceptional pace, dribbling ability, and creativity. Davies was the first player born in the 2000s to play in a Major League Soccer match. He joined Bayern in January 2019 from MLS side Vancouver Whitecaps FC on a contract lasting until 2023 for a then-record MLS transfer fee. Davies was named the Bundesliga Rookie of the Season for 2019â€“20. In that season he also was part of the team winning the continental treble after Bayern won the Bundesliga, the UEFA Champions League and the DFB-Pokal. His performances led him to be a finalist of 2020 Golden Boy award. Born in Ghana to refugee Liberian parents, Davies obtained Canadian citizenship in June 2017; he was until then a Liberian national. Later that month, he became the youngest player to appear for the Canada national team. By scoring two goals in a 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup match against French Guiana, he became the youngest player to score for the team, the youngest to score at the CONCACAF Gold Cup, and first player born in the 2000s to score at a top level international tournament. He would go on to be named CONCACAF Men's Player of the Year in 2021 and 2022. Davies was called up to play in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he scored Canada's first ever World Cup goal. He is widely considered both the best player on and the face of the Canada national team. Davies is the first soccer player, and first Canadian, to become an ambassador for the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR.
