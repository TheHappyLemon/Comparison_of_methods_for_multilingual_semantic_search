The Lost City of Z is a 2016 American epic biographical adventure drama film written and directed by James Gray, based on the 2009 book of the same name by David Grann. It portrays British explorer Percy Fawcett, who was sent to Brazil and made several attempts to find a supposed ancient lost city in the Amazon. It stars Charlie Hunnam as Fawcett; Robert Pattinson as his fellow explorer Henry Costin, Sienna Miller as his wife, Nina Fawcett; and Tom Holland as his son, Jack. Its world premiere was on October 15, 2016, as the closing-night selection at the New York Film Festival. It was released in the United States on April 14, 2017 by Amazon Studios and Bleecker Street. It was praised by critics, but grossed only $19 million against a $30 million budget. Despite its lack of financial success, Time magazine listed it as one of its Top 10 Films of 2017. "Z" is pronounced "zed" by the characters in the film, as is done in British English; it is pronounced "zee" by the British actors in the film's U.S.-made promotional videos to suit the local market.
