Panionios G.S.S. Football Club (Greek: ΠΑΕ Πανιώνιος Γ.Σ.Σ.), the Pan-Ionian Gymnastics Club of Smyrna (Πανιώνιος Γυμναστικός Σύλλογος Σμύρνης, Panionios Gymnastikos Syllogos Smyrnis), more commonly known as Panionios F.C. or simply Panionios, is a Greek professional football club based in Nea Smyrni, a suburban town in the Athens agglomeration, Greece. Part of Panionios G.S.S. (founded in 1890 in Smyrna, Ottoman Empire), Panionios F.C. is the oldest Greek football club. In the wake of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22) and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the multi-sport club Panionios G.S.S. was transferred to Athens. They have won two Greek Cups (in 1979 and 1998), while they were runners-up in the Greek Championship during the 1950–51 and 1970–71 seasons. They have won also the 1971 Balkans Cup and reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1998–99 season. The team currently competes in the amateur third division of Greek football known as Gamma Ethniki. They play their home games in Nea Smyrni Stadium with a capacity of 11,700 seats.
