Richard Arnold Roundtree (July 9, 1942 – October 24, 2023) was an American actor. He was best known for his portrayal of private detective John Shaft in the 1971 film Shaft and four of its sequels, Shaft's Big Score! (1972), Shaft in Africa (1973), its 2000 sequel and its 2019 sequel, as well as the eponymous television series (1973–1974). He was also known for his features in several TV series, including Roots, Generations, and Desperate Housewives. Considered as "the first Black action hero", Roundtree was credited with having an impact on the rise of African American leading actors in Hollywood projects, thanks to his successful performances in the genre. His portrayal of Shaft as a bold, confident, and charismatic figure also influenced cinematic depictions of Black men and Black masculinity, a contrast to Black men in films prior to Shaft having often been portrayed as mild-mannered or servile.
