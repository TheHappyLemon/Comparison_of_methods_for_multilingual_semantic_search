The term "century of humiliation" is used to describe the period in Chinese history beginning with the First Opium War (1839â€“1842), and ending in 1945 with China established as a great power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council or alternately the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The period is typified by the intervention and subjugation of the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China by Western powers, Russia, and Japan. The characterization of the period as a "humiliation" arose with an atmosphere of Chinese nationalism in opposition to the Twenty-One Demands made by the Japanese government in 1915, and grew further with protests against China's treatment in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. The Kuomintang and Chinese Communist Party both popularized the characterization in the 1920s, protesting the unequal treaties and loss of Chinese territory. During the 1930s and 1940s, the term became common. Although formal treaty provisions were ended, the epoch remains central to concepts of Chinese nationalism, and the term is widely used in both political rhetoric and popular culture.
