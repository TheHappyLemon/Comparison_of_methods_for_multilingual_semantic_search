The Latvian Football Cup (Latvian: Latvijas kauss) is the main knockout cup competition in Latvian football. Since 2021, its full name is Responsible Gaming Latvian Football Cup (Atbildīgas spēles Latvijas kauss) due to the sponsorship by sports betting company William Hill. The tournament was launched in 1937, replacing the previous knockout tournament – the Riga Football Cup. The competition is a knockout (single elimination) tournament. From 1937 to 2008 and again since 2017, all of the games of the tournament are played within the year. During the Soviet occupation (1940–1941, 1944–1991) it served as a qualification tournament for the Soviet Cup. The competition was also fully played once during the German occupation of the Baltic states, in 1943.
