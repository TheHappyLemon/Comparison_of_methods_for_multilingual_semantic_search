The 2009 G20 London Summit was the second meeting of the G20 heads of government/heads of state, which was held in London on 2 April 2009 at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre to discuss financial markets and the world economy. It followed the first G20 Leaders Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy, which was held in Washington, D.C., on 14â€“15 November 2008. Heads of government or heads of state from the G20 attended, with some regional and international organisations also represented. Due to the extended membership, it has been referred to as the London Summit. The policing tactics at the event raised some controversy, particularly over the death of Ian Tomlinson. In June 2013, it came to light that the British government's spy agency, Government Communications Headquarters, had listened in on computer and phone communications made by foreign summit attendees. Their actions were sanctioned by the British government, and intelligence was passed to British government ministers.
