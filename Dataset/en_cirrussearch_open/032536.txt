Lake Engure Nature Park is a protected park in Latvia covering 197.62 km2 (76.30 sq mi), named for Lake Engure. It was designated as a nature spot in 1998. The natural park belongs to the Natura 2000 network which brings together natural sites or semi-natural of the European Union with great heritage value. The text establishing the creation of the Natura 2000 network, the European “habitats, fauna and flora” speaks of natural sites of “community interest”, referring to the “heritage value” of habitats. In the field of nature conservation, we can distinguish habitats, fauna and flora according to their rarity: habitats "of regional interest" are rare in one region, but may be present in abundance elsewhere. . The same goes for habitats "of national interest", then "of European interest". The Natura 2000 network therefore applies to protect rare ecological sites at European level, and representative of the natural heritage of the Member States of the European Union, by fauna and flora exceptional that they contain. More precisely, the Habitats Directive from which the Natura 2000 network has emerged aims to protect “natural habitats”, “fauna” and “flora”. Although these three concepts are inseparable (protecting a natural habitat protects the flora and fauna found there), it would be useless to protect a natural habitat without worrying about the species that live there, and vice versa, to ensure the sustainability of a particular species without worrying about the state of the natural habitat that shelters them.
