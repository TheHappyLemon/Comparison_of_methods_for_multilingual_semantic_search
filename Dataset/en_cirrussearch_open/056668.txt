The Sandsvatn is the largest lake on the island of Sandoy and the third largest in the Faroe Islands, measuring 0.8Â km2 with a depth of 5 metres. It is situated in a valley between Skopun and Sandur, just north of the latter on Road 30. At the northern end of the lake are the island's school centre and a copse (plantation) which was badly damaged by a 1988 hurricane.[citation needed] The lake used to be rich in trout, lake trout and salmon.[citation needed] It has been called an "interesting" lake for birdwatching.
