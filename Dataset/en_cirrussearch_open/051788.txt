Buyant-Ukhaa International Airport, formerly called Chinggis Khaan International Airport from 2005 to 2020 (IATA: ULN, ICAO: ZMUB), is a semi-operational international airport serving Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, situated 18 km (11 mi) southwest of the capital. Largely replaced by a new airport, it currently functions as a backup airport for the former, with a view to be used for flight training as well as for special, charter, and government flights.
