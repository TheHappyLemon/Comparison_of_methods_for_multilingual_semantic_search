Pizza Hut is an American multinational pizza restaurant chain and international franchise founded in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas by Dan and Frank Carney. The chain, headquartered in Plano, Texas, operates 19,866 restaurants worldwide as of 2023. While studying at Wichita State University, the Carneys opened their first location, which quickly expanded to six outlets within a year. The brand began franchising in 1959, and its distinctive building style was designed by Chicago architect George Lindstrom in 1963. Pizza Hut experienced significant growth, including the acquisition by PepsiCo in 1977, followed by a spin-off into Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc., later renamed Yum! Brands in 2002, who are the current owners. Pizza Hut introduced PizzaNet in 1994, an early internet ordering experiment, and continued innovation with offerings like stuffed crust pizza introduced in 1995. Pizza Hut has adapted its model to include various restaurant formats, including the family-style dine-in locations, carry-out, and hybrid locations. It has ventured into international markets, tailoring its menu to local tastes. The brand faced challenges, including the closure of numerous dine-in locations in the US and adjustments to its franchise operations. Despite these hurdles, Pizza Hut remains a significant player in the global fast food industry, known for its innovative products and marketing strategies.
