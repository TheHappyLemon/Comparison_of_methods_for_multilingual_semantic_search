Uunartoq Qeqertaq (Greenlandic), Warming Island in English, is an island off the east central coast of Greenland, 550 kilometres (342 miles) north of the Arctic Circle. It became recognised as an island only in September 2005, by US explorer Dennis Schmitt. It was attached to the mainland of Liverpool Land by glacial ice even in 2002, when the ice shelves began retreating rapidly in this area, so that by 2005 it was no longer attached to the mainland. Members of the scientific community believe this newly discovered island is a direct result of global warming.
