"Cool" is a song by American singer Gwen Stefani from her debut solo studio album, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). Written by Stefani and Dallas Austin, the song was released as the fourth single from the album on July 5, 2005. The song's musical style and production were inspired by synth-pop and new wave arrangements from the 1980s, and its lyrics chronicle a relationship in which two lovers have separated, but remain "cool" with each other as good friends. "Cool" received generally positive reviews from music critics, being compared to Cyndi Lauper and Madonna songs from the 1980s. The media have drawn parallels between the song's lyrical content and the romantic relationship that Stefani had with Tony Kanal, a fellow band member of No Doubt. "Cool" was moderately successful on the charts around the world, peaking within the top 10 in Australia, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and New Zealand, as well as the top 20 in Denmark, Ireland, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. The accompanying music video for "Cool" was directed by Sophie Muller and filmed in Lake Como, Italy. The video features many flashbacks to when Stefani and her former boyfriend were dating. It is implied that whilst Gwen accepts the new relationship her ex-partner is in, she looks back with nostalgia and regret. "Cool" was included on the setlist for Stefani's debut solo tour Harajuku Lovers Tour and its accompanying video album, as well as in the 2006 comedies Last Holiday and Click and the 2010 drama Somewhere.
