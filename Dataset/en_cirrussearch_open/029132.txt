Puncak Jaya (Indonesian: [ˈpuntʃak ˈdʒaja]; literally "Glorious Peak", Amungme: Nemangkawi Ninggok) or Carstensz Pyramid (/ˈkɑːrstəns/, Indonesian: Piramida Carstensz, Dutch: Carstenszpiramide) on the island of New Guinea, with an elevation of 4,884 m (16,024 ft), is the highest mountain peak of an island on Earth, the highest peak in Indonesia, and the 8th highest mountain in Southeast Asia, on account of Indonesia being part of Asia. The mountain is located in the Sudirman Range of the highlands of Mimika Regency, Central Papua, Indonesia. Puncak Jaya is ranked 5th by topographic isolation. The massive, open cut Grasberg gold and copper mine, the world's second-largest gold mine, is four kilometres (2+1⁄2 miles) west of Puncak Jaya. Other summits are East Carstensz Peak (4,808 m [15,774 ft]), Sumantri (4,870 m [15,980 ft]) and Ngga Pulu (4,863 m [15,955 ft]). Other names include Nemangkawi in the Amungkal language, Carstensz Toppen and Gunung Soekarno. It is also the highest point between the Himalayas and the Andes. Some sources claim Papua New Guinea's Mt Wilhelm, 4,509 m (14,793 ft), as the highest mountain peak in Oceania.
