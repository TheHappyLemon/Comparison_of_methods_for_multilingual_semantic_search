Chandler Muriel Bing (born 1967/1968)[unreliable source?] is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by the late Matthew Perry. Chandler was born to Nora Tyler Bing, an erotic romance novelist, and Charles Bing, a gay female impersonator and star of a Las Vegas drag show called "Viva Las Gay-gas" as Helena Handbasket. Chandler is of Scottish and Swedish descent.[citation needed] He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family.[citation needed] His parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when Chandler was nine years old, an event which traumatized him, and he refuses to celebrate the holiday as an adult. It is revealed in season 2 that he went to an all-boys high school. Chandler's best friends are his roommate Joey Tribbiani, and Ross Geller, his college roommate. He met Ross's sister, Monica Geller, and her friend Rachel Green while visiting Ross's parents' house. Chandler was the first person to know about Ross's love for Rachel.[citation needed] He moved to New York City and lives across the hall from Monica. He meets Phoebe Buffay through her. Chandler has a very good sense of humor and is notoriously sarcastic, which he credits as a defense mechanism developed during his parents' divorce when he was a child. He is the most financially secure member of the Friends due to responsible income management, having learned the value of money at a young age.[citation needed] He suffers from commitment issues, but he later marries Monica at the end of season 7. In season 10, Chandler and Monica adopt twins, Jack and Erica, though they were only anticipating one baby.
