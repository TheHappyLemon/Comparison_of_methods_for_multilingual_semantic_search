Haiti made its first appearance at the Olympic Games in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. The 1924 Summer Olympics in the same city marked Haiti's first Olympic medal, when the seven members of Haiti's shooting team took third place in the free rifle competition. The next games, in 1928, saw another medal for Haiti; Silvio Cator took the silver in men's long jump. While Haiti has participated in several Olympic games since 1928, no other medals have been won. Haiti made their debut in the Winter Olympics in 2022.
