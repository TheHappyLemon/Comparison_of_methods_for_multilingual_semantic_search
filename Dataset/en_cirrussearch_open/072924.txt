The Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park (simplified Chinese: 顺义奥林匹克水上公园; traditional Chinese: 順義奧林匹克水上公園; pinyin: Shùnyì Àolínpǐkè Shuǐshàng Gōngyuán) was built for the rowing, canoeing and 10 km open-water swimming events in the 2008 Summer Olympics. It is located in Mapo Village in the Shunyi District in Beijing. The first competitions at the venue were held in August 2007, a year ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games for which it was built. The World Junior Rowing Championships, China Open Canoe/Kayak Slalom and China Canoe/Kayak Flatwater Open were all held in that month as part of the "Good Luck Beijing" series of sporting events. The 10 km marathon swimming event and the second qualifying event of the 2008 Summer Olympics were also held there.
