Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a 2014 American superhero film based on the characters of the same name created by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman. Directed by Jonathan Liebesman and written by Josh Appelbaum, André Nemec, and Evan Daugherty, it is a reboot of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film series. The film stars Megan Fox, Will Arnett, William Fichtner, Danny Woodburn, Abby Elliott, Noel Fisher, Jeremy Howard, Pete Ploszek, and Alan Ritchson, with the voices of Johnny Knoxville and Tony Shalhoub. In the film, four mutated reptilian warriors rise from the sewers to join forces with fearless reporter April O'Neil to save New York City from the Shredder and his evil minions. The film was announced shortly before Turtles co-creator Peter Laird sold the rights to the characters to Nickelodeon in October 2009. It was released on August 8, 2014, by Paramount Pictures. The film received negative reviews from critics for its tone and characterization, although its visual effects, action sequences and performances were praised. Despite this, it became a box office success, grossing $485 million against a $125–150 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing film of the series, as well as the highest-grossing film from Nickelodeon Movies. A sequel, Out of the Shadows, followed in 2016 to slightly better reviews but failed to match the first film's box-office gross.
