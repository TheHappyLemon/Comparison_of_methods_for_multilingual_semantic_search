The 2010 FIBA World Championship was the 16th FIBA World Championship, the international basketball world championship contested by the men's national teams. The tournament ran from 28 August to 12 September 2010. It was co-organised by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), Turkish Basketball Federation and the 2010 Organising Committee. It was considered as prestigious a competition as the Olympic Basketball Tournament. The tournament was hosted by Turkey. For the third time (after the 1986 and 2006 tournaments), the World Championship had 24 competing nations. As a result, the group stage games were played in four cities, and the knockout round was hosted by Istanbul. The United States won the tournament for their fourth time after going undefeated in the Opening Round and beating host Turkey in the final. The draw for the Championship took place on 15 December 2009 in Istanbul. Teams were drawn into four preliminary round groups of six teams each. Teams first played a round-robin schedule, with the top sixteen teams advancing to the knockout stage.
