The Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN) is an internet-based, interconnected network of interoperable data pools governed by GS1 standards. The GDSN enables companies around the globe to exchange standardized product master data with their trading partners. The GDSN is used as a tool to support high data quality through use of authoritative data sources, real-time data synchronization, and standardization of data formatting. The GDSN operates using a publish-subscribe pattern between two trading partners, each of which are registered with and access the GDSN via a data pool. The GS1 Global Registry acts as a directory to point to the data pool where data is housed, and matches subscription to registrations in order to facilitate synchronization.
