Duolingo (/ˌdjuːoʊˈlɪŋɡoʊ/ DEW-oh-LING-goh) is an American educational technology company that produces learning apps and provides language certification. Duolingo offers courses on music, math and over 40 languages, ranging from English, French, and Spanish to less commonly studied languages such as Welsh, Irish, and Swahili. Other services include the Duolingo English Test, an online certification program, and Duolingo ABC, a literacy app for children. The company uses a freemium model, with its optional premium service, Super Duolingo, being ad-free and offering more features. As of February 2023, Duolingo was the world's most popular language learning app based on monthly downloads, with almost 13.4 million users downloading it that month. A systematic review of research on Duolingo from 2012 to 2020 found comparatively few studies on the platform's efficacy for language learning, but identified several studies that reported relatively high user satisfaction and enjoyment and positive perceptions of the app's effectiveness.
