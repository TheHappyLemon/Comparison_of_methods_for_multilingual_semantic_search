Arno Breker (19 July 1900 â€“ 13 February 1991) was a German architect and sculptor who is best known for his public works in Nazi Germany, where they were endorsed by the authorities as the antithesis of degenerate art. He was made official state sculptor, and exempted from military service. One of his better known statues is Die Partei, representing the spirit of the Nazi Party that flanked one side of the carriage entrance to Albert Speer's new Reich Chancellery. After the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945 Breker continued to thrive professionally as a sculptor in the new West Germany.
