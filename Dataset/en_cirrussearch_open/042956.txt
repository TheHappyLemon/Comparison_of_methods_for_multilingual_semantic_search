The National Space Agency (Malay: Agensi Angkasa Negara), abbreviated ANGKASA, was the national space agency of Malaysia. It was established in 2002 and its charter aims to upgrade, stimulate and foster the country's space programme through integrated and coordinated efforts by developing and applying space technologies. In 2019, the National Space Agency (ANGKASA) was merged with the Malaysian Remote Sensing Agency (MRSA) and renamed the Malaysian Space Agency (MYSA) for greater synergy.
