The 73rd British Academy Film Awards, more commonly known as the BAFTAs, were held on 2 February 2020 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, honouring the best national and foreign films of 2019. Presented by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, accolades were handed out for the best feature-length film and documentaries of any nationality that were screened at British cinemas in 2019. The nominees were announced on 7 January 2020. The psychological thriller Joker received the most nominations in eleven categories; The Irishman and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood followed with ten apiece. The ceremony also marked the introduction of the BAFTA Award for Best Casting; Shayna Markowitz won for Joker. The ceremony also marked the tenth time an actor received dual nominations in the same category, with Margot Robbie's Best Supporting Actress nominations for both Bombshell and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. The ceremony was hosted by Graham Norton (who also hosts the BAFTA TV Awards), replacing Joanna Lumley following her two years of service as host.
