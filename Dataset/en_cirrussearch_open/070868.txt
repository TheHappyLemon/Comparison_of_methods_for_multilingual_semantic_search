Radu Matei Drăgușin (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈradu maˈtej drəguˈʃin]; born 3 February 2002) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as a defender for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and the Romania national team. Mainly a centre-back, he can also play as a right-back. Drăgușin started out his senior career with the reserves of Italian club Juventus in 2020, and later that year registered his debut for the first team, aged 18. Following loans to Sampdoria, Salernitana, and Genoa, respectively, he signed a permanent contract with the latter in 2023. The next January, he joined English side Tottenham Hotspur in a transfer worth an initial €25 million (£21.5 million), making him the most expensive Romanian footballer of all time. Internationally, Drăgușin appeared for Romania under-21 in one match at the 2021 UEFA European Championship. The following year, he made his full debut in a 0–1 friendly loss to Greece.
