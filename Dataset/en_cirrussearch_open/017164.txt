Zeljko Kalac (born 16 December 1972) is an Australian former soccer player who is currently manager of Sydney United 58 in the National Premier Leagues NSW. Standing at 2.02Â m, Kalac is the tallest player to have represented the Australia national football team. Although he was a goalkeeper, Kalac's preferred playing number (when not the conventional number 1) is 18 and has generally worn this number when playing for Australia. However, when he joined Italian club A.C. Milan in 2005, the number 18 was already claimed by Marek Jankulovski, who joined at the same time, and so he chose number 16. When he transferred to Kavala, number 18 was also taken, so he settled for number 60.
