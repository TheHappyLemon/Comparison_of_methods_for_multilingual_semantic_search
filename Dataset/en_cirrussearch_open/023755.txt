Sievierodonetsk (/ˌsɛvərədɒˈnjɛtsk/ SEH-vər-ə-do-N(Y)ETSK; Ukrainian: Сєвєродонецьк, IPA: [ˌsʲɛwʲerodoˈnɛtsʲk] ), also spelled Severodonetsk (Russian: Северодонецк), is a city in Luhansk Oblast, eastern Ukraine. It is located to the northeast of the left bank of the Donets river and approximately 110 km (68 mi) to the northwest from the administrative center of the oblast, Luhansk. Sievierodonetsk faces neighbouring Lysychansk across the river. The city, whose name comes from the above-mentioned river, had a population of 99,067 (2022 estimate), making it then the second-most populous city in the oblast. Since June 2022, it has been militarily occupied and administered by Russia. Prior to the war, Sievierodonetsk had several factories as well as the Azot chemical plant. There was also an airport six kilometres (3.7 mi) to the south of the city. Sievierodonetsk served as the administrative centre of Luhansk Oblast from 2014 to 2022, due to the city of Luhansk falling under the control of pro-Russian separatists at the start of the war in Donbas. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sievierodonetsk came under heavy attack from Russian forces and was the forefront of the battle of Donbas, resulting in extensive destruction to the city, including residential areas. By 25 June 2022, the city was fully captured by Russian and separatist forces, with Ukrainian authorities claiming that the civilian population was approximately 10,000, or ten percent of its pre-war population.
