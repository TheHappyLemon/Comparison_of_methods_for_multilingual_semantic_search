The Japanese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes viverrinus), also known by its Japanese name tanuki (Japanese: 狸, たぬき), is a species of canid endemic to Japan. It is one of two species in the genus Nyctereutes, alongside the common raccoon dog (N. procyonoides), of which it was traditionally thought to be a subspecies (Nyctereutes procyonoides viverrinus). The Japanese raccoon dog has a smaller stomach and shorter fur of lesser insulation value than mainland raccoon dogs. A rare, white colour type can also be found. Within Japanese folklore, Japanese raccoon dogs (tanuki) have had a significant role since ancient times. They are reputed to be mischievous and jolly, masters of disguise and shapeshifting but somewhat gullible and absent-minded. The animals have also been common in Japanese art, particularly as subjects for statues.
