Saulkrasti (pronunciation; German: Neubad) (literally Sun shores in Latvian) is a town in Latvia on the east coast of the Gulf of Riga and the capital of the Saulkrasti municipality. Made up of a number of historic fishing settlements, the town stretches for some 17 km from the Inčupe river in the south to the village of Skulte in the north. The town itself spans across 4.8 square kilometres (1.9 sq mi) and includes an additional 42 square kilometres (16 sq mi) of fields and forests. The center of Saulkrasti is situated about 40 km from Sigulda, 45 km from Riga, 47 km from Limbaži, and 58 km from Salacgrīva. The territory of the Saulkrasti municipality is crossed by the European route E67, known locally as Via Baltica or the A1 road. There are six train stations in Saulkrasti and its suburbs - Inčupe, Pabaži, Saulkrasti, Ķīšupe, Zvejniekciems, and Skulte, the latter being the final stop on the Zemitāni-Skulte Railway line. The coat of arms of Saulkrasti represents the four rivers (white stripes) of Inčupe, Pēterupe, Ķīšupe, and Aģe, and the five villages (green stripes) – Bādciems, Katrīnbāde or Pabaži, Pēterupe, Neibāde, and Zvejniekciems that make up the town. The top parts represent the sea and the sun. A part of the historic Livonian Metsepole land and later known as Neibāde or Neubad, Saulkrasti received its present name in 1933 when the five adjoining villages were merged into one common municipal structure. It received town rights in 1991. Saulkrasti is the home of the annual Saulkrasti Jazz Festival.
