The 2005 NHL Entry Draft was the 43rd NHL Entry Draft. Originally scheduled to be held on June 25, the 2004â€“05 NHL lockout led to the draft being postponed to July 30. Special procedures were required to determine the order of picks, because the previous season had been cancelled due to the lockout. The first overall pick was won in a lottery by the Pittsburgh Penguins, who selected Sidney Crosby. As of 2023, the remaining active players in the NHL from this draft are Sidney Crosby, Anze Kopitar, T. J. Oshie, Kris Letang, James Neal, Andrew Cogliano, Marc-Edouard Vlasic, Jack Johnson, Marc Staal, Ryan Reaves, Jonathan Quick, and Alex Stalock.
