The 1976–77 season of the European Cup football club tournament was won for the first time by Liverpool in the final against Borussia Mönchengladbach. Three-time defending champions Bayern Munich were knocked out by Dynamo Kyiv in the quarter-finals. It was only the second time an English side won the tournament, but it started a run of six consecutive wins by English clubs and an eight-year run during which the trophy was won by English clubs on seven occasions. Including this one, Liverpool reached five finals in nine years, of which they won four.
