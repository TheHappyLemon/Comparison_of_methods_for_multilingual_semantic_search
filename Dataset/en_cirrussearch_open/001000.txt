Mount Erebus (/ˈɛrɪbəs/) is the second-highest volcano in Antarctica (after Mount Sidley), the highest active volcano in Antarctica, and the southernmost active volcano on Earth. It is the sixth-highest highest point of an island, and the second most prominent mountain in Antarctica after Mount Vinson. It has a summit elevation of 3,794 metres (12,448 ft). It is located in the Ross Dependency on Ross Island, which is also home to three inactive volcanoes: Mount Terror, Mount Bird, and Mount Terra Nova.[citation needed] The mountain was named by Captain James Clark Ross in 1841 for his ship, the Erebus. The volcano has been active for around 1.3 million years and has a long-lived lava lake in its inner summit crater that has been present since at least the early 1970s. On 28 November 1979 Air New Zealand Flight 901 crashed on Mount Erebus killing all 257 people on board.
