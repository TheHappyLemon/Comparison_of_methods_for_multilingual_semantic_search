Jaime Víctor Alguersuari Escudero (Spanish: [ˈxajme alɣeɾˈswaɾi]; born 23 March 1990), also known as Jaume Alguersuari (Catalan: [ˈʒawmə əlɣəɾsuˈaɾi]), and Squire is a Spanish DJ and retired racing driver best known for competing in Formula One between 2009 and 2011, and for being the 2008 British Formula 3 champion. He is the son of Jaime Alguersuari, Sr., a former motorcyclist and racing driver. Alguersuari became the youngest Formula One driver to start a Grand Prix in history at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix – at the age of 19 years, 125 days – and in the process, became the first driver to be born in the 1990s to compete in Formula One. This record was broken by Max Verstappen in 2015 who competed at just 17 years of age. After losing his drive with the Toro Rosso team in late 2011, Alguersuari joined British radio station BBC Radio 5 Live to be their expert summariser for the 2012 Formula One season, alongside lead commentator James Allen. At the age of 25, Alguersuari officially retired from motorsport to concentrate on his DJ career.
