The Paris Masters (formerly known as the Paris Open, and currently called the Rolex Paris Masters for sponsorship reasons) is an annual tennis tournament for male professional players held in Paris, France. It is played indoors at the AccorHotels Arena, in the neighborhood of Bercy, and is held in early November. The event is part of the Masters 1000 series on the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Tour. The tournament evolved from the French Covered Court Championships. Beginning with the Open Era, it was held at the Stade Pierre de Coubertin until 1982. In 1989 it was upgraded to the Grand Prix Tour (Grand Prix Super Series). The event is usually the final tournament on the calendar before the season-ending ATP Finals. For sponsorship reasons, the event was officially known from 2003 to 2016 as BNP Paribas Masters, and from 2017 has been called the Rolex Paris Masters. It is also referred to as the Paris Indoor event and as Bercy to distinguish it from the other significant tennis tournanent held in Paris, the French Open, which is held outdoors in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. It is the last of the top nine tournanents to be held indoors. The surface used to be one of the fastest courts in the world which rewarded bold attacking tennis, but since 2011 it has followed the general slow-down of most courts on the tour. Ilie Năstase, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic are the only singles players to have won both Parisian tournaments (Bercy and the French Open). Năstase, Agassi and Djokovic are the only three to win the double in a season, with Djokovic doing so twice. Djokovic is also the most successful singles player in the tournament's history with seven titles, and is the only player to defend the title (2013–2015).
