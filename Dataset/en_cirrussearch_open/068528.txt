The 2023 World Athletics Championships (Hungarian: 2023-as atlétikai világbajnokság), the nineteenth edition of the World Athletics Championships, were held from 19 to 27 August 2023 at the National Athletics Centre, in Budapest, Hungary. The tournament returned to its usual two-year cycle after the previous event in Eugene, Oregon, United States was postponed to 2022, held a little 13 months earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These are the first World Athletics Championships in Hungary. The city of Budapest had previously stated an interest in hosting the 2007 World Championships, but withdrew and it was eventually held in Osaka. The official mascot of the event is a Racka, called Youhuu.
