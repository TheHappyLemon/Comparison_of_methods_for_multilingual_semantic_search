Odise Roshi (born 22 May 1991) is an Albanian professional footballer who plays as a right winger for Turkish club Sakaryaspor and the Albania national team. Roshi started his professional career with his hometown club Apolonia Fier whom he played three years. In 2009, he joined Flamurtari Vlorë where he would become one of the most important players. The 2010–11 season turned out to be his breakthrough season, which earned him a transfer to 1. FC Köln of Bundesliga. Roshi failed to make an impact there, and after one season he left to sign with FSV Frankfurt in the 2. Bundesliga. During his spell at Bornheimer, Roshi made more than 70 league appearances, and in 2015 was sold at HNK Rijeka in Croatia. He left the club after only one season due to limited playing time and signed with Akhmat Grozny of Russian Premier League. Roshi has represented Albania at under-17 and -21 levels before making his senior debut in 2011. Since then he has more than 40 caps to his name, and was part of UEFA Euro 2016 squad.
