AngoSat 1 was a geostationary communications satellite operated by Angosat and built by the Russian company RKK Energia. It was the first communications satellite of Angola, designed for a 15-year mission to deliver television, internet, and radio services to Angola and other territories. The satellite suffered a power problem in its first hours on orbit and lost contact with its ground control. After the power problem was resolved, contact was reestablished with the satellite, but ultimately it did not recover, and contact was permanently lost 3 days into the mission. After repeated failures to establish contact in the following weeks and months, the satellite was declared lost. Russia financed, built and launched a replacement satellite named AngoSat 2.
