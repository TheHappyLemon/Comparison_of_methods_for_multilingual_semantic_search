The 2022–23 Ligue 1, also known as Ligue 1 Uber Eats for sponsorship reasons, was the 85th season of the Ligue 1, France's premier football competition. It began on 5 August 2022 and concluded on 3 June 2023. As the 2022 FIFA World Cup began on 20 November, the last round before the break was held on 12–13 November. The league subsequently resumed on 27 December. Four clubs were relegated to Ligue 2 at the end of the season as the number of clubs was reduced to 18 starting from the 2023–24 season. As a result, no play-offs were held at the end of the season, and this was the last season played with 20 teams. Paris Saint-Germain were the defending champions, and they won a record-breaking eleventh title with one match to spare, following a 1–1 draw against Strasbourg on 27 May.
