The striped hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus semistriatus) is a skunk species from Central and South America (from southern Mexico to northern Peru, and in the extreme east of Brazil). This species of skunk is considered a generalist species, because they are able to thrive in, and withstand, disturbed environmental conditions. They can live in a wide range of habitats, including carrasco, arboreal caatinga, mango orchard, and dry forest scrub and occasionally, in rainforest.
