Forever, Michael is the fourth studio album by American singer Michael Jackson, released by Motown Records on January 16, 1975. The album is credited as having songs with funk and soul material. Eddie Holland, Brian Holland, Hal Davis, Freddie Perren, and Sam Brown III served as producers on Forever, Michael. It is the final album before Jackson's solo breakthrough with his next album, Off the Wall (1979). The album charted only in the United States, hitting number 101 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart and number 10 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart. Forever, Michael failed to chart in other countries. Unlike Jackson's previous studio albums, the album was not commercially successful worldwide. However, Forever, Michael was generally well received by contemporary music critics. As part of promotion for the album, three singles were released from Forever, Michael, all of which were moderate commercial successes on the US Billboard Hot 100 and other music charts worldwide. In 1981, Motown released the compilation album, One Day in Your Life, named after the third track from Forever, Michael. "One Day in Your Life" was released as a single and reached number one in the UK and several other countries. Songs from the album were reissued in 2009 after Jackson's death in June of the same year as part of the 3-disc compilation album Hello World: The Motown Solo Collection.
