Sam Loyd, London Era, 1861 "Excelsior" is one of Sam Loyd's most famous chess problems, originally published in London Era in 1861. In 1867, it participated together with five other problems as a set in an international problem tournament. The motto for the full set was "Excelsior" (eng. 'Ever upward'), generally known as the title of the poem "Excelsior" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and as that term is very fitting for this particular problem, it is generally associated with it. It is not to be confused by a popular 1958 study of the same name by Russian chess composer Vladimir Korolkov, which has a similar thematic motif. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
