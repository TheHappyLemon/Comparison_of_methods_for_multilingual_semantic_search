The International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) is the governing body of the Olympic shooting events. It also regulates several non-Olympic shooting sport events. The Federation's activities include regulation of the sport, managing Olympic qualification events and quota places, as well as organization of international competitions such as the ISSF World Cup series and ISSF World Championships. The ISSF was founded in 1907 as the International Shooting Union (ISU, French: Union Internationale de Tir (UIT)), changing its name in 1998. The Federation affiliates more than 150 National Shooting Federations from around the world. The ISSF headquarters is in Munich, Germany. Since 2022, the ISSF Presidency has been held by Luciano RossiÂ [it], a former Italian Senator and head of the Italian Clay Pigeon Federation (FITAV). After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the ISSF banned Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from its competitions. In March 2023, the new president Luciano Rossi of Italy expressed his desire to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes so they can compete at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.
