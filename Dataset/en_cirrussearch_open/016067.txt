"Stray Heart" is a song by American rock band Green Day. It is the seventh track on their tenth studio album, ¡Dos! (2012), and was released as the only single from the album in Europe and Australia on October 15, 2012. It is also the fourth single from the ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! & ¡Tré! trilogy. The song is swapped on the vinyl version of ¡Dos! with the song "Drama Queen" from ¡Tré!, due to the records being printed before the switch, meaning "Drama Queen" appears on both ¡Dos! and ¡Tré!, and that "Stray Heart" never saw a release on vinyl. The single was certified gold by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry for downloads exceeding 15,000 units in Italy.
