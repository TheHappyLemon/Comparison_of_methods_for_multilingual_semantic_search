The Greatest Showman is a 2017 American fictionalized biographical musical drama film directed by Michael Gracey (in his directorial debut) from a screenplay written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon, and a story by Bicks. The film stars an ensemble cast led by Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson, and Zendaya. Featuring nine original songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and a score composed by John Debney and Joseph Trapanese, the film is a fictional depiction of the life of P. T. Barnum, a showman and entertainer, and his creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus and the lives of its star attractions. Principal photography began in New York City in November 2016. The film premiered on December 8, 2017, aboard RMS Queen Mary 2. It was released in the United States on December 20, 2017, by 20th Century Fox, seven months after Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus ceased operations. The film grossed $435 million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing live-action musical film of all time. The film was praised for the performances, music, visuals, and production values, but was criticised for its artistic license. It has, however, developed a cult following through its message of empowerment and sense of escapism, in part thanks to the success of its soundtrack. It received nominations for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actor – Musical or Comedy for Jackman at the 75th Golden Globe Awards. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for the song "This Is Me", which was also nominated for Best Original Song at the 90th Academy Awards and won the Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.
