Template:Attached KML/Podgorica–Shkodër railway KML is from Wikidata The Podgorica–Shkodër railway is a railway connecting Albania and Montenegro, used for freight-purposes only. It is Albania's only international rail link. Although initially built between 1984 and 1985, it fell into disuse in 1991 and later fully reopened in 2003. The rail infrastructure is operated by Montenegrin ŽICG on Montenegrin territory and Hekurudha Shqiptare (Albanian Railways) on Albanian territory. Nevertheless, train services are usually operated by Montenegrin operator ŽPCG between Podgorica and the Albanian Bajzë station and by Hekurudha Shqiptare between Bajzë and Shkodër only. The line connects to Belgrade–Bar railway and Nikšić–Podgorica railway in Podgorica and Shkodër–Vorë railway in Shkodër.
