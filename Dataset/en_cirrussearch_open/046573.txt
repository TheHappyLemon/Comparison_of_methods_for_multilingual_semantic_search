The phrase per mille (from Latin per mīlle 'in each thousand') indicates parts per thousand. The associated symbol is ‰, similar to a per cent sign % but with an extra zero in the divisor. Major dictionaries do not agree on the spelling, giving other options of per mil, per mill, permil, permill, permille. The word promille is the cognate in Dutch, German, Finnish and Swedish, and is sometimes seen as a loanword in English with the same meaning as per mille.
