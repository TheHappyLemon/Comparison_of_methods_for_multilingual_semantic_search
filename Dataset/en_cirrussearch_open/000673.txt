"Ich tu dir weh" (German for "I'm hurting you") is a song by the German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein. It was the second single released from their sixth studio album, Liebe ist für alle da (2009), on 5 February 2010. A music video for the song had previously been released online on 21 December 2009. The song contains controversial lyrics surrounding sadomasochism. Because of this, Liebe ist für alle da was placed on the "index" maintained by the German BPjM, leading to a forced censored re-release of the album. In May 2010, the original uncensored album and the single were de-indexed and consequently released in Germany.
