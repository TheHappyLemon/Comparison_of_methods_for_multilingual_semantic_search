Luge at the 2014 Winter Olympics was held at the Sliding Center Sanki near Krasnaya Polyana, Russia. The four events were scheduled for 8â€“13 February 2014. In April 2011 the International Olympic Committee approved the addition of the mixed team relay event (one sled from each of the other three events compete per country), meaning luge will have four events on the program for the first time. In December 2017, IOC concluded that two Russian lugers Albert Demchenko and Tatiana Ivanova had committed an anti-doping violation and stripped Russia of 2 silver medals. In January 2018, both athletes successfully appealed against the IOC decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport and both medals were returned to Russia.
