Zuzanna Irena Grabowska (née Jurczak; born 2 September 1997), known professionally as sanah (stylized in all lowercase), is a Polish singer, songwriter, violinist, and composer. She received nationwide popularity in 2020, with the release of her single "Szampan", which became a number one hit in Poland. She later released her debut studio album Królowa dram (2020), which peaked at number one in Poland. She has gone on to release three further studio albums: Irenka (2021), Uczta (2022), and Sanah śpiewa poezyje (2022), all of which peaked at number one in Poland, and were certified diamond by the Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry. The stage name "sanah" was created by shortening the English version of the singer's first name, Susannah. She previously performed under the pseudonym "Ayreen", which was derived from her middle name.
