The 2032 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXXV Olympiad and also known as Brisbane 2032 is an upcoming international multi-sport event scheduled to take place between 23 July to 8 August 2032, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Following changes in the bidding rules, the International Olympic Committee selected and announced Brisbane as the winning bid on 21 July 2021, two days before the start of the 2020 Summer Olympics. Brisbane was first announced as the preferred bid on 24 February 2021, gaining the formal approval of the IOC Executive Board on 10 June 2021. Brisbane became the first host city to be selected to host the Olympics through the new bid process. It will be the third Summer Games to be held in Australia after the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Victoria and the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, New South Wales. It will also be the fourth Summer Games to be held in the Southern Hemisphere, after the aforementioned games in Australia and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, Brazil. This will also be the second Summer Games to be held entirely in a host country's meteorological winter, after Rio.
