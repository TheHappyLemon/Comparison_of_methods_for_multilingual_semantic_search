This article contains Lao text. Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of Lao script. Lao (Lao: ພາສາລາວ, [pʰáː sǎː láːw]), sometimes referred to as Laotian, is the official language of Laos and a significant language in the Isan region of northeastern Thailand, where it is usually referred to as the Isan language. Spoken by over 3 million people in Laos and 3.2 million in all countries, it serves as a vital link in the cultural and social fabric of these areas. It is written in the Lao script, an abugida that evolved from ancient Tai scripts. Lao is a tonal language, where the pitch or tone of a word can alter its meaning, and is analytic, forming sentences through the combination of individual words without inflection. These features, common in Kra-Dai languages, also bear similarities to Sino-Tibetan languages like Chinese or Austroasiatic languages like Vietnamese. Lao's mutual intelligibility with Thai and Isan, fellow Southwestern Tai languages, allows for effective intercommunication among their speakers, despite differences in script and regional variations. In Laos, Lao is not only the official language but also a lingua franca, bridging the linguistic diversity of a population that speaks many other languages. Its cultural significance is reflected in Laotian literature, media, and traditional arts. The Vientiane dialect has emerged as the de facto standard, though no official standard has been established. Internationally, Lao is spoken among diaspora communities, especially in countries like the United States, France, and Australia, reflecting its global diasporic presence.
