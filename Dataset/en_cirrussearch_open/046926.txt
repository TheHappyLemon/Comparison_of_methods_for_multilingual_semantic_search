It participated in the Scottish Football League in the 1930s and 1940s, but went out of business in the 1950s. The present club adopted the Edinburgh City name in 1986. It applied to join the Scottish Football League in 2002 and 2008, but failed to win election. Edinburgh City became members of the new Lowland League in 2013. The club won the Lowland League championship in 2015 and 2016 and won promotion to the Scottish Professional Football League in 2016. In 2022, Edinburgh City were promoted to reach Scottish League One for the first time in club’s history after winning 3–2 in the play-off final against Annan Athletic. Following this promotion, on 16 June 2022 the club rebranded, changing its name from Edinburgh City Football Club to Football Club of Edinburgh and unveiling a new badge. Following the sale of the football club to John Dickson in 2023, the club successfully applied to the Scottish Football Association to return to the Edinburgh City name.
