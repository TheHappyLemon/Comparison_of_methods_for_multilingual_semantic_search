Filippo Paulucci delle Roncole (11 September 1779 – 25 January 1849), also known as Filipp Osipovich Pauluchchi (Russian: Филипп Осипович Паулуччи), was an Italian marquis and army officer, later a general at the services of the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of Italy, and the Russian Empire. Born into a prominent Modenese noble family, he served as a junior officer in the Sardinian Army during the War of the First Coalition (1794–96). After brief services in the Cisalpine Republic and Austrian armies in Italy, in 1806 he moved into Russian service and climb the ranks to the position of governor general of Livonia. In 1829 he returned in Piedmont and was appointed full general and Inspector general of Infantry and Cavalry on 1830, only to be dismissed a year later when King Carlo Felice died. In 1848 Paulucci was rumored as a possible Commander-in-Chief for the Sardinian Army, but he refused any involvements. He died peacefully in Nice the following year.
