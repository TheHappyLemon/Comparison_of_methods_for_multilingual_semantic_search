Her best World Cup finish is 2nd place in slalom. Popović's first major competition was the 2015 World Championships in Beaver Creek, USA, where she competed in all disciplines at age seventeen; her best result was 27th in slalom. By her 22nd birthday, she had incurred three surgeries on her left leg.
