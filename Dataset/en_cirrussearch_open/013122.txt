Sega Superstars Tennis is a sports video game developed by Sumo Digital and published by Sega. It is the second title in the Sega All-Stars series, preceded by Sega Superstars (2004), and crosses over characters, locations, and soundtracks from several Sega franchises, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Space Channel 5, and Super Monkey Ball. The game was originally released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and Wii, followed by releases for Mac OS X and multiple mobile versions. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews from critics, with reviewers praising the game's Sega-theming and variety of content but criticizing the core gameplay. The game was followed up by two racing game entries, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (2010) and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (2012).
