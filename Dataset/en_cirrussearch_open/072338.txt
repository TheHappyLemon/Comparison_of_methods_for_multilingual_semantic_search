This article shows a list of cities in Denmark by population. The population is measured by Statistics Denmark for urban areas (Danish: Byområder), defined as a contiguous built-up area with a maximum distance of 200 meters between houses, unless further distance is caused by public areas, cemeteries or similar. Furthermore, to obtain the status of being a city (byområde), the area must have at least 200 inhabitants. Smaller settlements are by Danmarks Statistik included in numbers for rural areas (landdistrikter).[failed verification]
