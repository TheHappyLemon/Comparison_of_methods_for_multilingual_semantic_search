Mohawkite is a rare rock consisting of mixtures of arsenic, silver, nickel, skutterudite and copper, with the formula Cu3As up to Cu6As, and the most desirable material was usually found in white quartz matrix. It has a hardness of 3â€“3.5 and a metallic luster. It is named after the Mohawk Mine, where it was originally found. Colors range from brassy-yellow to metallic gray, and sometimes will have a blue or greenish surface tarnish. These colors come from its two main ingredients, the arsenic-rich copper minerals algodonite and domeykite. Its color may resemble pyrrhotite, but unlike pyrrhotite, mohawkite is not magnetic.
