.sh is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, although it is primarily used in Saint Helena (Ascension Island has its own ccTLD, .ac). Registrations of internationalized domain names are also accepted. On 22 February 2010 the ISO 3166-1 code for Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha changed to reflect the SH used for the ccTLD.
