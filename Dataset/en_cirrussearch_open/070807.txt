Lamitan, officially the City of Lamitan (Chavacano: Ciudad de Lamitan; Yakan: Siyudad Lamitanin; Tausūg: Dāira sin Lamitan; Filipino: Lungsod ng Lamitan), is a 6th class component city and de jure capital of the province of Basilan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 100,150 people. The city is bounded on the east by the municipality of Tuburan, on the south by Tipo-Tipo, on the west by Isabela and on the north by Basilan Strait. In July 2016, the Basilan provincial government broke ground for the construction of the new provincial capitol inside the defunct 4,000-hectare (9,900-acre) University of the Philippines (UP) Land Grant in Barangay Santa Clara. In July 2022, Lamitan gained national attention when former mayor Rose Furigay, who had served as the city's mayor from 2013 to June 2022, was assassinated in a mass shooting at the Ateneo de Manila University where two others were killed.
