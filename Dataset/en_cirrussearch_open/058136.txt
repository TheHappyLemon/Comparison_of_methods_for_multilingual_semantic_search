The 2021 Milan–San Remo (known as Milano–Sanremo presented by EOLO for sponsorship reasons) was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 20 March 2021 in northwestern Italy. It was the 112th edition of the Milan–San Remo cycling classic. Originally the eighth event on the 2021 UCI World Tour calendar, it became the sixth event after the cancellation of the Tour Down Under and the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. After the COVID-19 pandemic forced several alterations to the 2020 edition, the race returned both to its usual mid-March slot and to a more traditional route. The 299-kilometre (186 mi) long race in northwestern Italy started from the Lombardian capital of Milan. The course featured several hills, the last of which was the Poggio di San Remo in the final 10 kilometres (6.2 mi), before a flat finish on the Via Roma in Sanremo on the Mediterranean coast of Liguria. As the peloton approached the summit of the Poggio, several attacks resulted in a select group being formed that contained many of the pre-race favourites, including the main three of defending champion Wout van Aert (Team Jumbo–Visma), 2019 winner Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck–Quick-Step), and Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin–Fenix). In the final three kilometres, Jasper Stuyven (Trek–Segafredo) launched a late attack at the bottom of the descent of the Poggio and held off the rest of the favourites to win his first monument and become the second consecutive Belgian winner of the race. Caleb Ewan (Lotto–Soudal) won the bunch sprint for second ahead of van Aert in third.
