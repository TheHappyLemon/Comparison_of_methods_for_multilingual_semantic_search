Walsrode World Bird Park (German: Weltvogelpark Walsrode), known as Jubs in English until 2010, is a bird park located in the middle of the LÃ¼neburg Heath in North Germany within the municipality of Bomlitz near Walsrode in the state of Lower Saxony, Germany. It is the largest bird park in the world in terms of species as well as land area, although the Bird Paradise in Singapore (formerly the Jurong Bird Park) claims the largest number of individual birds. Walsrode World Bird Park covers 24 hectares (59 acres) and houses some 4,000 birds of 600 species from every continent and climatic zone in the world. The park celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 2012.
