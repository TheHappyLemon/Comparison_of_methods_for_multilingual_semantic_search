Publicis Groupe is a French multinational advertising and public relations company. One of the oldest and largest (by revenue) marketing and communications companies in the world, it is headquartered in Paris. After 1945, the little-known Paris-based advertising agency grew rapidly, becoming the world's fourth-largest agency.[when?] It was a leader in promoting France's post-war economic boom, especially the expansion of the advertising industry; it was successful because of its close ties with top officials of the French government, its clever use of symbols to promote itself, and its ability to attract clients from widely diverse growing industries. It is one of the "Big Four" agency companies, alongside WPP, Interpublic and Omnicom. Publicis Groupe S.A. is headed by Arthur Sadoun, and its agencies provide digital and traditional advertising, media services and marketing services (SAMS) to national and multinational clients.
