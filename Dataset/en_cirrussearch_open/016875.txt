The 1951 FIBA European Championship, commonly called FIBA EuroBasket 1951, was the seventh FIBA EuroBasket regional basketball championship, held by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). Eighteen national teams affiliated with FIBA entered the competition, a record number and more than twice the number that had competed two years earlier. The competition was hosted by France, who had taken second place at EuroBasket 1949, behind 1949 hosts Egypt. The VÃ©lodrome d'hiver, Paris was the location of the event. 73 matches were held over the course of the tournament, including the three walkovers caused by Romania withdrawing after the competition schedule had been set.
