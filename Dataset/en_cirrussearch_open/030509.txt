The term "thermal energy" is used loosely in various contexts in physics and engineering, generally related to the kinetic energy of vibrating and colliding atoms in a substance. It can refer to several different physical concepts. These include the internal energy or enthalpy of a body of matter and radiation; heat, defined as a type of energy transfer (as is thermodynamic work); and the characteristic energy of a degree of freedom, kBT{\displaystyle k_{\mathrm {B} }T}, in a system that is described in terms of its microscopic particulate constituents (where T{\displaystyle T} denotes temperature and kB{\displaystyle k_{\mathrm {B} }} denotes the Boltzmann constant).
