Vacansoleilâ€“DCM Pro Cycling Team was a Dutch professional road race cycling team. They were a UCI ProTeam and competed in the UCI World Tour. The team was established in 2005, as the successor of P3 Transfer-Batavus, while also taking over many of the riders and staff of Cycle Collstrop, the former team of manager Van der Schueren. Neither Vacansoleil or DCM renewed their sponsorship of the program after the 2013 season.
