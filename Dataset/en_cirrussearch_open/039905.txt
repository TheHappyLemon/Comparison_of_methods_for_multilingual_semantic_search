Lietuvēns or lietonis (in Latgale also can be called “lītūņš”, similar to Slavic mara (Russian: Мара) or Lithuanian “lauma”) is a mythological creature in Latvian folklore. According to Latvian folk epics and omens, lietuvēns is the soul of a murdered (strangled, drowned or hanged) person cursed to live in this world as long as it has been meant to live. By some beliefs, it is the soul of an unbaptized child. It attacks both people and domestic animals. Sleep paralysis is thought to be torture or strangling by a lietuvēns. When under attack, one must move the toe of the left foot to get rid of the attacker. It is also said that lietuvēns is able to penetrate into houses, even through keyholes and, aside from nightmares, can strangle the victim.
