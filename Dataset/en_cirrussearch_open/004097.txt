The Zunda Towers (formerly known as the Z-Towers) are a pair of skyscrapers in Riga, Latvia. The buildings were designed by Latvian architectural firm F.L.Tadao & Lukševics, while the façade was designed by architect Helmut Jahn. Both towers have a mix of office space and residential units. The total cost of the project was more than €250 million. The towers were completed in 2017, and opened a few years later.
