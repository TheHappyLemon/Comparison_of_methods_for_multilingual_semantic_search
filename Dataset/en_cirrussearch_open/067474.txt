Saldus (pronunciation; German: Frauenburg) is a Latvian town located in Courland (Latvian: Kurzeme) region of Latvia, and the largest town in Saldus Municipality. The name Saldus has been noted in historical sources as far back as the mid-13th century, but the founding year for the establishment of the town is considered to be 1856, with the settlement gaining town rights in 1917. The town is located in between Riga and Liepāja (slightly closer to Liepāja (100 km) than Riga (119 km). The Ciecere River flows through Saldus, and it is a tributary to one of Latvia’s biggest rivers, the Venta. The city is often referred to as "the Bowl of Courland" because of a famous quote by Māris Čaklais: "A drop of honey in the bowl of Courland". The reasoning behind the quote is the fact that from a high point, the city looks like a crater. As of January 2019, Saldus is the 17th-largest city in Latvia according to population data. In 2019, the town had a population of 9,937.
