Nervonic acid (24:1, n−9) is a fatty acid. It is a monounsaturated analog of lignoceric acid (24:0). It is also known as selacholeic acid and cis-15-tetracosenoic acid. Its name derives from the Latin word nervus, meaning nerve or sinew. It exists in nature as an elongation product of oleic acid (18:1 Δ9). Its immediate precursor is erucic acid. Nervonic acid is particularly abundant in the white matter of animal brains and in peripheral nervous tissue where nervonyl sphingolipids are enriched in the myelin sheath of nerve fibers. This acid is among the group of cerebrosides, which are fatty acids of the glycosphingolipids group, which are components of muscles and the nervous system, accounting for approximately 40% of the total fatty acids in sphingolipids.
