Myrnohrad (Ukrainian: Мирногра́д, pronounced [mɪrnoˈɦrɑd]; Russian: Мирноград, romanized: Mirnograd), formerly Dymytrov (Ukrainian: Димитров, Russian: Димитров, romanized: Dimitrov), is a city of oblast significance in Donetsk Oblast (province) of Ukraine. Population: 46,098 (2022 estimate). The city was previously named after Georgi Dimitrov (Bulgarian: Георги Димитров) - a prominent Bulgarian and Soviet communist politician, but was renamed to Myrnohrad during decommunisation in May 2016. Unlike in most bigger cities in Donetsk Oblast, the separatist Donetsk People's Republic 11 May 2014 referendum on independence was not held in the city.
