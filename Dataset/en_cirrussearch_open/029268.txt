Latvia and the other Baltic states, together with the Nordic countries have signed a memorandum of understanding on the posting of diplomats at each other's missions abroad, under the auspices of Nordic-Baltic Eight. Honorary consulates and overseas offices of the Investment and Development Agency of Latvia are excluded from this listing.
