The men's ISSF 50 meter pistol event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on August 12 at the Beijing Shooting Range Hall. There were 45 competitors from 32 nations. The event was won by Jin Jong-oh of South Korea, the first of his three consecutive victories in the free pistol. It was his second medal, after taking silver in 2004; he was the 10th man to win multiple medals in the event (he would later become the fourth to win three and second to win four). Kim Jong-su of North Korea originally won the silver medal, but was disqualified after he tested positive for propranolol. This moved Tan Zongliang of China from bronze to silver and gave Vladimir Isakov of Russia the bronze. It was China's first medal in the event since 1992; Russia was on the free pistol podium for the third time in four Games.
