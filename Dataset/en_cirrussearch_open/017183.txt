Obeliai (pronunciation; Polish: Abele, Yiddish: אבעל Abel) is a small city in the Rokiškis district municipality of Panevėžys County, Lithuania. At the foot of the town is one of the area's many lakes. The town of Obeliai is small and quite poor, due in no small part to the diversion of the railway; the station remains but is no longer in use.
