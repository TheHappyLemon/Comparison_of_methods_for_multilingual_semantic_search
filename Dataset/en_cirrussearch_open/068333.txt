The species Galega officinalis and Galega orientalis are familiar in cultivation. Numerous cultivars and garden hybrids have also been produced, of which G. × hartlandii 'Lady Wilson' (bicoloured blue and white) and the white-flowered G. × hartlandii 'Alba' have both gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
