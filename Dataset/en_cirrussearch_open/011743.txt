A lynx (/lɪŋks/ links; pl.: lynx or lynxes) is any of the four extant species (the Canada lynx, Iberian lynx, Eurasian lynx and the bobcat) within the medium-sized wild cat genus Lynx. The name originated in Middle English via Latin from the Greek word lynx (λύγξ), derived from the Indo-European root leuk- ("light", "brightness"), in reference to the luminescence of its reflective eyes.
