Scott Pilgrim Takes Off is an anime television series developed by Bryan Lee O'Malley and BenDavid Grabinski for Netflix. The series is based on the Scott Pilgrim graphic novels written and drawn by O'Malley, with the entire main cast from the 2010 film adaptation, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, reprising their roles for the English voice cast. The series was released on November 17, 2023, to critical acclaim. Unlike the film, which is a largely faithful adaptation of the comics, Takes Off features a different plot, wherein the titular Scott Pilgrim disappears in the first episode; the remainder of the series follows his love interest Ramona Flowers as she tries to find out who was responsible for his disappearance, all whilst other characters within the story work on a fictional adaptation of Scott's life.
