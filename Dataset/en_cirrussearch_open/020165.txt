Expressway S1 or express road S1 is a Polish highway under construction with a planned length of 130 km (81 mi), in the Silesian and Lesser Poland voivodeships. Upon completion, it will connect the A1 motorway near the Katowice International Airport in Pyrzowice, with the border of Slovakia in Zwardoń, where it will connect to the D3 Motorway. A major part of the route is the Eastern beltway of the Upper Silesian Industrial Region between the A1 and A4 motorway. The S1 originally was routed from Bielsko-Biała via Cieszyn to the Czech border. This section was renumbered to Expressway S52 in 2016 and the S1 was rerouted over the former Expressway S69. The route is expected to be completed by 2025.
