Lusail (Arabic: لوسيل, ALA-LC: Lūsayl, Arabic pronunciation: [luːˈsajl]) is the second-largest city in Qatar after Doha, and the economic capital of Qatar, located on the coast, in the southern part of the municipality of Al Daayen. Lusail lies about 23 kilometres (14 mi) north of the city centre of Doha, just north of the West Bay Lagoon, on over 38 square kilometres (15 sq mi) and will eventually have the infrastructure to accommodate 450,000 people. Of these 450,000 people, it is estimated that 250,000 or fewer will be residents, 190,000 will be office workers and 60,000 retail workers. It is planned to have marinas, residential areas, island resorts, commercial districts, luxury shopping and leisure facilities, and a golf course community, man made islands and several entertainment districts. Construction is still ongoing. Development is being carried out by the state-controlled developer Qatari Diar along with Parsons Corporation and Dorsch-Gruppe. The Lusail Stadium was one of the venues for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and was the venue of the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final. It is also the site of a Formula One race track where the first Qatar Grand Prix was held in 2021.
