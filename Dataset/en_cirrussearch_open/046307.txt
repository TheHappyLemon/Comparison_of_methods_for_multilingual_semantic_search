A sovereign state is a state that has the highest authority over a territory. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, a government not under another, and the capacity to interact with other states. It is commonly understood that a sovereign state is independent. A sovereign state can exist without being recognized by other sovereign states such as Northern Cyprus.Unrecognized states often have difficulty engaging in diplomatic relations with other sovereign states due to their lack of international recognition. When referring to a specific polity, the term "country" may also refer to a constituent country, or a dependent territory.
