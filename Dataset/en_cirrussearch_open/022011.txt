In December 2013, two separate suicide bombings a day apart targeted mass transportation in the city of Volgograd, in the Volgograd Oblast of Southern Russia, killing 34 people overall,[citation needed] including both perpetrators. The attacks followed a bus bombing carried out in the same city two months earlier.
