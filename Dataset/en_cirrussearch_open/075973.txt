This is a list of towns and cities in Norway. The Norwegian language word by means a town or cityâ€“there is no distinction between the two words as there is in English. Historically, the designation of town/city was granted by the King, but since 1996 that authority was given to the local municipal councils for each municipality in Norway. In Norway today, towns/cities have no legal authority or powers and they are not an administrative body, it is simply a designation. All local government rests with the municipality which may or may not have a town/city located within it.
