Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Latvia have expanded substantially in recent years, although LGBT people still face various challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both male and female types of same-sex sexual activity are legal in Latvia, but households headed by same-sex couples are ineligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples. Since May 2022, same-sex couples have been recognized as "family" by the Administrative District Court, which gives them some of the legal protections available to married (opposite-sex) couples; as of 2023 November, around 40 couples have been registered via this procedure. Nevertheless, same-sex couples are unable to marry or jointly adopt, and registering civil partnerships without court litigation remains impossible. The democratization process in Latvia has allowed lesbians and gays to establish organizations and infrastructural elements such as bars, clubs, stores, libraries, etc. Cultural, educational and other events can be held. However LGBT people in Latvia continue to face widespread discrimination in society.[clarification needed] In November 2014, Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs came out via Twitter, becoming the first openly LGBT elected official in the country. In 2023, ILGA-Europe ranked Latvia 24 out of 27 European Union countries for the protection of LGBT rights. Latvia is the only Baltic country and Northern European country which does not fully ban all anti-gay discrimination.
