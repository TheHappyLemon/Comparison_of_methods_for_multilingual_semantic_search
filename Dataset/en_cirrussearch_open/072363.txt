Zaķusala (English: 'Hare Island') is one of several islands in the Daugava river in the central part of Riga, the capital of Latvia. A part of the city's Salas neighbourhood, Zaķusala is home to the Riga Radio and TV Tower, which was completed in 1986 and the Latvian Television building, also completed the same year. The tower is the tallest structure in the Baltic states. On the northern tip of the island, alongside the railway trestles are remnants of the Iron Bridge that was blown up during the Second World War. In maps of the city of Riga in the start of the 20th century, the island is usually referred by the name "Hasenholm". This name is also used in the story of Amfian Gerasimov, a righteous among the nations that saved a Jewish family that live on this island
