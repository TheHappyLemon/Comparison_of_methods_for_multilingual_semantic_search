The diving competitions at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro took place from 7 to 20 August at Maria Lenk Aquatic Center in Barra da Tijuca. It was one of four aquatic sports at the Games, along with swimming, water polo, and synchronised swimming. The 2016 Games featured competitions in eight events (men and women events each of): 3m springboard, synchronised 3m springboard, 10m platform, and synchronised 10m platform. The diving competitions featured up to 136 athletes. All divers had to be at least 14 years old on or by 31 December 2016. On Tuesday August 9, the water of the diving well turned dark green, originally thought to be caused by the heat and lack of wind in the venue. However, at the time a CNN photographer took a picture, an adjacent pool in the same location was not green. Olympic officials later confirmed that the change in color was due to 160 litres of hydrogen peroxide having been mistakenly added to the pool during cleaning. For the eighth consecutive Games, China dominated the medal table, and for the fourth occasion in that period were denied a clean sweep of diving golds by a single event; in this case, the 3 metre synchronised men's event won by Great Britain's Jack Laugher and Chris Mears, their nation's first ever gold medalists in the discipline.
