Boyd Strait is the 40-kilometre (25Â mi) wide strait lying between Snow Island and Smith Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, and linking Drake Passage and the Bransfield Strait. The strait was named in 1823 by a British expedition under James Weddell for Captain David Boyd, Royal Navy.
