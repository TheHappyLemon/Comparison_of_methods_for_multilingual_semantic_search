The Eye of Providence (or the all-seeing eye) is a symbol depicting an eye, often enclosed in a triangle and surrounded by a ray of light or a halo, intended to represent Providence, as the eye watches over the workers of mankind. A well-known example of the Eye of Providence appears on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States, which is depicted on the United States one-dollar bill.
