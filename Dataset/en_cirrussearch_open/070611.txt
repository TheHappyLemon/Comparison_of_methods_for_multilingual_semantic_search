The Rio Grande de Mindanao, also known as the Mindanao River, is the second-largest river system in the Philippines. Located on the southern island of Mindanao, with a total drainage area of 23,169 km2 (8,946 sq mi), draining the majority of the central and eastern portion of the island, and a total length of approximately 373 km (232 mi). It is an important transportation artery, used mainly in transporting agricultural products and, formerly, timber. Its headwaters are in the mountains of Impasugong, Bukidnon, south of Gingoog in Misamis Oriental, where it is called the Pulangi River. Joining the Kabacan River, it becomes the Mindanao River. Flowing out of the mountains, it forms the center of a broad, fertile plain in the southcentral portion of the island. Before its mouth in Illana Bay, it splits into two parallel sections, the Cotabato and Tamontaka, separated by a 180 m (590 ft) hill. Population centers along the river include Cotabato City, Datu Piang and Midsayap.
