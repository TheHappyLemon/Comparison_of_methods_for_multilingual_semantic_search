Four-time defending champion Rafael Nadal defeated Novak Djokovic in the final, 3–6, 7–5, 6–2, 6–4 to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2014 French Open. It was his record-extending ninth French Open title and his 14th major title overall, tying Pete Sampras in second place for the most men's singles major titles in history. Nadal became the first man to win nine titles at the same major and the first man to win the French Open five consecutive times. Roger Federer was trying to become the first man in the Open Era to achieve a double career Grand Slam, but he lost to Ernests Gulbis in the fourth round. This marked Federer's first loss prior to the quarterfinals at the French Open since 2004. Nadal and Djokovic were in contention for the world No. 1 ranking. Nadal retained the top position by defeating Djokovic in the final. This was the sixth time the duo met at the French Open, with Nadal claiming all six wins thus far. This was the last major tournament for former world No. 3 and Tour Finals champion Nikolay Davydenko.
