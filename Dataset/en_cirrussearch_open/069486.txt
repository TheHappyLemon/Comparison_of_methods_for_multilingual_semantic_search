A leg is a weight-bearing and locomotive anatomical structure, usually having a columnar shape. During locomotion, legs function as "extensible struts". The combination of movements at all joints can be modeled as a single, linear element capable of changing length and rotating about an omnidirectional "hip" joint. As an anatomical animal structure, it is used for locomotion. The distal end is often modified to distribute force (such as a foot). Most animals have an even number of legs. As a component of furniture, it is used for the economy of materials needed to provide the support for the useful surface, such as the table top or chair seat.
