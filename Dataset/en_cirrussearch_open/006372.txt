The satellite was produced by ISS Reshetnev, and has a mass of around 1,400 kilograms (3,100 lb). It was intended to operate in a circular orbit at an altitude of around 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) above the Earth's surface; however, it was placed into a lower than planned orbit after its launch failed. A second Geo-IK-2 satellite was successfully launched on June 4, 2016, as Kosmos 2517.
