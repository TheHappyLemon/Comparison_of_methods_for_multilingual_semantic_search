The Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay is the Academy Award (also known as an Oscar) for the best screenplay adapted from previously established material. The most frequently adapted media are novels, but other adapted narrative formats include stage plays, musicals, short stories, TV series, and even other films and film characters. All sequels are also considered adaptations by this standard (based on the story and characters set forth in the original film). Prior to its current name, this award had been known as the Academy Award for Best Screenplay Based On Material From Another Medium. The Best Adapted Screenplay category has been a part of the awards ceremony since the beginning. See also the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, the corresponding award for scripts with original stories.
