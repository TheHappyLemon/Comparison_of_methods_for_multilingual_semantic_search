The Dominican Republic national football team (Spanish: Selección de fútbol de República Dominicana) represents the Dominican Republic in men's international football, and is governed by the Dominican Football Federation. The team is a member of the Caribbean Football Union of CONCACAF, the governing body of football in North and Central America and the Caribbean. As of 26 October 2023, the Dominican Republic is currently ranked 149th in the FIFA World Rankings. As is the case in many other Caribbean nations, association football has not traditionally been the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic. Interest in baseball diverts away from football and contributes to the country's lack of success in any major football tournament qualification. As of 2022, the Dominican Republic has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, nor the CONCACAF Gold Cup. In spite of this, the country's youth football team has enjoyed recent success, qualifying for both the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2024 Olympic football tournaments.
