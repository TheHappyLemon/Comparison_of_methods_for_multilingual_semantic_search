.cz is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Czech Republic. It is administered by CZ.NIC. Registrations must be ordered via accredited domain name registrars. Until Czechoslovakia was dissolved in 1993, it used the domain .cs. The maximum domain name length permitted is 63 characters, which may only be alphanumeric or the hyphen (-). Hyphens are restricted in that they may not be the first or last character, neither may they appear consecutively. As of 2013, there are six domains which use the maximum of 63 characters.
