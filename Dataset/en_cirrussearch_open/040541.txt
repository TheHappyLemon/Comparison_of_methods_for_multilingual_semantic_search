The Liga I (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈliɡa ɨnˈtɨj]; First League), also spelled as Liga 1, is a Romanian professional league for men's association football clubs. Currently sponsored by betting company Superbet, it is officially known as the SuperLiga. It is the country's top football competition, being contested by 16 clubs which take part in a promotion and relegation system with the Liga II. The teams play 30 matches each in the regular season, before entering the championship play-offs or the relegation play-outs according to their position in the regular table. The Liga I was established in 1909 and commenced play for the 1909–10 campaign, being currently 25th in UEFA's league coefficient ranking list. It is administered by the Liga Profesionistă de Fotbal, also known by the acronym LPF. Before the 2006–07 season, the competition was known as Divizia A, but the name had to be changed following the finding that someone else had registered that trademark. The best performer to date is Steaua București with 20 titles, followed by longtime cross-town rival Dinamo București with 18 trophies. Furthermore, of the remaining 21 clubs which came victorious in the competition, eight have won it on at least three occasions—CFR Cluj (eight trophies), Venus București (seven), Chinezul Timișoara and UTA Arad (six each), Ripensia Timișoara, Universitatea Craiova and Petrolul Ploiești (four each), and Rapid București (three).
