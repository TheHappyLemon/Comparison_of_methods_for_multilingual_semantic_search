Agaricus bernardii, commonly called the salt-loving agaricus, or salty mushroom, is an agaric fungus in the family Agaricaceae. The mushroom's thick stem is usually shorter than the diameter of the cap, which ranges from 5–15 centimetres (2–6 inches) and is convex to flattened. The cap surface is whitish to buff, and can develop scales or warts in age. The gills are initially pink before turning brown when the spores mature. The flesh turns reddish when it is cut or bruised. It resembles species such as A. bitorquis. Found in Eurasia, North America, New Zealand, and Australia, A. bernardii is a salt-tolerant species that grows in salt marshes, dunes, and coastal grassland. An edible mushroom, it is stronger in flavor but similar to the store-bought button mushrooms, A. bisporus.
