The raptor subfamily Perninae includes a number of medium-sized broad-winged species. These are birds of warmer climates, although the Pernis species (European honey buzzard and crested honey buzzard) have a more extensive range. Several of the species in this group eat mainly insects, and the honey-buzzards are specialist feeders on wasp larvae. Reptiles are also taken by several birds in this group. Several authorities consider Gypaetinae to be within or even synonymous with Perninae.
