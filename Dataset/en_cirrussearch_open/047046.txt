Black Ruthenia (Latin: Ruthenia Nigra), or Black Rus' (Belarusian: Чорная Русь, romanized: Čornaja Ruś; Lithuanian: Juodoji Rusia; Polish: Ruś Czarna), is a historical region on the Upper Neman, including Novogrudok, Grodno and Slonim. Besides these, other important parts of Black Rus' are Vawkavysk and Białystok. The region was inhabited by the Baltic Yotvingians from ancient times and the name "Black Russia" appeared relatively late. On the 1712 map of French cartographer Henri Chatelain "Russie noire" (Black Ruthenia) is placed in region of Eastern Galicia (today Western Ukraine), which is traditionally known as "Russie rouge" (Red Ruthenia).[citation needed]
