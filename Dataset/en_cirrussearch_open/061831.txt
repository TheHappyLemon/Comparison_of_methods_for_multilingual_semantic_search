The Eurovision Song Contest 2024 is set to be the 68th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It is scheduled to take place in Malmö, Sweden, following the country's victory at the 2023 contest with the song "Tattoo" by Loreen. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT), the contest will be held at the Malmö Arena, and will consist of two semi-finals on 7 and 9 May, and a final on 11 May 2024. The three live shows will be presented by Petra Mede and Malin Åkerman, with the former having previously taken on the role in 2013 and 2016. Thirty-seven countries will participate in the contest, with Luxembourg returning 31 years after its last participation in 1993, while Romania opted not to participate after doing so the previous year.
