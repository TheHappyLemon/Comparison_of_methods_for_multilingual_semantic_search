Terra Nova Bay (74°50′0″S 164°30′0″E﻿ / ﻿74.83333°S 164.50000°E﻿ / -74.83333; 164.50000) is a bay which is often ice free, about 40 nautical miles (74 km; 46 mi) long, lying between Cape Washington and the Drygalski Ice Tongue along the coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica. It was discovered by the British National Antarctic Expedition (known as the Discovery Expedition) under Robert Falcon Scott, 1901–1904, and named by him after Terra Nova, one of the relief ships for the expedition. The Italian permanent Zucchelli Station is located in the bay, as is the Jang Bogo Station of South Korea. The Chinese Qinling Station on Inexpressible Island, opened in 2024, is their fifth station in Antarctica.
