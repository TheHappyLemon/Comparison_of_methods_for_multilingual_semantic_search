The International Canoe Federation (ICF) is the umbrella organization of all national canoe organizations worldwide. It is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and administers all aspects of canoe sport worldwide. 157 countries are affiliated with the ICF after seven national federations were added at the 2008 ICF Congress in Rome. In light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the ICF suspended athletes from Russia and Belarus from competing at any International Canoe Federation events, and suspended all officials from Russia and Belarus from officiating at any event sanctioned by ICF, and from attending or taking part in any ICF meetings, committees, and forums. In March 2023, the Russian Canoe Federation sent a letter addressing the ISF and urging them to reverse the decision and allow Russian athletes to compete at ISF events. The RCF's statement included claims that the war was actually started by Ukraine and that "Russia defends peace". In May 2023, the International Canoe Federation reinstated Russian and Belarusian athletes, shortly after a Russian missile attack forced cancellation of a canoe event in Ukraine.
