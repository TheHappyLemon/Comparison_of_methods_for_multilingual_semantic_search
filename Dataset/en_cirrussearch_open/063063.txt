Tilia henryana Szyszyl., commonly known as Henry's lime, was introduced to the West from China by Ernest Wilson in 1901. The tree is native to the provinces of Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Zhejiang, and was named for the Irish plantsman and sinologist Augustine Henry, who discovered it in 1888.
