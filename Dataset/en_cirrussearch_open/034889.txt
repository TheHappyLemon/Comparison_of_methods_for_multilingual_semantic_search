The following medal table is a list of National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and one non-NOC team ranked by the number of gold medals won by their athletes during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, from 5 to 21 August 2016. Vietnam, Kosovo, Fiji, Singapore, Puerto Rico, Bahrain, Jordan, Tajikistan and Ivory Coast won their first Olympic gold medals (however, Bahrain retroactively was awarded a gold medal for the 2012 Summer Olympics in 2017 due to medals reallocation). They were also the first Olympic medals of any kind for Kosovo, Jordan and Fiji. Kuwaiti shooter Fehaid Al-Deehani became the first independent athlete to win a gold medal, though gold medals have been won under the Olympic flag by other entities, such as countries that competed under the flag at 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow or the Unified Team in 1992. The United States of America led the medal table both in number of gold medals won and in overall medals, winning 46 gold and 121 total medals respectively. Behind the United States, Great Britain were second on the medal table by golds (27) and third by overall medals (67) – their highest ranked finishes in gold since the home games of 1908 and in overall medals since 1920 – while China were third by golds (26) and second by overall medals (70). Both countries were well clear of a following group in the table that included Russia, Germany, France and 2020 host Japan. Athletes from 87 nations earned medals at the 2016 Summer Olympics, breaking the record of most nations winning a medal at a single edition of the Olympics. However, following reallocation due to doping sanctions, an 87th country was later awarded a medal at the 2008 Olympics, tying the record. Athletes from 59 nations earned gold medals at these games, also breaking the record for the most nations winning gold at a single games. Host country Brazil won seven gold medals, their most at any single Summer Olympics.
