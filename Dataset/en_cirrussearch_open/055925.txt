Maniitsoq Airport (Greenlandic: Mittarfik Maniitsoq) (IATA: JSU, ICAO: BGMQ) is an airport located on Maniitsoq Island, 0.5 NM (0.93 km; 0.58 mi) northwest of Maniitsoq, a town in the Qeqqata municipality in central-western Greenland. It can serve STOL aircraft, although there is no deicing equipment at the airport, which is costly and problematic in Greenlandic winter.
