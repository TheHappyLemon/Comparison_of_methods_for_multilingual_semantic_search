In Greek mythology, Nestor of Gerenia (Ancient Greek: Νέστωρ Γερήνιος, Nestōr Gerēnios) was a legendary king of Pylos. He is a prominent secondary character in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, where he appears as an elderly warrior who frequently offers long-winded advice to the other characters. The Mycenaean-era palace at Pylos is known as the Palace of Nestor, though there is no evidence that he was an actual person.
