Starostwo (literally "eldership") is an administrative unit established from the 14th century in the Polish Crown and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until the partition of Poland in 1795. Starostwos were established in the crown lands (królewszczyzna). The term continues to be used in modern Poland.
