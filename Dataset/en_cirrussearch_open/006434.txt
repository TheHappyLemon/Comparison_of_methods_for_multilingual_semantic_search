At the end of August, the single debuted on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Airplay chart at number 17. The video first aired on September 14 on MTV's Total Request Live. A retail single was released the next day. In the UK, the single first entered the Official Charts at number 18 at the end of September, and stayed on the chart for three weeks.
