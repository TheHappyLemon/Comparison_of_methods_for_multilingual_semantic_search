The Republic of China Armed Forces, also known as the ROC Armed Forces are the armed forces of the Republic of China (ROC) that once ruled Mainland China and now currently restricted to its territorial jurisdictions of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu Islands. They consist of the Army, Navy (including the Marine Corps), Air Force and Military Police Force. The military is under the civilian control of the Ministry of National Defense, a cabinet-level agency overseen by the Legislative Yuan. Formerly known as the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), it was renamed as the Republic of China Armed Forces in 1947 due to the implementation of the newly promulgated Constitution of the Republic of China. It was also historically referred as the Chinese National Armed Forces (CNAF) prior to the establishment of the People's Republic of China on the Chinese mainland and the gradual loss of international recognition in the 1970s by the United Nations and many countries, including the ROC's close ally, the United States. Until the 1970s and towards the end of martial law, the military's primary mission was for the ROC to eventually retake mainland China from the communistâ€“controlled People's Republic of China (PRC) through campaigns such as Project National Glory.[citation needed] The military's current foremost mission is the defense of the islands remaining under the control of the ROC, against a possible military invasion by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the PRC, which is seen as the predominant threat to the ROC in the ongoing dispute over the ambiguous political status of Taiwan dating back to the de facto end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. The ROCAF has an approximate active strength of over 200,000 full-time personnel and is capable of mobilising over 180,000 reservists in the event of national exigencies or a full-scale war. It also has a large pool of conscripts, with every fit male citizen of the ROC having to serve a year when they reach the military age of 18.
