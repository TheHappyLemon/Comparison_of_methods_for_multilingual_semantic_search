The Triathlon competitions at the 2008 Summer Olympics, in Beijing, were held on Monday, August 18 (women) and Tuesday, August 19 (men), on the Triathlon Venue at the Ming Tomb Reservoir in Shisanling. Each competitor started the event with a 1,500 metres (0.93 mi) swim course, followed by a 40 kilometres (25 mi) road bicycle race and finished with a 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) road run. Both leg transitions (swimming—cycling and cycling—running) were performed on a special transition area, under judge's scrutiny. The cycling was carried out as 6 laps of 6.66 km each and the running as 4 laps of 2.5 km each.
