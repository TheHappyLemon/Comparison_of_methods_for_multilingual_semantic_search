Weightlifting competitions at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China were held from August 9 to August 19. Competitions were conducted at the Beihang University Gymnasium. The medal records at the 2008 Games were heavily amended following a re-analysis of competitors samples in 2015, 2016 and 2017. 26 lifters were disqualified due to these tests, including 16 medalists and four lifters who stood to inherit forfeited medals.
