The foot (pl.: feet) is an anatomical structure found in many vertebrates. It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows locomotion. In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate[clarification needed] organ at the terminal part of the leg made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws and/or nails.
