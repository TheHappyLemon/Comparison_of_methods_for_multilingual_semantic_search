Speed is a 1994 American action thriller film directed by Jan de Bont (in his feature film directorial debut) and written by Graham Yost. The film stars Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton, and Jeff Daniels. Its story revolves around a bus that is rigged by an extortionist to explode if its speed falls below 50 miles per hour. The film premiered in Hollywood on June 7, 1994, and was released in the rest of the United States on June 10, 1994. It became critically and commercially successful, grossing $350.4 million on a $30–37 million budget, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1994 and winning two Academy Awards for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound. Since its release, it has been regarded as one of the best action films of the 1990s. The film solidified Sandra Bullock as a leading actress and also solidified Reeves as an action movie leading man. A sequel, Speed 2: Cruise Control which fared worse critically and commercially, was released three years later on June 13, 1997, without Reeves's involvement, and with Sandra Bullock in the lead role. It has gone down as one of the worst sequels ever made.
