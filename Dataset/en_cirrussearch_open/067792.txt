Grand Principality of Serbia (Serbian: Великожупанска Србија, romanized: Velikožupanska Srbija), also known by anachronistic exonym as Rascia (Serbian: Рашка, romanized: Raška), was a medieval Serbian state that existed from the second half of the 11th century up until 1217, when it was transformed into the Kingdom of Serbia. After the Grand Principality of Serbia emerged it gradually expanded during the 12th century, encompassing various neighbouring regions, including territories of Raška (Serbian Cyrillic: Рашка; Latin: Rascia), modern Montenegro, Herzegovina, and southern Dalmatia. It was founded by Grand Prince Vukan, who initially (c. 1082) served as regional governor of the principality, appointed by King Constantine Bodin. During Byzantine-Serbian wars (c. 1090) Vukan gained prominence and became a self-governing ruler in inner Serbian regions. He founded the Vukanović dynasty, which ruled the Grand Principality. Through diplomatic ties with the Kingdom of Hungary, Vukan's successors managed to retain their self-governance, while also recognizing the supreme overlordship of the Byzantine Empire, up to 1180. Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja (1166–1196) gained full independence and united almost all Serbian lands. His son, Grand Prince Stefan was crowned King of Serbia in 1217, while his younger son Saint Sava became the first Archbishop of Serbs, in 1219.
