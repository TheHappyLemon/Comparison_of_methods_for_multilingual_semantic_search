The Tana (Finnish: Teno [ˈteno] or Tenojoki; Northern Sami: Deatnu [ˈtea̯tnuː]; Norwegian: Tana/Tanaelva; Swedish: Tana älv) is a 361-kilometre (224 mi) long river in the Sápmi area of northern Fennoscandia. The river flows through Finnmark county, Norway and the Lapland region of Finland. The Sámi name means "Great River". The main tributaries of Tana are Anarjohka and Karasjohka. The Tana Valley is the core area for "the River-Sami Culture" in Finnmark; salmon fishing is central in regard to that culture. History: According to written sources since the last half of the 16th century, fishing has been a major livelihood for the Sami people in the river valley. Another source says since the 17th century. Environmental concerns: erosion at the mouth of the river, in addition to extreme weather, is making the mouth of the river wider but more shallow (as of the 2020s); there is a risk that salmon [or more salmon] during low tide will turn away (from the river) during approach to the river for spawning, according to a committee leader in Tana's municipal council. The ocean has a (considerable) effect on the river, for c. 10 km from the mouth of the river.
