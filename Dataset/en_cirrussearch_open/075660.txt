Brawn GP was a Formula One constructor which competed in the 2009 Formula One World Championship, with drivers Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello. The team was formed in 2009 by a management buyout led by Ross Brawn of the Honda Racing F1 Team, after Honda announced their withdrawal from the sport in December 2008 due to the global financial crisis. The team started development of their car in early 2008, when still owned by Honda. For the 2009 season, Honda provided a $100 million budget, while Mercedes provided engines under a customer relationship. On its racing debut, the season-opening 2009 Australian Grand Prix, the team took pole position and second place in qualifying and went on to finish first and second in the race. Button won six of the first seven races of the season. At the 2009 Brazilian Grand Prix on 18 October, he secured the 2009 Drivers' Championship, while the team won the Constructors' Championship. Barrichello won twice and finished third in the Drivers' Championship. The team won eight of the season's seventeen races, and by taking both titles in its only year of competition became the first, and so far the only constructor to achieve a 100% championship success rate. On 16 November 2009, it was confirmed that the team's engine supplier, Mercedes-Benz, in partnership with Aabar Investments, had purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP, which was renamed Mercedes GP for the 2010 season, many of the Brawn GP former employees were retained by the new Mercedes team following the buyout.
