In geometry, a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms (the term rhomboid is also sometimes used with this meaning). By analogy, it relates to a parallelogram just as a cube relates to a square. Three equivalent definitions of parallelepiped are a hexahedron with three pairs of parallel faces, a polyhedron with six faces (hexahedron), each of which is a parallelogram, and a prism of which the base is a parallelogram. The rectangular cuboid (six rectangular faces), cube (six square faces), and the rhombohedron (six rhombus faces) are all specific cases of parallelepiped. "Parallelepiped" is now usually pronounced /ˌpærəˌlɛlɪˈpɪpɪd/ or /ˌpærəˌlɛlɪˈpaɪpɪd/; traditionally it was /ˌpærəlɛlˈɛpɪpɛd/ PARR-ə-lel-EP-ih-ped despite its etymology in Greek παραλληλεπίπεδον parallelepipedon, a body "having parallel planes". Parallelepipeds are a subclass of the prismatoids.
