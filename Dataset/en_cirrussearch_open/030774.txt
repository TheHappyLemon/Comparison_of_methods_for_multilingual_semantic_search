The shilling is a historical coin, and the name of a unit of modern currencies formerly used in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, other British Commonwealth countries and Ireland, where they were generally equivalent to 12 pence or one-twentieth of a pound before being phased out during the 1960s and 1970s. Currently the shilling is used as a currency in five east African countries: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia, and the de facto country of Somaliland. The East African Community additionally plans to introduce an East African shilling.
