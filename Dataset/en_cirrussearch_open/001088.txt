The Borchgrevink Coast is that portion of the coast of Victoria Land between Cape Adare and Cape Washington. The name was recommended by the New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1961 after Carsten Borchgrevink, a member of Henrik Johan Bull's expedition to this area, 1894–95, and leader of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1898–1900, the first to winter on the continent, at Cape Adare.
