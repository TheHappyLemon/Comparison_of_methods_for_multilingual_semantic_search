The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Chile accepted the convention on 20 February 1980 and currently has 6 sites listed. As of 2014[update], an additional 17 properties have been placed on the tentative list for possible future inclusion on the World Heritage List: 15 cultural sites and two natural sites. Chile had its first site included on the list at the 19th session of World Heritage Committee, held in Germany, 1995. At that session, the Rapa Nui National Park was inscribed on the list.
