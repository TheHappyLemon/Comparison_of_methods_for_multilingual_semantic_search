Albanian comics, though not well known internationally, were produced mainly by comic-authors from Kosovo. Until recently there was no comic tradition in Albania where comics were seen as junk literature known as fumeti (literally, little clouds of smoke) supposedly because pop art was prohibited by the dictatorial communist regime. Today there is one comic magazine published in Kosovo called Leon, and there is TafÃ« Kusuri comic-strip (oldest serial character founded by Agim Qena, and continued by his son Rron Qena) together with Garfield and Calvin and Hobbes (translated in Albanian) published by Koha Ditore newspaper.
