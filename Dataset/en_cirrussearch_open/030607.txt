En Avant Guingamp (Breton: War-raok Gwengamp, English: Forward Guingamp), commonly referred to as EA Guingamp, EAG, or simply Guingamp (French: [ɡɛ̃ɡɑ̃]), is a French professional football club based in the commune of Guingamp, in France's Brittany region. The club was founded in 1912 and play in Ligue 2, the second tier of French football. The club has appeared in the Ligue 1, the top flight of French football, for 13 seasons, and is known for its relative success given Guingamp's small population of only 7,000 people. Guingamp are one of only two clubs who have won the Coupe de France while not being in the first division, doing so in 2009, by defeating Rennes, 2–1. They won the same competition in 2014, again with a victory against Rennes, 2–0.
