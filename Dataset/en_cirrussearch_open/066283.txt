On 16 July 1938, more than 1500 place names in East Prussia were changed, following a decree issued by Gauleiter and Oberpr√§sident Erich Koch and initiated by Adolf Hitler. Most of the names affected were of Old Prussian, Lithuanian and Polish origin; they were either eliminated, Germanized, or simplified. Similar geographical renaming also took place in other parts of Nazi Germany.
