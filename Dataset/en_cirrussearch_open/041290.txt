Quavious Keyate Marshall (born April 2, 1991), known professionally as Quavo (/ˈkweɪvoʊ/), is an American rapper from Athens, Georgia. He is best known as the frontman of the now-defunct hip hop group Migos. Formed with his nephew Takeoff and their mutual friend Offset in 2008, the group released four commercially successful studio albums before disbanding in 2023. As a solo act, Marshall has guest performed on six Billboard Hot 100 top ten singles—Post Malone's diamond-certified "Congratulations", Justin Bieber's "Intentions", Liam Payne's "Strip That Down", Drake's "Portland", and DJ Khaled's "No Brainer" and "I'm the One", the latter of which peaked atop the chart. His debut studio album, Quavo Huncho (2018) peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and spawned the platinum-certified single "Workin Me". His second album, Rocket Power (2023) peaked at number 18 and was released in memory of Takeoff, who was slain the year prior.
