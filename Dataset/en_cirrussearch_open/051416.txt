The Vaalserberg (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈvaːlsərˌbɛr(ə)x]) is a hill with a height of 322.4 metres (1,058 ft) above NAP and is the highest point in the European part of the Netherlands. The Vaalserberg is located in the province of Limburg, at the south-easternmost edge of the country, near the town of Vaals (after which it is named). The Vaalserberg was the highest point anywhere in the Netherlands until the Caribbean island of Saba, with its 887 m (2,910 ft) high volcano, was incorporated into the country as a "special municipality" in 2010.
