"San Francisco" is a song performed by German eurodance recording group Cascada from their fourth studio album, Original Me. The song serves as the album's official first single (second overall) internationally on June 20, 2011. It was written by Yann Peifer, Manuel Reuter, Tony Cornelissen, and Matthew Langlois and it was produced by Reuter and Peifer. Musically, "San Francisco" is an uptempo pop song which relies on electropop and dance-pop styles with influences of music from the 1970s. The song's lyrics are an ode to the city of San Francisco in Northern California. The song was officially released in the UK for download on July 4, 2011. "San Francisco" received criticism for its similarity in sound to Katy Perry's song, "California Gurls". Both songs feature the same tempo and chord progression. The song reached the top fifteen in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands. Unlike previous singles from the group, it failed to make any impact on the pop charts in the United Kingdom, peaking at number sixty-four. The song's accompanying music video sees Horler leading a group of dancers dressed as modern-day hippies to an underground party.
