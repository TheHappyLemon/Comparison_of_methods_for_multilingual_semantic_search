Responsibility – Social Democratic Alliance of Political Parties (Latvian: ATBILDĪBA-sociāldemokrātiska politisko partiju apvienība) was a political coalition in Latvia, until 2010 called Libertas.lv, which was the local branch of Declan Ganley's Libertas Party. Unlike Libertas in other countries, Libertas Latvia was not a political party in its own right. Instead, candidates from Mūsu Zeme, Sociālā Taisnīguma Partija and Latvijas Atmoda (formerly Pensionāru un Senioru Partija) contended the 2009 European Parliament elections in Latvia under common lists branded with the Libertas identity. The candidates retained their membership of their national parties and the national parties retained their legal identity. The alliance collapsed in late 2010. In October 2020 the dissolution of the alliance was officially started.
