Olainfarm AS is a Latvian leading manufacturer in the chemical and pharmaceutical sector of the Baltic States. The company was founded in 1972 as state enterprise "Olaines ķīmiski – farmaceitiskā rūpnīca" (Olaine Chemical-Pharmaceutical Plant). The main goal of founding the company was to ensure pharmaceutical substances and intermediates to several finished drug form manufacturing plants in the Soviet Union. As a result of privatization in 1997, the company was reorganized into a joint stock company, and its shares were listed on stock exchange. Olainfarm produces over 60 final dosage forms, 25 active pharmaceutical ingredients and 20 intermediates. The product portfolio is well diversified with the main emphasis on branded products, historically unique to Olainfarm. The key areas of specialization in final dosage forms include neurology (cholinesterase inhibitors, anxiolytics, psychostimulants, nootropics), cardiology (antiarrhythmics, energy metabolism enhancers), infectology (original nitrofurantoine derivatives and antivirals) and allergology (fast acting antihistamines).
