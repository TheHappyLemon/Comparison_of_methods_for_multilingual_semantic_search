Jumper is a 2008 American science fiction action film loosely based on Steven Gould's 1992 novel of the same name. Directed by Doug Liman, the film stars Hayden Christensen as a young man capable of teleporting, as he is chased by a secret society intent on killing him. Jamie Bell, Rachel Bilson, Max Thieriot, AnnaSophia Robb, Diane Lane, Michael Rooker, and Samuel L. Jackson also star. The script went through a rewrite prior to filming, and the roles for the main characters were changed during production. Filmed in 20 cities and 14 countries from 2007 to 2008 and released on February 14, 2008, the film grossed $225 million worldwide and received generally negative reviews from critics, mostly because of the many changes to Gould's novel, rushed plot, and anticlimactic ending.
