Expressway S8 or express road S8, officially named The Route of the Heroes of the Battle of Warsaw 1920 (pl. droga ekspresowa S8, Trasa Bohaterów Bitwy Warszawskiej 1920 r.) is a Polish highway which connects Wrocław via Łódź and Warsaw to Białystok. The whole road is 554 km (344 mi) long. Its fragment forming the bypass of Wrocław (22.7 km) is constructed in motorway standard and marked as A8. The road was constructed between 2008 and 2019 (short fragments serving as bypasses of some towns had been constructed earlier). The construction was co-funded by the European Union. In 2019, it was announced that an extension of S8 from Wrocław to Kłodzko was added to the plans. Its main part is planned to be opened by 2027. In 2022, it was announced that there are plans for extending the road further from Kłodzko to the Polish-Czech border in Boboszów which might be constructed by 2033, however in the Czech Republic there is so far no planned expressway that would connect to it.
