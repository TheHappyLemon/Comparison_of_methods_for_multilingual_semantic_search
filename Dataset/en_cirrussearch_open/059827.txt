The Chaplino dialect (also known as Chaplinski dialect, Chaplinski Yupik, Eskimo Uŋaziq and Chaplinski language) is a dialect of the Central Siberian Yupik language spoken by the indigenous Eskimo people along the coast of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the Russian Far East, in the villages of Novoye Chaplino ("New Chaplino"), Provideniya, Uelkal and Sireniki. The Chaplino dialect is named after the village of Chaplino [ru] (also known as "Old Chaplino"; native name is "Уӈазиӄ" (Uŋaziq), from уӈаӄ "whisker" + suffix -зиӄ/-сиӄ). The Chaplino dialect is spoken by the majority of Russian Yuits. The Chaplino dialect is close in lexicon and grammar to that of the St. Lawrence Island Yupik dialect ("Sivuqaghmiistun").
