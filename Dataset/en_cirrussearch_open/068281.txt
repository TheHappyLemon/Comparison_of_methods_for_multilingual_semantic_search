The Baltic Republican Party (BRP; Russian: Балтийская республиканская партия, romanized: Baltiyskaya respublikanskaya partiya) was a political party in the Russian Federation. Founded on 1 December 1993 in Kaliningrad Oblast and lost its official status as a political party on 26 March 2003 due to the new Russian Law on political parties which requires that each party should have regional branches in at least half of the Russian Federation constituencies and at least 10,000 members in strength. An appeal was lost in February 2005 before the Constitutional Court of Russia. The main political purpose of the party was the establishment of an autonomous Baltic Republic instead of the Kaliningrad region, possibly total independence. It also wanted the old name Königsberg restored. Its leaders are Sergei Pasko and Rustam Vasiliev. In February 2005 the constituent congress of the Kaliningrad Public Movement – Respublika took place in Kaliningrad. It has the same objectives as the BRP, its co-chairmen are Sergei Pasko and Vitautas Lopata, an independent deputy of the regional Duma and local chairperson of the opposition Russian People's Democratic Union. In 2023, party leader Rustam Vasiliev decried the increased isolation of the region following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In the same interview, he declared that an increasing number of the region's residents were supportive of the party, and that a break from Moscow was ultimately inevitable. The party claims that Moscow is a barrier to the region's economic development and that the region "belongs to Europe".
