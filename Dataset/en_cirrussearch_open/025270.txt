In English grammar, an adverbial (abbreviated adv) is a word (an adverb) or a group of words (an adverbial clause or adverbial phrase) that modifies or more closely defines the sentence or the verb. (The word adverbial itself is also used as an adjective, meaning "having the same function as an adverb".) Look at the examples below: Danny speaks fluently. (telling more about the verb) Lorna ate breakfast yesterday morning. (telling when the verb's action occurred)
