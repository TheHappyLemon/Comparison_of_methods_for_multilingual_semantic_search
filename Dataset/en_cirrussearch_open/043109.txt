Fragaria vesca, commonly called the wild strawberry, woodland strawberry, Alpine strawberry, Carpathian strawberry or European strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the rose family that grows naturally throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere, and that produces edible fruits. The Latin specific epithet vesca may mean "thin, feeble", however it likely derives in the sense of "edible" from vescere "to eat, feed upon".
