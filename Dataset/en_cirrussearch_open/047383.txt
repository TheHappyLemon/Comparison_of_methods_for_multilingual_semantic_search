Frida Karlsson (born 10 August 1999) is a Swedish cross-country skier. She won a silver medal in the women's 10 kilometres classical, bronze medal in the women's 30 kilometre freestyle mass start, and gold as a member of the women's 4 × 5 kilometre relay during the 2019 FIS World Championships in Seefeld in Tirol, Austria. With this win, she became the youngest cross-country skiing World Cup gold medalist in history. In April 2018, she received a 50,000 Swedish kronor prize for promising new skiers from former skier Johan Olsson and a bank. The award also gave her the opportunity to use Olsson as a mentor. Karlsson is the daughter of former cross-country skier Ann-Marie Karlsson. The 2022–2023 season saw Frida Karlsson winning the Tour de Ski.
