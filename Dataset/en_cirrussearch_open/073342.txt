The men's double trap event at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place on August 12 at the Beijing Shooting Range Clay Target Field. Walton Eller, the gold medal winner in this event, broke two Olympic records for both the qualification and final rounds. The event consisted of two rounds: a qualifier and a final. In the qualifier, each shooter fired 3 sets of 50 shots in trap shooting. Shots were paired, with two targets being launched at a time. The top 6 shooters in the qualifying round moved on to the final round. There, they fired one additional round of 50. The total score from all 200 shots was used to determine final ranking. Ties are broken using a shoot-off; additional shots are fired one pair at a time until there is no longer a tie.
