After starting his career with Figueirense in 2009, Firmino spent four-and-a-half seasons at TSG Hoffenheim. His 16 goals in 33 games in the 2013–14 Bundesliga season earned him the award for the league's Breakthrough Player. In July 2015, he signed for Liverpool, where he earned plaudits for his creativity, goalscoring and workrate; manager Jürgen Klopp referred to Firmino as the "engine" that propelled the club's counter-pressing system. He formed a formidable attacking trio with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané after the departure of Philippe Coutinho. In the 2018–19 season, Firmino won the UEFA Champions League, and the following campaign claimed the UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup (after scoring the winner in the final), and the 2019–20 Premier League title. He also won the FA Cup and EFL Cup with Liverpool in the 2021–22 season. Firmino is widely regarded as a cult hero in Liverpool. In 2023, Firmino decided not to extend his contract at Liverpool, and eventually left on a free transfer to Saudi club Al-Ahli, after 8 years at Liverpool. Firmino made his international debut for Brazil in November 2014. He represented the nation at the 2015, 2019 and 2021 Copa América, as well as the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
