Paneth cells are cells in the small intestine epithelium, alongside goblet cells, enterocytes, and enteroendocrine cells. Some can also be found in the cecum and appendix. They are located below the intestinal stem cells in the intestinal glands (also called crypts of Lieberk√ºhn) and the large eosinophilic refractile granules that occupy most of their cytoplasm. When exposed to bacteria or bacterial antigens, Paneth cells secrete several anti-microbial compounds (notably defensins and lysozyme) that are known to be important in immunity and host-defense into the lumen of the intestinal gland, thereby contributing to maintenance of the gastrointestinal barrier by controlling the enteric bacteria. Therefore, Paneth cells play a role in the innate immune system. Paneth cells are named after 19th-century pathologist Joseph Paneth.
