Silent Hill: Downpour is a 2012 survival horror game developed by Vatra Games and published by Konami. Downpour is set in the series' eponymous fictitious American town and centers on Murphy Pendleton, a prisoner who enters the town, periodically entering the otherworld, leading him to unlock repressed memories. The game uses a third-person view and can be played in 3D. It was released in March 2012. Silent Hill: Downpour received mixed reviews from gaming critics, who praised its atmosphere, story and return to the series' survival horror and exploration roots after the action-heavy linearity of Silent Hill: Homecoming, but criticised its monster design, combat and technical performance. A patch fixed many of the technical issues.
