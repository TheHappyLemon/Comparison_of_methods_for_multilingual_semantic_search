The National Guard of the Russian Federation (Russian: Федера́льная слу́жба войск национа́льной гва́рдии Росси́йской Федера́ции, romanized: Federalnaya sluzhba voysk natsionalnoy gvardii Rossiyskoy Federatsii) or Rosgvardiya (Russian: Росгва́рдия, lit. 'Rosguard') is the internal military force of Russia, comprising an independent agency that reports directly to the President of Russia Vladimir Putin under his powers as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and Chairman of the Security Council. The National Guard is separate from the Russian Armed Forces. A law signed by President of Russia Vladimir Putin established the federal executive body in 2016. The National Guard has the stated mission of securing Russia's borders, taking charge of gun control, combating terrorism and organized crime, protecting public order and guarding important state facilities. The establishment of the National Guard was seen[by whom?] as an effort to enhance efficiency and to avoid duplication of responsibilities within the Russian security system, a result of an extensive assessment of strategic challenges facing Russia.: 6  Others have accused the Rosgvardiya of being an attempt by Putin to create a private army to control civil strife or attempts of a colour revolution, not only domestically but also abroad in friendly regimes. As of 2018[update] the National Guard numbered approximately 340,000 personnel in 84 units across Russia; it consolidated the forces of the MVD Internal Troops, SOBR, OMON and other internal military forces outside of the Russian Armed Forces. In 2017, President of Russia Vladimir Putin designated 27 March as National Guard Day, linking the National Guard to a long history of public-security services within Russia – a decree of Emperor Alexander I organised the Internal Guards Corps [ru] on 27 March in the Old Style Julian calendar in 1811.
