Dorothea of Bulgaria (Bulgarian: Доротея, Serbo-Croatian: Doroteja, Доротеја; died c. 1390), also called Doroslava (Cyrillic: Дорослава), was the first Queen of Bosnia. Daughter of the Bulgarian tsar Ivan Sratsimir, Dorothea was held hostage by King Louis I of Hungary, who married her off to Ban Tvrtko I of Bosnia in 1374. She became queen in 1377 and may have been the mother of King Tvrtko II.
