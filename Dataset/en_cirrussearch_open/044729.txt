Christian Mate Pulisic (/ˈmɑːteɪ pəˈlɪsɪk, ˈpʊlɪsɪtʃ/; Croatian: Pulišić, pronounced [krǐstijan mǎːte pǔliʃitɕ]; born September 18, 1998) is an American professional soccer player who plays as a winger or attacking midfielder for Serie A club AC Milan and captains the United States national team. Regarded as one of the best North American players in the world, he is nicknamed "Captain America" for his dribbling abilities, explosive speed, and finishing. An alumni of the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, Pulisic began his professional career at Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund, where he progressed quickly through the team's youth academy, featuring in only 15 youth games. He was then promoted to the senior team in 2016, at age 17. He featured sparingly in his first season at the club, but his involvement began increasing dramatically in the following season, where he was a mainstay in the Dortmund team that won the 2016–17 DFB-Pokal. His performances made him a finalist for the 2017 Golden Boy award and runner-up of the 2018 Kopa Trophy. In January 2019, Pulisic moved to Premier League club Chelsea in a transfer worth $73 million (£57.6 million), making him the most expensive North American player of all time, and began playing for the club in the 2019–20 season. In 2021, he was an integral part of the team that won the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League, and became the first American to play in a Champions League final. With Chelsea he also won the 2021 UEFA Super Cup and 2021 FIFA Club World Cup, before moving to Serie A club AC Milan in June 2023. Pulisic played for the United States at under-15 and under-17 levels, before making his senior national team debut in March 2016 at age 17. He is the youngest player ever to captain the United States national team in the modern era. He reached the final of the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup, where he was named best young player of the tournament. He won the CONCACAF Nations League in 2021, 2023 and 2024, winning the best player award of the 2023 tournament. Individually, he has won a U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year award and is tied with Landon Donovan for the record of four U.S. Soccer Player of the Year awards. He has been called the "face" of American soccer.
