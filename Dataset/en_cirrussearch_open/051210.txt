The 1999 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association’s 1998-99 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs defeating the Eastern Conference champion New York Knicks 4 games to 1. Tim Duncan was named NBA Finals MVP. The 1999 Playoffs are memorable in that a #8 seed (the Knicks) made it to the Finals for the only time in history until 2023, and that came after a lockout–shortened 50–game season.
