Nottingham Forest Football Club is a professional association football club based in West Bridgford, Nottingham, England. The team compete in the Premier League, the first level of the English football league system. Founded in 1865, Forest have played their home games at the City Ground since 1898. Nottingham Forest have won two European Cups (now the UEFA Champions League), being one of six English clubs to have won the European Cup. They have also won one UEFA Super Cup, one League title, two FA Cups, four League Cups, and one FA Charity Shield. The club has competed in the top two tiers of English football since its admission to the Football League, with the exception of five seasons in the third tier. Its most successful period was under the management of Brian Clough and Peter Taylor in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which included back-to-back wins in the then European Cup in 1979 and 1980. In Clough's last decade at the club, the Nottingham Forest team won the 1989 and 1990 League Cups and were losing finalists in the 1991 FA Cup final and 1992 League Cup final, before relegation from the Premier League in 1993. Upon an immediate return, Forest finished third in the Premier League in 1995 before again suffering relegation from the top flight in 1997 and 1999. The team returned to the Premier League by winning the play-offs in 2022. Forest's fiercest rivalry is with Derby County, with which club it contests an East Midlands derby. In 2007 the Brian Clough Trophy was founded, which has since then been given to the winner of this East Midlands Derby.
