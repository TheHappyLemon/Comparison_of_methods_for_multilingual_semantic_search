The emblem of Kazakhstan (Kazakh: Қазақстан елтаңбасы, romanized: Qаzаqstаn eltаñbasy) was adopted on 4 June 1992. The designers of the emblem are Jandarbek Melibekov and Shot-Aman Ualikhan [kk]. About 245 projects and 67 description designs of the future arms took part in the final competition. Like other post-Soviet republics whose symbols do not predate the October Revolution, the current emblem retains some components of the Soviet one, in this case, rising sun rays and star. Prior to 1992, Kazakhstan had an emblem similar to all other Soviet Republics. In March 2024, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced that the emblem would soon be changed because of its complicated and "Soviet-like" design. The new emblem will be decided through a contest.
