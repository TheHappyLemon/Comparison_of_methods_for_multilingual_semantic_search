It opened in 1990. The area was visited by early 19th century sealers operating from nearby Clothier Harbour. The base is named after the Spanish-American astronomer, topographer, and geographer Pedro Vicente Maldonado (1704â€“1748) born in Riobamba, present Ecuador. There is a lighthouse near the base.
