Osama bin Laden was a rogue bull elephant named after the notorious terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. He was responsible for at least 27 deaths and the destruction of property in the jungled Sonitpur district of the Indian state of Assam. After a two-year rampage from 2004 to 2006, the elephant was eventually shot, though some were doubtful that the correct animal had been killed. Two other now-deceased killer elephants active following 2006 were also given the name "Osama bin Laden" or "Laden".
