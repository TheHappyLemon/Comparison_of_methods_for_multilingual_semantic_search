3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (also known as MDA and sass) is an empathogen-entactogen, psychostimulant, and psychedelic drug of the amphetamine family that is encountered mainly as a recreational drug. In its pharmacology, MDA is a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA). In most countries, the drug is a controlled substance and its possession and sale are illegal. MDA is rarely sought as a recreational drug compared to other amphetamines; however, it remains widely used due to it being a primary metabolite, the product of hepatic N-dealkylation, of MDMA (ecstasy). It is also a common adulterant of illicitly produced MDMA.
