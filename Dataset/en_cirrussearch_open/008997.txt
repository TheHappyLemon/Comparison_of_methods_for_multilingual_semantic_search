A referendum on the transfer of Riga Cathedral to the Lutheran Church was held in Latvia on 5 and 6 September 1931. Following a 1923 referendum the Lutheran Church had been forced to share the cathedral with the Roman Catholic Church. The referendum was passed by a large margin, and despite a voter turnout of only 32%, the government decided to proceed with the legislation. The outcome of the referendum led to an increase in the popularity of civic parties in the parliamentary elections in October.
