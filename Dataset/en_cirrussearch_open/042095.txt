Fatma Sultan (Ottoman Turkish: فاطمہ سلطان) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Selim I. She was the sister of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Fatma's first husband was Mustafa Pasha, the governor-general of Antalya. He, however, turned out to be homosexual. In a letter written to her father, she expresses her distress. She complains that her husband's open display of homosexual tendencies deeply offends her, saying, "My royal padishah, I have not smiled for one day, for one hour since my coming here one year ago... I am going mad as if I were a widow. My royal sultan, my dearest dad, my state cannot be expressed with a pen." After divorce from Mustafa Pasha, Fatma married Kara Ahmed Pasha. He began his career as a vizier. In 1553, he became grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire until his execution in 1555. Fatma commissioned a mosque in Topkapı, near the mosque of her husband Ahmed Pasha, where she is buried.
