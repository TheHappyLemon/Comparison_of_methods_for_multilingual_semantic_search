A hexomino (or 6-omino) is a polyomino of order 6; that is, a polygon in the plane made of 6 equal-sized squares connected edge to edge. The name of this type of figure is formed with the prefix hex(a)-. When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, there are 35 different free hexominoes. When reflections are considered distinct, there are 60 one-sided hexominoes. When rotations are also considered distinct, there are 216 fixed hexominoes.
