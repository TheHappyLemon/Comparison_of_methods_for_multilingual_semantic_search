The COVID-19 pandemic in Lithuania was a part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Lithuania in February 2020. On 18 March 2020, the first domestic case was confirmed, the first infected being an immediate family member of a known case. The first cases of community spread were found in the country on 19 March and the first related death occurred on 20 March 2020. The Lithuanian government initially declared a quarantine from 16 March to 30 March, but it was extended several times and was set to end on 16 June. On 17 June, the quarantine was lifted. Starting from 21 October and lasting until 4 November, the government implemented color-based zones throughout Lithuania, with green meaning fewer or light restrictions and red meaning tight and heavy restrictions. But due to the rising numbers, the government announced a national lockdown on 4 November. The lockdown was set to last until 29 November, but was later lengthened until 1 July 2021. On 17 September, the last municipality with no coronavirus cases, Birštonas, confirmed its first case. All 60 municipalities have since recorded at least one confirmed case of infection. The vaccination program began on 27 December 2020, as in the rest of the European Union. The first to receive the vaccine were healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients, followed by the elderly and other senior age groups with medical conditions. Lithuania vaccinated one-third of its population on 22 May 2021. As of 1 July 2022, 72.59% of Lithuania's population has received at least one dose, while 69.77% have received at least two, while 34.74% of the population has received a booster dose. As of 21 January 2023, 4,529,015 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in Lithuania. As of 23 March 2022, more than 1 million people have been infected at least once since the pandemic began.
