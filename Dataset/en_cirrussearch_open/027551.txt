In music, flat means lower in pitch. It may either be used generically, meaning any lowering of pitch, or refer to a particular size: lowering pitch by a chromatic semitone. A flat is the opposite of a sharp (♯) which raises pitch by the same amount that a flat lowers it. The flat symbol (♭) is used in two ways: It is placed in key signatures to mark lines whose notes are flattened throughout that section of music; it may also be an "accidental" that precedes an individual note and indicates that the note should be lowered temporarily, until the following bar line.
