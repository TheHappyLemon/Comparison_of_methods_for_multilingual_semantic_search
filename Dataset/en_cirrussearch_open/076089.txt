State Anthem of the Latvian SSR (Latvian: Latvijas PSR himna; Russian: Гимн Латвийской ССР, romanized: Gimn Latviyskoy SSR) was the anthem of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic from 1945 to 1990 when Latvia was part of the Soviet Union. During Soviet rule, the previous anthem, "Dievs, svētī Latviju!", composed by Kārlis Baumanis was illegal and the anthem was approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic on 19 July 1945. The original lyrics had references to Joseph Stalin until its replacement in 1977 when the references of him were removed. After Latvia regained independence in 1990, Dievs, svētī Latviju! was restored as its anthem on 15 February 1991.
