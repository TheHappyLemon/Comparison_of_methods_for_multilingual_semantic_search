The 1962 Ice Hockey World Championships was the 29th edition of the Ice Hockey World Championships. The tournament was held in Colorado Springs and Denver, United States from March 8 to March 18, 1962. This was the first World Championship hosted in North America that was not part of ice hockey at the Olympic Games. It also remains the only IIHF World Championship (not also part of the Olympics) ever held in the United States. The World Championships were in jeopardy of being cancelled to the political situation in Europe and the Berlin Wall. Sweden won their third World, and their ninth European title. Canada, represented by the Galt Terriers, lost only to the Swedes finishing second, followed by the host Americans. In the 'B' pool the Australian team defeated Denmark for their first victory ever.
