The tree pipit (Anthus trivialis) is a small passerine bird which breeds across most of Europe and the Palearctic as far East as the East Siberian Mountains. It is a long-distance migrant moving in winter to Africa and southern Asia. The scientific name is from Latin: anthus is the name for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific trivialis means "common". The breeding habitat is open woodland and scrub. The nest is placed on the ground, with usually 4â€“6 eggs being laid. This species is insectivorous, like its relatives, but will also take seeds.
