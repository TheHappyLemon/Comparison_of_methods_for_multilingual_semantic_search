The modern pentathlon at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro took place from 19 to 20 August 2016 at Deodoro Aquatics Centre, Deodoro Stadium, and Youth Arena. Thirty-six athletes competed each in the men's and women's events. Initially the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM) proposed that all five events be staged in the same arena. While this did not eventuate, all venues were within approximately 300.0 metres (984.3Â ft) of each other.
