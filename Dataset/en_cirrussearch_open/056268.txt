Syrtis Major Planum is a "dark spot" (an albedo feature) located in the boundary between the northern lowlands and southern highlands of Mars just west of the impact basin Isidis in the Syrtis Major quadrangle. It was discovered, on the basis of data from Mars Global Surveyor, to be a low-relief shield volcano, but was formerly believed to be a plain, and was then known as Syrtis Major Planitia. The dark color comes from the basaltic volcanic rock of the region and the relative lack of dust. The selected landing site for the Mars 2020 rover mission was Jezero crater (at 18°51′18″N 77°31′08″E﻿ / ﻿18.855°N 77.519°E﻿ / 18.855; 77.519) within the region. The northeastern region of Syrtis Major Planum was also considered a potential landing site.
