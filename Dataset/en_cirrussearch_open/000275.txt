Ādaži ([ˈaː.da.ʒi]) (formerly German: Neuermühlen) is a town in Pierīga, on the left bank of the Gauja river. The town is the administrative center of the Ādaži Municipality. It is located by the highway A1, 21.6 km from the center of Riga. Ādaži has administrative offices, schools (Ādaži Elementary School, Ādaži Secondary School, and Ādaži Free Waldorf School), Kindergarten Strautins, several shops (Maxima, Rimi, Elvi) and service companies. Latvia's longest river, the Gauja, flows along the Ādaži River, and its tributary Vējupe divides the town into two parts. Ādaži also has an eponymous wakeboarding club on the Gauja. The town is mostly known due to the nearby Latfood factory producing Ādažu Čipsi, the best known potato chip brand in Latvia.
