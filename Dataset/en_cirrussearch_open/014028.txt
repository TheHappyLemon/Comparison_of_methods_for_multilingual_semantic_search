Macrolepiota procera, the parasol mushroom, is a basidiomycete fungus with a large, prominent fruiting body resembling a parasol. It is a fairly common species on well-drained soils. It is found solitary or in groups and fairy rings in pastures and occasionally in woodland. It is widespread in temperate regions of Eurasia and possibly North America. Further research is needed to confirm whether specimens found in North America are the same species.
