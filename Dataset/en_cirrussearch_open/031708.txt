Claude Bernard (French: [bɛʁnaʁ]; 12 July 1813 – 10 February 1878) was a French physiologist. Historian I. Bernard Cohen of Harvard University called Bernard "one of the greatest of all men of science". He originated the term milieu intérieur, and the associated concept of homeostasis (the latter term being coined by Walter Cannon).
