Her voice and disco-influenced production have received critical acclaim and media coverage. She has won numerous accolades throughout her career including seven Brit Awards and three Grammy Awards. Lipa worked as a model before signing a recording contract with Warner Bros. in 2014. She rose to prominence with her eponymous debut album in 2017, which peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and spawned the successful singles "Be the One", "IDGAF", and the UK number-one single "New Rules". Lipa was honoured with the Brit Awards for British Female Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act. Her second chart-topping single, "One Kiss" with Calvin Harris, was the best-selling song of 2018 and won the Brit Award for Song of the Year. In 2019, Lipa won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist and for Best Dance Recording for "Electricity", her collaborative single with Silk City. Lipa's second album, Future Nostalgia (2020), became her first UK number-one album, and won the Brit Award for British Album of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Its lead single, "Don't Start Now", scored the longest top-ten stay for a British female artist on the UK Singles Chart and ranked in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart of 2020. The album's success continued with the follow-up singles "Physical", "Break My Heart", and "Levitating", which topped the Billboard year-end Hot 100 chart of 2021 and was certified diamond in the US. Both of Lipa's albums are the most-streamed female albums on Spotify, with over 10 billion streams each. Lipa subsequently scored her third and fourth UK number-one singles with the 2021 Elton John duet "Cold Heart (Pnau remix)" and "Dance the Night" from the soundtrack of the film Barbie (2023), where she also made her acting debut.
