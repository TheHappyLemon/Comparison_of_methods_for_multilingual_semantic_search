Hobbs & Shaw (also known as Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw) is a 2019 action buddy comedy film directed by David Leitch from a script by Chris Morgan and Drew Pearce. It is the first spin-off film and the overall ninth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise, set after the events of The Fate of the Furious (2017). It stars Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Idris Elba, Vanessa Kirby, Eiza Gonz√°lez, Cliff Curtis and Helen Mirren. In the film, Luke Hobbs (Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Statham) joins Deckard's sister Hattie Shaw (Kirby) to take down Brixton Lore (Elba), a cybernetically enhanced terrorist, who is threatening the world with a deadly virus. Series star and producer Vin Diesel first said in 2015 that possible spin-offs were in early development, and Hobbs & Shaw was officially announced in October 2017. Leitch signed on to direct in April 2018, and Kirby and Elba both joined the cast that July. Principal photography began that September and lasted through January 2019, with filming locations including London, Glasgow, and Kaua'i. The film was subject to controversy after longterm Fast & Furious producer Neal H. Moritz filed a lawsuit against Universal Pictures for breach of oral contract and committing promissory fraud related to his role on Hobbs & Shaw, which was eventually settled in September 2020. Hobbs & Shaw premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on July 13, 2019, was theatrically released in the United States on August 2, 2019, by Universal Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the chemistry between Johnson and Statham, but found it underwhelming when compared to other Fast & Furious films. Hobbs & Shaw grossed $760 million worldwide.
