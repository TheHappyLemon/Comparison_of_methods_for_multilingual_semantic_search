The 84th "Givati" Brigade (Hebrew: חֲטִיבַת גִּבְעָתִי, lit. '"Hill Brigade" or "Highland Brigade"') is an Israel Defense Forces infantry brigade formed in 1947. During the 1948 war, it was involved in capturing Palestinian villages in operations Hametz, Barak, and Pleshet. Before Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, the Brigade was stationed within the Gaza Strip. Givati soldiers are designated by purple berets. The Brigade's symbol is the fox, alluding to Shualei Shimshon (שועלי שמשון, lit. "Samson's Foxes"), a unit in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.
