The Lavanttal Alps (German: Lavanttaler Alpen, Slovene: Labotni≈°ke Alpe) are part of the Central Eastern Alps in Austria and Slovenia, between the river Mur in the north and the Drava in the south. The mountains are named after the central valley of Lavanttal and the Lavant River which runs in their midst. Historically they were also viewed, along with the neighbouring Gurktal Alps range, as part of the larger "Noric Alps", but that grouping had no geological basis.
