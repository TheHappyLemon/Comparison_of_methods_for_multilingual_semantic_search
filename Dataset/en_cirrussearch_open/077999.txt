The Saale (German pronunciation: [ˈzaːlə] ), also known as the Saxon Saale (German: Sächsische Saale pronounced [ˈzɛksɪʃə ˈzaːlə] ) and Thuringian Saale (German: Thüringische Saale), is a river in Germany and a left-bank tributary of the Elbe. It is not to be confused with the smaller Franconian Saale, a right-bank tributary of the Main, or the Saale in Lower Saxony, a tributary of the Leine.
