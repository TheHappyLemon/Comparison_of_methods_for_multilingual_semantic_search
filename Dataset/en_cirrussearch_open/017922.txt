Brody Raion (Ukrainian: Бродівський район, romanized: Brodivs’kyi raion) was a raion (district) of Lviv Oblast in western Ukraine. Its administrative center was Brody. The raion was abolished on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Lviv Oblast to seven. The area of Brody Raion was merged into Zolochiv Raion. The last estimate of the population of the raion was 57,457 (2020 est.). The raion was located at the easternmost portion of Lviv Oblast bordering with Rivne and Ternopil Oblasts to its east, Volyn Oblast to the north, Radekhiv Raion to the northwest, Busk Raion to the west, and Zolochiv Raion to the southwest. Historically, the district (county) became known as border checkpoint between the Austria-Hungary Empire and the Russian Empire. As a county (powiat) it was established in 1866 as part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. After World War I, the area became part of the Second Polish Republic within the Tarnopol Voivodeship. During the invasion of Soviet forces at the beginning of World War II, the district was established by the Soviet administration. The raion had a city administrative area, a "town with three other villages" administrative area and 23 rural councils which were formed out of the rest of the 73 villages. Some councils included up to 10 villages (Ponykva), while some consisted only of a pair of villages.
