The new Israeli shekel (Hebrew: שֶׁקֶל חָדָשׁ, romanized: sheqel ẖadash, pronounced [ˈʃekel χaˈdaʃ] ; Arabic: شيكل جديد, romanized: šēkal jadīd; sign: ₪; ISO code: ILS; unofficial abbreviation: NIS), also known as simply the Israeli shekel (Hebrew: שקל ישראלי, romanized: sheqel yisreʾeli; Arabic: شيكل إسرائيلي, romanized: šēkal ʾisrāʾīlī), is the currency of Israel and is also used as a legal tender in the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The new shekel is divided into 100 agorot. The new shekel has been in use since 1 January 1986, when it replaced the hyperinflated old shekel at a ratio of 1000:1. The currency sign for the new shekel ⟨ ₪ ⟩ is a combination of the first Hebrew letters of the words shekel (ש‎) and ẖadash (ח‎) (new). When the shekel sign is unavailable the abbreviation NIS (ש״ח and ش.ج) is used.
