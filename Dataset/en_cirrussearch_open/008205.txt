The Serbia men's national football team (Serbian Cyrillic: Фудбалска репрезентација Србије, romanized: Fudbalska reprezentacija Srbije) represents Serbia in men's international football competition. It is controlled by the Football Association of Serbia, the governing body for football in Serbia. After the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia and its football team in 1992 Serbia was represented (alongside Montenegro) within the new FR Yugoslavia national football team. Despite qualifying for Euro 1992 the team was banned from participating in the tournament due to international sanctions, with the ruling also enforced for 1994 World Cup and Euro 1996 qualifiers. The national team played its first friendly in December 1994, and with the easing of sanctions the generation of the 1990s eventually participated at the 1998 World Cup, reaching the round of 16, and the quarter-finals at Euro 2000. The team played in the 2006, 2010, 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups, but failed to progress past the group stage on each occasion. Between February 2003 and June 2006 Serbia participated as Serbia and Montenegro due to the countries' name change. Following a 2006 referendum Montenegro declared its independence, leading to separate football federations which resulted in the team's final renaming and establishment as the Serbia national football team. Serbia is considered by FIFA and UEFA to be the official successor team of FR Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro national football teams, but also the Kingdom of Yugoslavia/SFR Yugoslavia team.
