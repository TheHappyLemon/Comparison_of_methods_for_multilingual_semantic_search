Vladimir-Suzdal (Russian: Владимирско-Су́здальская, Vladimirsko-Suzdal'skaya), formally known as the Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal or Grand Principality of Vladimir (1157–1331) (Russian: Владимиро-Су́здальское кня́жество, romanized: Vladimiro-Suzdal'skoye knyazhestvo, lit. 'Vladimiro-Suzdalian principality'; Latin: Volodimeriae), also as Suzdalia or Vladimir-Suzdalian Rus', was one of the major principalities emerging from Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century, centered in Vladimir-on-Klyazma. With time the principality grew into a grand principality divided into several smaller principalities. After being conquered by the Mongol Empire, the principality became a self-governed state headed by its own nobility. A governorship of the principality, however, was prescribed by a jarlig (declaration by the Khan) issued from the Golden Horde to a Rurikid sovereign.
