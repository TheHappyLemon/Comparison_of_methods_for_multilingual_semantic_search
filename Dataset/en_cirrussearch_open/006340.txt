Good News is the second studio album released by German singer Lena Meyer-Landrut. It was released by Universal Music on 8 February 2011 in German-speaking Europe, following her win of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2010. The album includes all songs Meyer-Landrut performed during the televised preselection process for the song that she would perform at the 2011 contest to defend her title. Recorded within five weeks only, she reteamed with mentor, entertainer Stefan Raab, to work on the majority of the album. The album earned largely positive reviews from music critics who praised relaxed nature and called it an enjoyable and likable listen. As with its predecessor, Good News became Meyer-Landrut's second album to debut at number one on the German Albums Chart. It also reached the top ten in Austria and the top 20 in Switzerland, but was commercially less successful elsewhere. In fall 2011, the album was certified Platinum by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI).
