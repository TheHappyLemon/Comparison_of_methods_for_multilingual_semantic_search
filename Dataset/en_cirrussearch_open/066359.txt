The KTM-5, later known as the 71-605, is a Soviet tram model manufactured by UKVZ. First introduced in 1963, the KTM-5 was mass-produced between 1969 and 1992, with a total of 14,991 tramcars being made. KTM-5 trams were built exclusively for the Soviet Union, and therefore are currently only operating in post-Soviet states.
