Archilochus (/ɑːrˈkɪləkəs/; Greek: Ἀρχίλοχος Arkhílokhos; c. 680 – c. 645 BC) was a Greek lyric poet of the Archaic period from the island of Paros. He is celebrated for his versatile and innovative use of poetic meters, and is the earliest known Greek author to compose almost entirely on the theme of his own emotions and experiences.
