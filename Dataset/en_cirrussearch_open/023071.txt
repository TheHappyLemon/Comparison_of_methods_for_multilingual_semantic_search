The Russian Grand Prix (Russian: Гран-при России, romanized: Gran-pri Rossii) was an annual motor racing event held at Sochi Autodrom – a permanent circuit built around the Olympic Park in Sochi – as part of the Formula One World Championship. The race was first held briefly in the 1910s in Saint Petersburg of the Russian Empire. Plans were made to host a Formula One event in Moscow for the 1983 season as the Grand Prix of the Soviet Union scheduled for 21 August, but these plans fell through due to bureaucratic barriers. In 2010, it was announced that the Russian city of Sochi, which was also preparing to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, would host a new event on the Formula One calendar, beginning in 2014 under a seven-year deal. In 2021, a contract was signed with the intention of moving the event to Igora Drive (about 54 km (34 mi) north of Saint Petersburg) starting from 2023 onwards. Igora Drive, which was opened in 2019, was due to have an extension to the track built, taking the original layout from 4.086 km (2.539 mi) and 15 turns to 5.182 km (3.220 mi) and 19 turns in time for the 2023 race. The 2022 event was cancelled in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, before the contract for all future races was terminated also due to the invasion. The event is notable for having only ever been won by Mercedes during the race's establishment as a World Championship event.
