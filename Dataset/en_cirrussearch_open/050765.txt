ErAZ or Yerevanskiy Avtomobilny Zavod (Armenian: ԵրԱԶ or Երևանի ավտոմոբիլային գործարան, Russian: ЕрАЗ or Ереванский Автомобильный Завод, lit. 'Yerevan Automobile Plant'), was an Armenian automobile manufacturer in Yerevan, Armenia, mostly known for producing the van RAF-977K (as ErAZ-762) from 1966 to 1996.[unreliable source?] Plans to establish the ErAZ factory came about on December 31, 1964, by the Council of Ministers of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. The original staff were trained at the Riga Autobus Factory in Latvia and UAZ in Russia. ErAZ was privatized in 1995, and declared bankruptcy in 2002.
