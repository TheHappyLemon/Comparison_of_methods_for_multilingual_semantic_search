Holme Bay is a bay in Antarctica in Mac. Robertson Land, 22 miles (35 km) wide, containing many islands, indenting the coast 5 miles (8 km) north of the Framnes Mountains. Holme Bay is largely snow-free and was mapped by Norwegian cartographers from aerial photographs taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition in January-February 1937, and named Holmevika because of its island-studded character (holme means "islet" in Norwegian) .
