The Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2020 was the 18th edition of the annual Junior Eurovision Song Contest, organised by Telewizja Polska (TVP) and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The contest took place on 29 November 2020, and was held in Warsaw, Poland, following the country's victory at the 2019 contest with the song "Superhero" by Viki Gabor. This was the first time the contest was held in the same country for two consecutive years. Twelve countries participated in the contest, having the smallest number of participants since the 2013 contest (with some countries pointing the COVID-19 pandemic situation and the resulting travel restrictions as the reasons for their withdrawal), with Germany participating for the first time. France's Valentina was the winner of the contest with the song "J'imagine". This was France's first victory in the contest, as well as their first victory at a Eurovision event since Eurovision Young Dancers 1989. Kazakhstan and Spain finished in second and third place respectively for the second year in a row. The Netherlands and Belarus completed the top five, with the Netherlands finishing fourth also for the second year in a row. Debuting country Germany finished last.
