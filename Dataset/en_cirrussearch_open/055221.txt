The 1900 Summer Olympics took place in Paris, France. Two of the golf events that were contested in early October at the Compiègne Club, Compiègne as part of the Exposition Universelle, the men's and women's individual stroke play competitions, have since been afforded Olympic status. As such the 1900 games are recognised as the first time that golf was held in the Olympics.
