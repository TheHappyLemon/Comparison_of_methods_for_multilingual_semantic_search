An object database or object-oriented database is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. Object databases are different from relational databases which are table-oriented. A third type, objectâ€“relational databases, is a hybrid of both approaches. Object databases have been considered since the early 1980s.
