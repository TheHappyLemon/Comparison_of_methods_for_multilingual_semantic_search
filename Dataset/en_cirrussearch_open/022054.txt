The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) research project is an annual assessment of the national level of entrepreneurial activity in multiple, diverse countries. Today the study counts the participation of 115 countries and with longitudinal data dating back more than 20 years. The continuous expansion of its collaborative role has made GEM data a valuable tool to influence national economic policies and a quality resource trusted by international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
