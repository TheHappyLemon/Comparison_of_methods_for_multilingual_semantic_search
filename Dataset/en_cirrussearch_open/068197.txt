The 2023–24 UEFA Europa League is the 53rd season of Europe's secondary club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 15th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the UEFA Europa League. The final will be played at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. The winners of the tournament will automatically qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League group stage, and also earn the right to play against the winners of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League in the 2024 UEFA Super Cup, and the winners of the 2023 Copa Sudamericana in the 2024 UEFA–CONMEBOL Club Challenge. This edition will be the final season with the current format of 32 teams participating in the group stage, after UEFA announced that a brand new format would be introduced for the following edition. Due to the format change, no clubs can be transferred from the Champions League group stage to the UEFA Europa League under the Swiss format, and this edition's winners onwards will no longer be able to defend the title. Sevilla were the defending champions, but could not defend their title after being eliminated from European competition in the group stage of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League.
