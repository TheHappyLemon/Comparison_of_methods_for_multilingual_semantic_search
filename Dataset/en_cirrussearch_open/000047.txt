The Belarus women's national basketball (Belarusian: жаночая зборная Беларусі па баскетболе, Russian: женская сборная Белоруссии по баскетболу) represented Belarus in international women's basketball tournaments. The team is controlled by the Belarusian Basketball Federation. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the FIBA suspended Belarus from participating in basketball and 3x3 basketball competitions.
