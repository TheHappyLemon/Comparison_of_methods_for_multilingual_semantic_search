The Wandel Sea (Danish: Wandelhavet; also known as McKinley Sea) is a body of water in the Arctic Ocean, stretching from northeast of Greenland to Svalbard. It is obstructed by ice most of the year. This sea is named after Danish polar explorer and hydrographer, Vice Admiral Carl Frederick Wandel, who in the years 1895â€“96 explored the coastal waters of Greenland as part of the Danish Ingolf Expedition.
