Anna's Archive is a search engine for shadow libraries. It was founded by the Pirate Library Mirror, a team of anonymous archivists, in direct response to law enforcement efforts to close down Z-Library in 2022. It describes itself as a project that aims to "catalog all the books in existence" and to "track humanity's progress toward making all these books easily available in digital form".[dubious – discuss] Anna's Archive mirrors Library Genesis, Open Library, Sci-Hub and Z-Library. Anna's Archive says that it does not host copyrighted materials and that it only indexes metadata that is already publicly available. As of April 1, 2024[update], Anna's Archive includes 30,702,128 books and 99,901,919 papers.
