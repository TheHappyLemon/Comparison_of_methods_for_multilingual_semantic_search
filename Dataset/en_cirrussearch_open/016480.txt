UN Tourism (UNWTO until 2023) is a specialized agency of the United Nations which promotes responsible, sustainable and universally accessible tourism. Its headquarters are based in Madrid, Spain. Other offices include: a Regional Support Office for Asia and the Pacific in Nara, Japan and a Regional Office for West Asia in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. UN Tourism promotes tourism and serves as a global forum for tourism policy and a source of tourism research and knowledge. It encourages Competitiveness, Innovation, Education, Investments & Digital Transformation, Ethics, Culture & Social Responsibility, Technical Cooperation, UN Tourism Academy, and Statistics. The six official languages of UN Tourism are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. Before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism stood at an all-time high: 1 out of 10 jobs worldwide depended on tourism and international tourist arrivals reached 1.5 billion in 2019. Against a backdrop of heightened uncertainty, UN Tourism conveyed the Global Tourism Crisis Committee to guide the tourism sector as it faced up to the COVID-19 challenge. From its inception in 1975 until 2023, UN Tourism was called the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).
