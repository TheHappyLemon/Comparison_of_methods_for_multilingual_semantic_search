The men's ice hockey tournament at the 1968 Winter Olympics held in Grenoble, France, was the 11th Olympic Championship, also serving as the 35th World Championships and the 46th European Championships. This was the last Olympic tournament to include the World and European titles. Games were held at the Palais des Sports. The Soviet Union won their third Olympic gold medal, eighth World Championship and twelfth European Championship. Czechoslovakia won the silver, followed by Canada taking the bronze. For the first (and only) time, not all qualifiers were given the opportunity to play for medals, as the lowest two ranked qualifiers (Japan and Austria), together with host France were placed directly into the Consolation Group. Poland and Italy qualified but declined to participate.
