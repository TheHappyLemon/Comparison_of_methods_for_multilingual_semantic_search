Jermain Colin Defoe OBE (born 7 October 1982) is an English football coach and former professional player. He is the under-18s coach at Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. Defoe was a striker and began his career with Charlton Athletic, joining their youth team aged 14, before moving to West Ham United aged 16 and rising through the ranks. He made his first-team debut for West Ham in 2000 and, after a season-long loan spell at AFC Bournemouth during the 2000–01 season, established himself in the West Ham line-up. After West Ham's relegation in 2003, a move to Tottenham Hotspur in January 2004 soon followed, where Defoe played for four years before being sold to Portsmouth in January 2008. He spent one season at Fratton Park before returning to Tottenham in the January 2009 transfer window. He left for Toronto FC of Major League Soccer (MLS) in 2014, before returning to England in January 2015 to sign for Sunderland where he stayed until the club was relegated from the Premier League in 2017. Following a brief spell at AFC Bournemouth in 2017, Defoe joined Scottish side Rangers in 2018 on loan. The move was later made permanent. At his new club he was involved in winning the 2020–21 league title. This was the first and only league title in his career at the age of 38. In April 2011, Defoe became the 20th player to score a century of Premier League goals, and is currently the ninth-highest goalscorer in Premier League history as well as the sixth-highest goalscorer in Tottenham's history. Defoe also holds the Premier League record for the most goals scored as a substitute, with 24. On 19 November 2016, Defoe scored his 150th Premier League goal, becoming the joint tenth-highest goal scorer in Premier League history. Defoe debuted for the England national team in 2004, making 57 appearances and scoring 20 goals, including three appearances and a goal at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
