Heinz Jost (9 July 1904 – 12 November 1964) was a German SS functionary during the Nazi era. He was involved in espionage matters as the Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service) or (SD) section chief of office VI (foreign intelligence) of the Reich Security Main Office. Jost was responsible for genocide in eastern Europe as commander of Einsatzgruppe A from March–September 1942. After Germany's defeat, Jost was tried and convicted by a U.S. military court at the Einsatzgruppen trial. In December 1951, Jost was released from Landsberg Prison after his sentence was commuted to ten years and died in 1964.
