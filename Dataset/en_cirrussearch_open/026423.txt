Lorius is a genus of lory in the parrot family Psittaculidae. The genus contains six species that are distributed from the Moluccas in Indonesia through New Guinea to the Solomon Islands. They have characteristic red plumage with varying amounts of blue (and in some yellow and white), green wings, and in all but one species a black crown. The bills are orange and the feet are grey. With lengths of up to 25 to 30 cm (9.8 to 11.8 in) and average weights of 132 to 190 g (4.7 to 6.7 oz), the members of this genus tend to be the largest of the Loriinae subfamily.
