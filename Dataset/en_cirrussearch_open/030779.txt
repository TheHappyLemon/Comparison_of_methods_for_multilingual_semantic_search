Honken Trophy is awarded annually to the Swedish goaltender of the year, playing in Sweden (usually in the SHL), as decided on by Eventhouse and Kamratf√∂reningen Hockeyjournalisterna. It was installed in 2002 and resembles the Vezina Trophy of the NHL. The trophy is named in honour of goalie Leif "Honken" Holmqvist.
