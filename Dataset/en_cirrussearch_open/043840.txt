The Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF or FBK; Russian: Фонд борьбы с коррупцией (ФБК), romanized: Fond borby s korruptsiyey (FBK), lit. 'Foundation for combating corruption') is a non-profit organization established in 2011 by Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny. The FBK published investigations into alleged corruption by high-ranking Russian government officials. The organisation was funded by private donations. On 9 October 2019, the FBK was declared a "foreign agent" by the Russian Ministry of Justice. On 9 June 2021, the FBK was designated as an extremist organization and liquidated by the Moscow City Court. On 11 July 2022, while imprisoned, Navalny announced the relaunch of the FBK as an international organization.
