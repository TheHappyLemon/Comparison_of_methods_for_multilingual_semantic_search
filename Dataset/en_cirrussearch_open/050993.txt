The University of Trnava (in Trnava) (Slovak: Trnavská univerzita v Trnave) is based in Trnava, in the west of Slovakia. The university's presence in the town has historical antecedents as the University of Nagyszombat was operating there throughout the 17th and 18th century (present day Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest).
