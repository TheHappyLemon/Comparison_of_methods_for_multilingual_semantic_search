The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Qatar accepted the convention on September 12, 1984, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Qatar has only one World Heritage Site, Al Zubara Fort, which was inscribed in 2013.
