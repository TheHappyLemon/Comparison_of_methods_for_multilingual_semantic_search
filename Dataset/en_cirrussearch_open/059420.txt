The long jump was one of five equestrian competitions held in late May and early June 1900 at the International Horse Show in Paris. The event was part of the Exposition Universelle, and later classified as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics. It is the only Olympic Games to feature an equestrian long jump competition. Of the seventeen competitors who entered, around half are known by name. The event was won by Constant van Langhendonck of Belgium, with Gian Giorgio Trissino of Italy in second and Jacques de Prunel√© of France in third.
