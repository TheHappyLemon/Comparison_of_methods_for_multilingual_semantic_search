Feminnem is a girl group from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina composed of three members. They represented both countries at the Eurovision Song Contest; Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2005 (with original members Ivana Marić, Neda Parmać and Pamela Ramljak) and Croatia in 2010 (when the group consisted of Nika Antolos, Parmać and Ramljak). On 21 February 2012, Pamela, Neda and Nika decided to start solo careers and leave Feminnem and effectively disbanded the group. They were named after American rapper Eminem. In May 2022, the group were decided to get back together, and their members posted on social media announcement of their comeback.
