A viscount (/ˈvaɪkaʊnt/ VY-kownt, for male) or viscountess (/ˈvaɪkaʊntɪs/, for female) is a title used in certain European countries for a noble of varying status. The status and any domain held by a viscount is a viscountcy. In the case of French viscounts, the title is sometimes left untranslated as vicomte [vi.kɔ̃t].
