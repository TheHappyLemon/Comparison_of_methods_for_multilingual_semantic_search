Darren Barr Fletcher (born 1 February 1984) is a Scottish football coach and former professional player who is currently the technical director of Manchester United, where he spent the majority of his playing career and won 13 trophies including five Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League. He mostly played as a central midfielder, but began his career as a right winger and also featured occasionally in defence. Fletcher came through the ranks of Manchester United's Youth Academy and spent 20 years with United, making 342 appearances for the club. With them, he won five Premier Leagues, one FA Cup, two League Cups, four FA Community Shields, the FIFA Club World Cup and the UEFA Champions League. Fletcher was included in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year for 2009â€“10. He was named vice-captain in his last season with the club. He joined West Bromwich Albion in February 2015, where he made 97 appearances. After leaving Albion in 2017, Fletcher had a two-year stint with Stoke City. He returned to Manchester United in a coaching capacity in October 2020, working with the club's under-16s players, before being appointed to the first team in January 2021. In March 2021, he became technical director at Manchester United. Fletcher made his full international debut for Scotland in 2003, and scored his first international goal on his second appearance. The following year, he played as the team's youngest captain for over a century. After Barry Ferguson was banned from international football because of a breach of regulations, Fletcher was given the captaincy on a full-time basis in August 2009. In total he won 80 caps and scored 5 goals for Scotland. The middle of Fletcher's career was disrupted by an extended break from football due to health problems caused by ulcerative colitis. Between November 2011 and December 2013, he played only ten times for his club, undergoing an operation in early 2013 to lessen the effects of the condition after a failed return in September 2012.
