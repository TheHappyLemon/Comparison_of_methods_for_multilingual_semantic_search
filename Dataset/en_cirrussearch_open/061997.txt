Raymond Neal Clemence, MBE (5 August 1948 â€“ 15 November 2020) was an England international football goalkeeper and part of the Liverpool team of the 1970s. Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, he is one of few players to have made over 1,000 career appearances, and holds the record for the most clean sheets in the history of football (460). Winning three European Cups, five League titles, two UEFA Cups, a UEFA Super Cup, an FA Cup and a League Cup with Liverpool, the last of his 665 appearances for the club was the victorious 1981 European Cup Final. In 1981, after being phased out at Liverpool, Clemence joined Tottenham Hotspur, winning a UEFA Cup, an FA Cup, and a Charity Shield with them, before retiring from football in 1988. After brief spells as joint-manager at Tottenham (alongside Doug Livermore) and sole manager at Barnet in the first half of the 90s, he acted as head of the FA Development Team, overseeing the development made by players in the England youth teams from under-16 to 21 level, having previously been part of the England senior team's backroom staff.
