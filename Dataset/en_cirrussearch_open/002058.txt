No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls is the debut studio album by Canadian rock band Simple Plan. Formed by members of Reset, Simple Plan spent over a year recording their first album with producer Arnold Lanni. It is a pop-punk record that revolves around being an outcast, drawing comparisons to Blink-182, Good Charlotte and New Found Glory. After signing with major label Atlantic Records, "I'm Just a Kid" was released as a single in February 2002, with No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls following on March 19. It received a mixed reaction from music critics, with some commenting on the lack of originality and others praising the production. They promoted it with supporting slots for Sugar Ray, Blink-182, Green Day and short stint on Warped Tour. Between support slots for Good Charlotte and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, "I'd Do Anything" was released as a single. Preceded by the single release of "Addicted", the band supported Avril Lavigne, before appearing on Warped Tour again. Their fourth and final single "Perfect" was followed by radio festivals and a co-headlining tour with MxPx in early 2004.
