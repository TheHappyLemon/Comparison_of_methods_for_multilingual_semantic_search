Skanste is a neighbourhood located in the center of Riga, the capital of Latvia. Geographically, the neighborhood is situated in the northern part of the railway ring on the right bank of the Daugava, bordering the Sarkandaugava, Brasa, Centrs, and Pētersala-Andrejsala neighborhoods. Skanste is considered part of the compact center of Riga. The neighborhood's central traffic artery is Skanstes Street, but the area is delineated by Pulkveža Brieža, Hanzas, Vesetas, and Duntes streets, as well as Ganību dambis, and the railroad. The area that for decades was allotted for kitchen garden plots, has now been developed to include office towers, sports infrastructure complexes and residential buildings. Next to the historical heart of Riga and its so-called "quiet center", Skanste is developing as a contemporary neighborhood, attractive both to city residents and entrepreneurs and fosters Riga's competitiveness regionally and in the European context. Skanste continues to grow and there are several plans that will be implemented in the coming years. The Skanste neighborhood takes up 215 hectares (530 acres) measuring by perimeter, and its border is more than six kilometers (4 miles) long. Currently, more than 12,000 people live or work in Skanste, and if large-scale plans for the neighborhood are carried out, these numbers could exceed 42 thousand. On average, the Elektrum Olympic Center and Arena Riga receive 1.9 million visitors a year. When the Metta Youth Football Education Center, a multifunctional private clinic, the Riga Conference, the Concert Center and other projects come to fruition, the annual number of Skanste visitors will grow to 3 million people.
