Jacob Muzzin (born February 21, 1989) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played 12 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Los Angeles Kings and Toronto Maple Leafs. Originally drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, Muzzin went unsigned and returned to the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) as an overage player. There he served as team captain and won the Max Kaminsky Trophy as the top defenceman in the OHL. As a free agent, Muzzin signed with the Kings in 2010, winning a Stanley Cup with the team in 2014. Muzzin was traded to Toronto during the 2018â€“19 season, where he played parts of five seasons. After a spinal injury suffered in 2022 resulted in his placement on long-term injured reserve, Muzzin joined the Maple Leafs' front office as a professional scout in 2023. Internationally, he represented Canada at the 2015 IIHF World Championship and 2016 World Cup of Hockey, winning gold in both tournaments.
