Nicholas Bonino (born April 20, 1988) is an American professional ice hockey center who is an unrestricted free agent. He most recently played for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played for the Anaheim Ducks, Vancouver Canucks, Nashville Predators, Minnesota Wild, San Jose Sharks, and Pittsburgh Penguins. Bonino has represented the United States three times, winning a bronze medal twice. Prior to beginning his collegiate career at Boston University, Bonino was drafted in the sixth round, 173rd overall, in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft by the San Jose Sharks. However, his playing rights were later traded to the Anaheim Ducks before he could sign or play for the team. Bonino played three seasons with the Boston University Terriers before embarking on his professional career with the Ducks. Although he played with the HC Neumarkt-Egna during the 2012â€“13 NHL lockout, Bonino spent the majority of five years within the Ducks system before being traded to the Vancouver Canucks. His tenure with the Canucks spanned one season before he was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins. Bonino became a significant member of the Pittsburgh Penguins and played a huge factor in the Pittsburgh Penguins becoming the first back to back Stanley Cup champions of the salary cap era. His play in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs was a significant factor in the Pittsburgh Penguins winning the Stanley Cup as he led the team in assists. Along with his line mates Phil Kessel and Carl Hagelin, the trio was nicknamed the HBK line and noted for their strong play during the playoffs. After missing significant time during the Penguins 2017 Stanley Cup run due to an injury, Bonino left the Penguins as a free agent to sign with the Nashville Predators.
