Jean Siméon Chardin (French: [ʒɑ̃ simeɔ̃ ʃaʁdɛ̃]; November 2, 1699 – December 6, 1779) was an 18th-century French painter. He is considered a master of still life, and is also noted for his genre paintings which depict kitchen maids, children, and domestic activities. Carefully balanced composition, soft diffusion of light, and granular impasto characterize his work.
