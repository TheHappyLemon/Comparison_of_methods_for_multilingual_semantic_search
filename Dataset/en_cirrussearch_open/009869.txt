.tf is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the French Southern and Antarctic Lands. Along with .fr, .pm, .re, .wf and .yt it is administered by AFNIC. Before 23 October 2004, Adamsnames, based in Cambridge in the United Kingdom, administered this TLD. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands are territories either recognised as French or claimed by France but suspended under the Antarctic Treaty System, and the domain name derives from the French, Terres australes et antarctiques fran√ßaises. Part of the French claim includes a section of the continent of Antarctica, creating an overlap between .tf and the general Antarctica domain .aq.
