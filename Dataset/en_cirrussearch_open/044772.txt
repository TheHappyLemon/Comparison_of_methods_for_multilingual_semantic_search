Copper Mountain (a Club Med Experience) (also known as just Copper Mountain) is a 1983 Canadian comedy television film, written and directed by Damian Lee and David Mitchell, produced for CTV Television Network, that premiered on First Choice TV network. Starring Jim Carrey and Alan Thicke, it is a "thinly-veiled" quasi-commercial for the now-defunct Club Med ski resort in Copper Mountain, Colorado. The majority of the runtime consists of rom-com plot interspersed with performances by country and rock and roll musicians, Ronnie Hawkins, Rita Coolidge and Chicago frontman Bill Champlin, with whom TV theme song writer Thicke co-wrote the song "Sara".
