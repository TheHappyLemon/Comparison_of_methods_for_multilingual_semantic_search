Queen + Paul Rodgers (sometimes referred to as Q+PR or QPR) was a collaboration between Queen (Brian May and Roger Taylor) and Paul Rodgers, formerly of Bad Company, Free, The Firm and The Law. Guitarist May had previously performed with Rodgers on several occasions, including a performance at the Royal Albert Hall. After they first performed together at the 10 October 2004 induction of Queen to the UK Music Hall of Fame, it was made clear that Rodgers would not be replacing Queen's former lead singer, Freddie Mercury, who died on 24 November 1991, and instead, would simply be "featured with" past Queen members. Former Queen bass guitarist John Deacon declined to participate in the collaboration after having retired in 1997. The group's three principal members, May, Taylor and Rodgers, were supplemented on tour by Queen's former touring keyboard player, Spike Edney, rhythm guitarist Jamie Moses, and bass guitarist Danny Miranda, who had previously worked with Blue Ã–yster Cult. Throughout their career, the band completed two world tours, issued the first studio album for Queen in nearly 15 years entitled, The Cosmos Rocks, and released two live albums and three live DVDs. Rodgers announced in May 2009 that the Queen + Paul Rodgers collaboration had come to an end, saying, "it was never meant to be a permanent arrangement." He did, however, leave open the possibility for future collaborations. This collaboration was then followed by another collaboration, this time with Adam Lambert, called Queen + Adam Lambert.
