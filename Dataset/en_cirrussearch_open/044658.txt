FC Noah Jurmala (until 2021 — FC Lokomotiv Daugavpils, until 2019 — LDZ Cargo/DFA) is a defunct Latvian football club. They were based in the Latvian town of Jūrmala near Rīga and, most recently before the club's termination, competed in the highest division of Latvian football (the Virslīga) and the Latvian Football Cup. On 23 June 2021, the club's administration announced their departure from the Latvian Higher League and the termination of the club, as the Latvian Football Federation and the Latvian authorities began an investigation into match fixing allegations and illicit financial activity at the club, leading to a number of suspensions and convictions.
