Ogaden (pronounced and often spelled Ogadēn; Somali: Ogaadeen, Amharic: ውጋዴ/ውጋዴን) is one of the historical names used for the modern Somali Region which forms the eastern portion of Ethiopia and borders Somalia. Other names sometimes used for this area are Haud or Hawd. The region is an arid area, and encompasses the desolate plain between the border of Somalia and Ethiopia, extending towards the eastern Ethiopian Highlands where larger cities like Harar and Dire Dawa are located. The primary river in the region is the Shebelle, which is fed by temporary seasonal streams. Towards the southwestern edge of the Ogaden is the source of the Ganale Doria river which joins Dawa river to become the major Jubba) river on the Somali border. The region has a low population density and is predominantly inhabited by Somali people. The Ogaden is known for its oil and gas reserves, although development efforts have been hindered by the instability prevailing in the area.
