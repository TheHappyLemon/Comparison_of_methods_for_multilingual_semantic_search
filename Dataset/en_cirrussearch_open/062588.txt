The 20+ ton was a sailing event on the Sailing at the 1900 Summer Olympics program in Le Havre. The race was planned for 2 August 1900. However, as result of the storm that was unleashed on the port and the poor condition of the sea the race was postponed to Sunday 3 August 1900. 14 boats, from 4 nations registered for the competition. Due to the weather conditions only four of them started and finished the race. Originally this race was not a part of the Olympic competition but was part of the lâ€™Exposition universelle. Later it was incorporated in the Olympic history.
