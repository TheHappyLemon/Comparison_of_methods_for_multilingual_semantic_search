The Time of Our Lives is the first extended play (EP) by American recording artist Miley Cyrus. The EP was released on August 28, 2009 by Hollywood Records, initially as a Walmart exclusive in the United States. Most of the album was produced by John Shanks; Dr. Luke also produced. The Time of Our Lives was originally conceived as a release to accompany Cyrus' apparel line with Max Azria. Cyrus had fairly limited involvement in the composition of the release, only having writing credits on one track: a live version of the previously released Jonas Brothers collaboration, "Before the Storm". The Time of Our Lives received generally positive reactions from critics, with some reviews suggesting that the EP was an effective step into adulthood for Cyrus. Some reviews were critical of the ballads which appear on the record, however. The EP was a commercial success, charting within the top ten in nine countries. In the United States, The Time of Our Lives peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Moreover, the EP had success internationally, peaking at number three in Greece, number five in Austria, and number six in Spain. Two singles were released from The Time of Our Lives. The lead single, "Party in the U.S.A.", became Cyrus' best-selling effort up to that point, peaking at number two in the Billboard Hot 100. It also became one of the best-selling singles in the United States and Hollywood Records' best- and fastest-selling single. The second and final single released from the EP was "When I Look at You". It was used to promote the 2010 film The Last Song, which Cyrus starred in. Unable to match the success of "Party in the U.S.A.", the single peaked within the top twenty in Australia and the United States. In late 2009, Cyrus embarked on her first world tour, the Wonder World Tour, to promote the EP.
