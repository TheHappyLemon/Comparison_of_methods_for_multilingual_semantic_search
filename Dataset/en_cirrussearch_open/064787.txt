The 47th annual Toronto International Film Festival was held from September 8 to 18, 2022. The 2022 festival was staged primarily in-person; a small selection of films were offered on the Digital TIFF Bell Lightbox platform, but this represented a much smaller proportion of the overall lineup than in 2020 and 2021. The festival also saw the return of its networking and gala events, which were also suspended or held virtually in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto. As of mid-July, the festival had diverged from its usual practice of releasing a list of ten or twenty films to start its programming announcements, and instead issued a number of single-film announcements, before finally releasing its first extended list of the full gala and special presentations programs on July 28. Additional films were announced throughout August, until the full schedule was released on August 23. Festival CEO Cameron Bailey indicated that the full lineup would comprise around 200 feature films and about 40 short films, the largest lineup the festival has booked since the pre-pandemic 2019 edition. Sally El Hosaini's The Swimmers was the opening film, and the closing film was Mary Harron's Dal√≠land. The Fabelmans, which screened as a special presentation and won the People's Choice Award, marked the first time in history that a Steven Spielberg film premiered at the festival. Jordan Peele's Nope, although already released in theaters prior to the festival, was also screened in IMAX at the Cinesphere as a special presentation in the main festival slate. The festival also indicated that in light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, state-backed Russian films and organizations would be banned from the festival, although participation by independent Russian filmmakers would still be permitted. In 2023, festival organizers announced that the 2022 festival had returned to levels of in-person attendance comparable to the festivals prior to 2020.
