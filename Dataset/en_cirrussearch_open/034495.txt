The 25th Chess Olympiad (German: Die 25. Schacholympiade), organized by FIDE and comprising an open and a women's tournament, as well as several other events designed to promote the game of chess, took place between October 29 and November 16, 1982, in Lucerne, Switzerland. The Soviet team with three world champions (reigning champion Karpov, future champion Kasparov and former champion Tal) were back in their usual form and this time left no doubt about the outcome. In the end, they only drew one match (against the Netherlands; and won the rest) and finished no less than 6½ points ahead of runners-up Czechoslovakia. The United States took the bronze medals. Off the board, FIDE elected a new president at its congress held concurrently with the Olympiad. Friðrik Ólafsson of Iceland was succeeded by Florencio Campomanes of the Philippines.
