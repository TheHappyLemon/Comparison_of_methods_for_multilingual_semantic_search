.pr is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Puerto Rico. A .pr.us second-level domain has been reserved for Puerto Rico under the .us locality namespace, but it is unused. Agencies of the government of Puerto Rico use either .gov.pr or, more recently, subdomains of pr.gov, where the main government portal is located. In March 2010, National Public Radio launched a URL shortener using the domain hack "n.pr".
