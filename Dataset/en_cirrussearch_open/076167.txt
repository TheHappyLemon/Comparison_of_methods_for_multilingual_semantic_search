The VAZ-2103 Zhiguli is a deluxe compact sedan car (small class, passenger car, model 3 in the Soviet classification), produced by VAZ, introduced in 1972 and produced until 1984. Better known by its export name Lada 1500 outside of its native Soviet Union and popularly nicknamed the Troika (Russian: Тройка, lit. 'three') in its domestic market. The car was developed jointly by VAZ and FIAT at the same time as Fiat 124 Special, and the two models had the same basis and influenced each other. 2103 was built under license and tailored for the Soviet and Eastern European market. The 2103 externally differs from its predecessor, the VAZ-2101 firstly by its four, that is, double sets of headlights, different grille and direction pointers, moldings on the sides of the body and larger taillights. Its main difference - the more powerful 75 hp (55 kW) 1,452 cc (88.6 cu in) straight-four petrol engine. In addition, this model is distinguished by the presence of vacuum brake booster as well as self-adjusting rear brakes and internally on the new, Fiat 125 based front panel. The interior was also more upmarket with a different steering wheel, cloth interior trim on export versions (in place of the VAZ-2101's vinyl) and improved dashboard featuring wood imitation, tachometer, oil pressure gauge and front panel clock.
