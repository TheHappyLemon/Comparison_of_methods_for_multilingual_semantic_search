Troilus luridus, also known as the bronze shieldbug, is a species of shield bug found in Europe. It was first described by the Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775. Shieldbugs are generally phytophagous (i.e., feeding on plant sap) and some, including Troilus luridus, are also carnivorous and will eat the larvae of beetles, lepidoptera and sawflies.
