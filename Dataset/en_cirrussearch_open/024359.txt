Arena Corinthians, also known as the Neo Química Arena for sponsorship reasons, is a sports stadium located in São Paulo, Brazil, owned, operated and used by Corinthians. It has a seating capacity of 47,252, making it the fifth-largest stadium used by teams in the top tier of the Brazilian League and the fourteenth-largest in Brazil. It hosted six matches during the 2014 FIFA World Cup, including the opening match on 12 June 2014. Because of a requirement for it to have at least 65,000 seats for the World Cup opening match, temporary seats were added to the stadium for the tournament. The temporary seats started to be removed shortly after its last World Cup match.
