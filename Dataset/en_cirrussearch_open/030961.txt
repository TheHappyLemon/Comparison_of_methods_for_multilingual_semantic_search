Static meshes are polygon meshes which constitute a major part of map architecture in many game engines, including Unreal Engine, Source, and Unity. The word "static" refers only to the fact that static meshes can't be vertex animated, as they can be moved, scaled, or reskinned in real-time. Static Meshes can create more complex shapes than CSG (the other major part of map architecture) and are faster to render per triangle.
