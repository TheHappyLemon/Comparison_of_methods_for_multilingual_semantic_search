Further Down the Spiral is a remix album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. It is the companion remix disc to the bandâ€™s second studio album, The Downward Spiral, and was released on May 29, 1995, in two editions, one denoted as Halo 10 (released in the United States), and the other as Halo 10 V2 (released in Japan, Australia, and the UK), each containing a different set of tracks. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 26, 1996, denoting sales in excess of 500,000 copies in the US. It has since become one of the best selling remix albums of all time. Further Down the Spiral showed a more varied and experimental point of view to the original[citation needed] and boasted many high-profile remixers and contributors including Aphex Twin, Coil with Danny Hyde, JG Thirlwell, Rick Rubin with Dave Navarro. The discs include remixes of "Mr. Self Destruct", "Piggy", "Hurt", "Eraser", "The Downward Spiral", "Heresy", "Reptile", and "Ruiner", as well as two original compositions by Aphex Twin.
