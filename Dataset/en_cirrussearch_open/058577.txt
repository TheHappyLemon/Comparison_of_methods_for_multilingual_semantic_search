The Crimea Platform (Ukrainian: Кримська платформа, romanized: Krymska platforma; Crimean Tatar: Qırım Platforması) is a diplomatic summit initiated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in August 2021 and attended by delegations from 46 countries. It is designed to be an international coordination mechanism to restore Russia–Ukraine relations by means of reversing the 2014 annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. The protection of the human rights of Crimean Tatars, environmental degradation and the stifling of trade in the Black and Azov Sea region are also matters discussed at the summit. The inaugural summit of the platform took place on 23 August 2021, on the eve of the 30th anniversary of Ukrainian independence.
