The House of the Devil is a 2009 American horror film written, directed, and edited by Ti West, starring Jocelin Donahue, Tom Noonan, Mary Woronov, Greta Gerwig, A. J. Bowen, and Dee Wallace. The plot concerns a young college student who is hired as a babysitter at an isolated house and is soon caught up in bizarre and dangerous events as she fights for her life. The film combines elements of both the slasher film and haunted house subgenres while using the "satanic panic" of the 1980s as a central plot element. It pays homage to the style of horror movies of the 1970s and 80s by using filmmaking techniques and technology commonly employed at the time. Opening text claims that the film is based upon true events, a practice used in horror movies such as The Amityville Horror and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.
