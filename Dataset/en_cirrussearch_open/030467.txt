The Narodniks (Russian: народники, romanized: narodniki, pronounced [nɐˈrodʲnʲɪkʲɪ]) were members of a movement of the Russian Empire intelligentsia in the 1860s and 1870s, some of whom became involved in revolutionary agitation against tsarism. Their ideology, known as Narodism, Narodnism or Narodnichestvo (Russian: народничество; from народ (narod) 'people, folk', similar to the German volk), was a form of agrarian socialism though it is often misunderstood as populism. The khozhdeniye v narod (хождение в народ; meaning 'going to the people') campaigns were the central impetus of the Narodnik movement. The Narodniks were in many ways the intellectual and political forebears and, in notable cases, direct participants of the Russian Revolution—in particular of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, which went on to greatly influence Russian history in the early 20th century.
