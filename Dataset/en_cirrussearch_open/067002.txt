The Roman Legion (Greek: Ρωμαϊκή Λεγεώνα, romanized: Romaïkí Legeóna), also known as the Vlach Legion (Greek: Βλάχικη Λεγεώνα, romanized: Vláchiki Legeóna) in later bibliography, was a pro-Axis political and paramilitary organization active in Greece in 1941–1942, in the regions of Thessaly and Macedonia. It was created by Alcibiades Diamandi, an Aromanian (Vlach) from Samarina (Samarina, Xamarina or San Marina) who served as an agent of Italy and Romania. The Roman Legion initially had around 2,000 members, and was supported by a small part of the local Aromanians. It consisted of the dregs of the local population, such as former criminals. It was dissolved in 1942.
