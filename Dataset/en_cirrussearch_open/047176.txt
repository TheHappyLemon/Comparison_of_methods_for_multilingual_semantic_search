MONEYVAL is the official denomination of the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism. It is a permanent monitoring body of the Council of Europe with 35 member states and jurisdictions out of which 32 are assessed exclusively by MONEYVAL.[1] According to Article 2 of its Statute, evaluations cover member states of the Council of Europe which are not members of the FATF (28 states). Through decisions of the Council of Europeâ€™s Committee of Ministers, two non-member states of the Council of Europe are also members (Israel, the Holy See), as well as several territories for whose international relations the United Kingdom is responsible (the United Kingdom Crown Dependencies of Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey; as well as the United Kingdom Overseas Territory of Gibraltar). The evaluation process is based on the Financial Action Task Force model and standards and is based on several rounds. MONEYVAL is now completing its 5th round of evaluations. In the Council of Europe MONEYVAL is part of the Directorate General of Human Rights and Rule of Law (DG1), and it is entrusted with the task of assessing the compliance with the principal international standards, to counter money laundering (ML) and terrorism financing (TF) and the effectiveness of their implementation. In the context of its mutual evaluation reports, MONEYVAL makes recommendations to the national authorities in respect of the necessary improvements to improve their systems.
