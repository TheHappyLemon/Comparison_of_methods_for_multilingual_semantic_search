The kuna (Croatian pronunciation: [kǔːna]; sign: kn; code: HRK) was the currency of Croatia from 1994 until 2022. It was replaced by the euro in 2023. The kuna was subdivided into 100 lipa. It was issued by the Croatian National Bank and the coins were minted by the Croatian Mint. In Croatian, the word kuna means "marten" and lipa means "linden (lime) tree", both references to their historical use in medieval trading.
