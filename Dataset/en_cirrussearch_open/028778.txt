Sex assignment (also known as gender assignment) is the discernment of an infant's sex, usually at birth. Based on an inspection of the baby's external genitalia by a relative, midwife, nurse, or physician, sex is assigned without ambiguity in 99.95% of births. In the remaining cases (1 in 2000), additional diagnostic steps are required and sex assignment is deferred. Sex also may be determined prior to birth through prenatal sex discernment. The number of births where the baby is intersex—where their sex characteristics do not fit typical definitions of male and female—is estimated to be between 0.018% and 1.7%. While some intersex conditions can lead to genital ambiguity (about 0.02% to 0.05% of births), in others genitalia can clearly be identified as either male or female. In the latter cases, an intersex condition might not be recognized at birth. Generally, parents and society, as well as governments and healthcare systems, assume that a person's gender identity will develop according to the sex assigned at birth; this is known as being cisgender. While this is the case for a majority of people, for a significant number assigned sex and gender identity do not align; this is known as being transgender. The sex assignment of an intersex individual may also contradict their future gender identity. If available, knowledge about the gender identity that a majority of people with the specific intersex condition develop is considered in sex assignment. Assignments might later be adjusted as a person grows up. Reinforcing sex assignments through surgical or hormonal interventions without informed consent is considered by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to violate the individual's human rights.
