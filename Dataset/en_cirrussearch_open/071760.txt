The Belarusian minority in Poland (Belarusian: Беларусы ў Польшчы, romanized: Biełarusy w Polščy; Polish: Białorusini w Polsce) is composed of 47,000 people according to the Polish census of 2011. This number decreased in the last decades from over 300,000 due to an active process of assimilation. Most of them live in the Podlaskie Voivodeship. A small but unconfirmed Belarusian population remains in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in western Poland. They may be assimilated into the Polish population, but Belarusian culture has not firmly disappeared in the whole of Poland since World War II.[citation needed]
