Lake Agassiz (/ˈæɡəsi/ AG-ə-see) was a large proglacial lake that existed in central North America during the late Pleistocene, fed by meltwater from the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet at the end of the last glacial period. At its peak, the lake's area was larger than all of the modern Great Lakes combined. First postulated in 1823 by William H. Keating, it was named by Warren Upham in 1879 after Louis Agassiz, the then-recently deceased (1873) founder of glaciology, when Upham recognized that the lake was formed by glacial action.
