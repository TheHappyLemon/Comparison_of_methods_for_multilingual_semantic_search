Hendrik Brugt Gerhard Casimir ForMemRS (15 July 1909 â€“ 4 May 2000) was a Dutch physicist who made significant contributions to the field of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. He is best known for his work on the Casimir effect, which describes the attractive force between two uncharged plates in a vacuum due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Hendrik Casimir is also known for his research on the two-fluid model of superconductors (together with C. J. Gorter) in 1934.
