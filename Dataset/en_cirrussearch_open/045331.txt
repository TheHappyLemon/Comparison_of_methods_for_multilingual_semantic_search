Timo Meier ([ˈtiːmo ˈmaɪ̯ɐ] TEE-moh MY-er, born 8 October 1996) is a Swiss professional ice hockey player for the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League (NHL). After being selected ninth overall by the San Jose Sharks in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, Meier became the third Swiss player in franchise history to be drafted by the team. Growing up in Herisau, Switzerland, Meier began playing ice hockey at a young age. At the age of 15, he accepted an apprenticeship position with the SC Rapperswil-Jona Lakers, a National A League team in Switzerland, where he observed and learned from David Aebischer and Jason Spezza. After completing the 2012–13 season in his native Switzerland with the U17 SC Rapperswil-Jona Lakers, Meier was selected 12th overall by the Halifax Mooseheads in the 2013 Canadian Hockey League Import Draft. Meier spent three seasons with the Mooseheads before being traded to the Rouyn–Noranda Huskies to complete his major junior ice hockey career. Despite impressing the Sharks' coaching staff during their 2016 training camp, an illness held off Meier's NHL debut until 16 December. Following his NHL debut, Meier remained in the Sharks' lineup and he continued to impress the Sharks' coaching staff with his play. On 17 January 2022, Meier became the first player in Sharks franchise history to score five goals in one game. After seven seasons with San Jose, Meier was traded to New Jersey in 2023. Internationally, Meier has played for the Swiss national team at two World Championships, winning a silver medal in 2018.
