The Dunc Gray Velodrome is an Australian velodrome located at Bass Hill approximately 5 kilometres north west of the Sydney suburb of Bankstown. The cycling venue for the 2000 Summer Olympics, the Dunc Gray Velodrome was opened on 28 November 1999 with an opening ceremony which included performances by local talent Darren Sharp and other community groups. The Velodrome is named after Dunc Gray, the first Australian to win a cycling gold medal at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 1932. At the time of its construction, the State Government owned the velodrome. Bankstown Council managed the velodrome under a sublease. In 1998, the council sublet the velodrome to Bankstown Sports Club, under a 21-year sublease. The council resumed control of the velodrome in 2019.
