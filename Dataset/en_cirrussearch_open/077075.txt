Nicknamed "Geno", Malkin began his career with his hometown club Metallurg Magnitogorsk, playing for their junior and senior teams.

In his second season, he helped lead Pittsburgh to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals and was a runner-up for the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the NHL's most valuable player during the regular season. The following season saw Malkin win the Art Ross Trophy, awarded to the points leader in the NHL and again place second for the Hart Trophy. He and the Penguins again reached the Stanley Cup Finals, winning the Stanley Cup championship this time around. Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player of the playoffs. In 2012, Malkin was awarded the Hart Trophy and Ted Lindsay Award, awarded to the best player as voted on by the players, after winning the Art Ross Trophy for the second time; his 12-point lead was the largest margin of victory since 1999. Internationally, Malkin has competed for Russia in two IIHF World U18 Championships and three World Junior Championships, capturing one gold, two silvers and one bronze medal, as a junior. In 2006, he was named tournament MVP. As a senior, he has played in four IIHF World Championships, winning gold twice and being named the tournament MVP for the 2012 event.
