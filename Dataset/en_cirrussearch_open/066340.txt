The karbovanets or karbovanet (Ukrainian: карбованець, romanized: karbovanets, plural: карбованці, karbovantsi for 2–4, or карбованців, karbovantsiv for 5 or more), also known as kupon (Ukrainian: купон, romanized: kupon, plural: купони, kupony) or coupon, has been a distinct unit of currency in Ukraine during three separate periods of the 20th century. It is also a predecessor currency of today's Ukrainian hryvnia. The karbovanets was subdivided into one hundred kopiykas, but no denominations in kopiykas have ever been issued. In the ISO 4217 standard, the official name is spelled as karbovanet, while English version of the National Bank of Ukraine's website refers to it as karbovanets.
