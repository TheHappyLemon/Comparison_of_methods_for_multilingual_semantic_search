Skúgvoy (/ˈskʉuːwɪ/ or Skúvoy Faroese pronunciation: [ˈskɪkvɪ], Danish: Skuø) is an island in the central Faroe Islands, located to the south of Sandoy. It is named after the large number of great skua present on the island (who have a habit of attacking intruders). There is only one settlement on the island: Skúvoy on the east coast. There are two mountains: Knúkur (392 m) and Heyggjurin Mikli (391 m).
