One fencer of Persian nationality competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, thereby making him the first Olympic competitor for Persia (Iran), and the only one to compete in the Qajar dynasty. It would not be until the Pahlavi dynasty and the 1948 Summer Olympics that the nation sent a team to compete at the Olympic Games.
