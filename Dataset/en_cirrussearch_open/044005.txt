The 2016 European Athletics Championships was held in Amsterdam, Netherlands, between 6 and 10 July 2016. It was the first time the Netherlands hosted the event. Due to 2016 being an Olympic year, there was no racewalking and the marathon competition was replaced by half marathon. The Russian team did not participate due to the suspension of the All-Russia Athletic Federation by the International Association of Athletics Federations. However, Yuliya Stepanova was individually cleared by the IAAF to compete as an independent athlete; she participated in the European championships under the flag of the European Athletic Association. Germany and Great Britain topped the medal table with 16, with Poland winning 12 medals. Poland won and topped the victory column with 6 gold medals (Germany & Great Britain tied with 5).
