Barentsburg (Russian: Баренцбург) is the second-largest settlement in Svalbard, Norway, with about 455 inhabitants (2020[update]). A coal mining town, the settlement was almost entirely made up of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians. With the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, most of the Ukrainian citizens were reported to have left.
