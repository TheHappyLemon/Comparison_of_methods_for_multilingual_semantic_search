Flacourtia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Salicaceae. It was previously placed in the now defunct family Flacourtiaceae. The generic name honors Étienne de Flacourt (1607–1660), a governor of Madagascar. It contains 23 species of shrubs and small trees that are native to the African and Asian tropics and subtropics. Several species, especially Flacourtia indica, are cultivated as ornamentals and for their fruits. The trunks of small trees are often guarded by branching spines.[citation needed]
