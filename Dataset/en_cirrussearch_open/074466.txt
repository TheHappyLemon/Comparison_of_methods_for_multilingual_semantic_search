Peugeot (UK: /ˈpɜːʒoʊ/ , US: /p(j)uːˈʒoʊ/ , French: [pøʒo] ) is a French brand of automobiles owned by Stellantis. The family business that preceded the current Peugeot companies was founded in 1810, is regarded as the oldest car company in the world. On 20 November 1858, Émile Peugeot applied for the lion trademark. Armand Peugeot (1849–1915) built the company's first car steam tricycle. They joined forces with Léon Serpollet in 1886; this was followed in 1890 by an internal combustion car with a Panhard-Daimler engine. The Peugeot company and family are originally from Sochaux. Peugeot retains a large manufacturing plant and Peugeot museum there. In February 2014, the shareholders agreed to a recapitalisation plan for the PSA Group, in which Dongfeng Motors and the French government each bought a 14% stake in the company. Peugeot has received many international awards for its vehicles, including six European Car of the Year awards. Peugeot has also been successfully involved in motorsport for more than a century, including victories at the Indianapolis 500 in 1913, 1916, and 1919.
