The Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM; lit.â€‰'Party of the Revolution' in English) is the dominant ruling party in Tanzania and the second longest-ruling party in Africa, only after the True Whig Party of Liberia. It was formed in 1977, following the merger of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) and the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP), which were the sole operating parties in mainland Tanzania and the semi-autonomous islands of Zanzibar, respectively. TANU and its successor CCM have ruled Tanzania uninterruptedly since independence. The party has been described as authoritarian. Since the creation of a multi-party system, CCM has won the past six general elections in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020. Jakaya Kikwete, its presidential candidate in 2005, won by a landslide, receiving more than 80% of the popular vote and John Magufuli as a candidate in 2020 garnered over 84% of the vote. In the 2010 election, the CCM won 186 of the 239 constituencies, continuing to hold an outright majority in the National Assembly.
