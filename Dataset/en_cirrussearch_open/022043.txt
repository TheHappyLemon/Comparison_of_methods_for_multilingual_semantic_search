Lamata or Lamata Land is an ancient territory of Baltic tribes within modern West Lithuania near the Curonian Lagoon. The area is tentatively identified by the major population centers Šilutė, Priekulė and Švėkšna, although the hillforts identified with Lamata are located as far to the northwest as Mataičiai [lt] and by Versmininkai [lt] westwards of Šilutė. Some archeologists, starting with Adolfas Tautavičius, identify it as a separate ethnocultural entity and describe the area as a "microregion", while others, including Marija Gimbutas and Gintautas Zabiela [lt] disagree with the theory of Tautavičius and attribute the land to Scalvians or Western Samogitians.
