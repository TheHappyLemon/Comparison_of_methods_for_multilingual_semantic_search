The Ghost of Kyiv (Ukrainian: Привид Києва, romanized: Pryvyd Kyieva, pronounced [ˈprɪʋɪd ˈkɪjeʋɐ]) is the nickname given to a mythical MiG-29 Fulcrum flying ace credited with shooting down six Russian planes over Kyiv during the Kyiv offensive on 24 February 2022. Various reports, including the Security Service of Ukraine, made similar claims. The Ghost of Kyiv has been credited as a morale booster for Ukrainians during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Two months after the story spread, the Ukrainian Air Force acknowledged that the fighter was a myth, and warned people not to "neglect the basic rules of information hygiene" and to "check the sources of information, before spreading it". Experts have stated that stories such as Ghost of Kyiv are part of Ukrainian propaganda or a morale-boosting campaign, or potentially both.
