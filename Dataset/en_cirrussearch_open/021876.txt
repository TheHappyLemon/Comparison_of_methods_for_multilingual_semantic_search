The Chechens (/ˈtʃɛtʃɛnz, tʃəˈtʃɛnz/ CHETCH-enz, chə-CHENZ; Chechen: Нохчий, Noxçiy, Old Chechen: Нахчой, Naxçoy), historically also known as Kisti and Durdzuks, are a Northeast Caucasian ethnic group of the Nakh peoples native to the North Caucasus. They are the largest ethnic group in the region and refer to themselves as Nokhchiy (pronounced [no̞xtʃʼiː]; singular Nokhchi, Nokhcho, Nakhchuo or Nakhtche). The vast majority of Chechens are Muslims and live in Chechnya, an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation. The North Caucasus has been invaded numerous times throughout history. Its isolated terrain and the strategic value outsiders have placed on the areas settled by Chechens has contributed much to the Chechen community ethos and helped shape its national character. Chechen society is largely egalitarian and organized around tribal autonomous local clans, called teips.
