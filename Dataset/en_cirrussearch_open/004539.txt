Ole Christensen Rømer (Danish: [ˈoːlə ˈʁœˀmɐ]; 25 September 1644 – 19 September 1710) was a Danish astronomer who, in 1676, made the first measurement of the speed of light and discovery that light travels at a finite speed. Rømer also invented the modern thermometer showing the temperature between two fixed points, namely the points at which water respectively boils and freezes. Rømer measured the speed of light to be approximately 220,000 kilometers per second while working at the Royal Observatory in Paris. Rømer made this approximation while he was conducting studies of Jupiter's moon Io. As of the 21st century, the speed of light has been measured to be just under 300,000 kilometers per second. In scientific literature, alternative spellings such as "Roemer", "Römer", or "Romer" are common.
