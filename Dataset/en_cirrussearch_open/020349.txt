Demi is the fourth studio album by American singer Demi Lovato. It was released on May 10, 2013, by Hollywood Records. Looking to transition from her self-described "generic" third album Unbroken (2011), Lovato wanted her fourth album to "have songs that excited her". Demi is primarily a pop record with elements of synthpop, and bubblegum pop. Demi received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented Lovato's vocal performance. The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 110,000 copies, and has been certified 2× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album also reached the top five in Canada, Ireland, Italy, Mexico and Spain. The album's lead single, "Heart Attack" peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Lovato's third US top-ten single, and has been certified 5× platinum by the RIAA. The second single "Made in the USA" peaked at number 80 and was certified gold, while later singles "Neon Lights" and "Really Don't Care" both reached the top 40 peaking at 36 and 26, respectively, and both have been certified 2× platinum by RIAA. Lovato supported the album in two concert tours: The Neon Lights Tour in early 2014 and the Demi World Tour between late 2014 and early 2015.
