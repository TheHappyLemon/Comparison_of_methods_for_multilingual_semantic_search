The Other Russia of E. V. Limonov (Russian: Другая Россия Э. В. Лимонова, romanized: Drugáya Rossíya E. V. Limónova), formerly The Other Russia (Russian: Другая Россия, romanized: Drugáya Rossíya), is an unregistered National Bolshevik political party in Russia, founded on 10 July 2010 by Eduard Limonov. The Other Russia was reorganized in September 2020 and changed its name to "The Other Russia of E. V. Limonov", in honor of their deceased founder who had died the same year. As a Russian political party adopting syncretic politics, it has been variously called far-left and far-right by the likes of Malaysia's The Sun, France's Le Point, and BFM TV, Belgian's RTBF, and Eurasia Daily Monitor and the Czech Republic's Expactz.cz, respectively.
