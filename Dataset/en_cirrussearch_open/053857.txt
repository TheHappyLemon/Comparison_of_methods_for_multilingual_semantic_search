Henri Louis Hérouin, Sr. (19 February 1876 in Congis-sur-Thérouanne – 6 January 1926 in Pomponne) was a French competitor in the sport of archery. Hérouin won the first prize, and is now considered by the International Olympic Committee to have won the gold medal[1], in the 50 metre Au Cordon Doré event at the first Olympic appearance of archery, in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. His score of 31 put him 2 points above his closest competitor Hubert Van Innis. Hérouin also beat van Innis in the Championnat du Monde event, 22-16. This event is not considered Olympic by the IOC.
