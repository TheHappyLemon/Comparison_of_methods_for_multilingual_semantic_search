Canal 13 is a Chilean free-to-air television channel. Informally known in Chile as El 13 (The Thirteen), it is the second oldest television station in the country. It was launched on 21 August 1959, on VHF channel 2 of Santiago, in a broadcast led and founded by a group of engineers from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Subsequently, the TV station moved its frequency to VHF channel 13, which gave rise to its current name. In its beginnings, one of its most important milestones was the broadcast of the 1962 FIFA World Cup, which was hosted in Chile. It was originally named Corporación de Televisión de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (Television Corporation of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile) until 2010, when the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile sold most of its shares to Andrónico Luksic Craig's Grupo Luksic [es]. In 2017, Grupo Luksic acquired full ownership of the channel. Its central studios are located in the Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte Television Centre, which since the 1980s has housed the channel's production and broadcast facilities. The complex is located in Providencia, Santiago Metropolitan Region and has 5 hectares of infrastructure. Since 1998, these dependencies have been named after the station's deceased executive director, Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte, who was one of the longest-serving men in this position.
