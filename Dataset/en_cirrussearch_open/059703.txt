B'nai B'rith International (/bəˌneɪ ˈbrɪθ/ bə-NAY BRITH; from Hebrew: בְּנֵי בְּרִית, romanized: b'né brit, lit. 'Children of the Covenant') is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit Jewish service organization and was formerly a German Jewish cultural association. B'nai B'rith states that it is committed to the security and continuity of the Jewish people and the State of Israel and combating antisemitism and other forms of bigotry. Although the organization's historic roots stem from a system of fraternal lodges and units in the late 19th century, as fraternal organizations declined throughout the United States, the organization evolved into a dual system of both lodges and units. The membership pattern became more common to other contemporary organizations of members affiliated by contribution in addition to formal dues paying members. B'nai B'rith has members, donors and supporters around the world.
