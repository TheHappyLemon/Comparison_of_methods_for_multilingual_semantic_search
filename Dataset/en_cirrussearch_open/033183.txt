Bulgaria has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 14 times since making its debut at the 2005 contest in Kyiv. The country's best result is a second-place finish for Kristian Kostov and the song "Beautiful Mess" at the 2017 contest also in Kyiv. Bulgaria has failed to qualify for the final in 9 out of 14 appearances at the contest, most narrowly in 2012, when Sofi Marinova lost out on the 10th qualifying place from the second semi-final in a tie-break with Norway. However, on three of the five occasions that they have reached the final, they have finished in the top five: placing fifth with Elitsa and Stoyan in 2007, fourth with Poli Genova in 2016 and second with Kristian Kostov in 2017. In Bulgaria's two most recent final appearances, supergroup Equinox placed 14th in 2018 and Victoria placed 11th in 2021.
