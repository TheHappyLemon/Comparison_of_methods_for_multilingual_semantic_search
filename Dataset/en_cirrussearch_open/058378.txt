The European Athletics Indoor Championships is a biennial indoor track and field competition for European athletes that is organised by the European Athletic Association. It was held for the first time in 1970, replacing the European Indoor Games, its predecessor event first held in 1966. The championships was an annual event until 1990, when it was changed to its current biennial format. A gap of three years occurred after the 2002 edition to synchronize the event with the other major championships of international athletics. The event is hosted by a different European city each year.
