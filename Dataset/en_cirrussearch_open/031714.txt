The Giro dell'Emilia is a late season road bicycle race held annually in Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. Since 2005, the race has been organised as a 1.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour, and since 2020 it's part of the UCI ProSeries calendar. The race starts from Bologna, it generally takes a tour of Appennino Tosco-Emiliano National Park and ends in Bologna with 5 reps on the brutal climbing ring (Orfanelle climb, Montalbano climb and Casaglia downhill) of Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca. It is considered[by whom?] one of the most important and historical classic bicycle races of the calendar, the palmarès shows great champions like Coppi, Bartali, Merckx and Roglič.
