Danes Island (Norwegian: Danskøya) is an island in Norway's Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean with an area of 40.6 km2 (15.7 sq mi). It lies just off the northwest coast of Spitsbergen, the largest island in the archipelago, near to Magdalenefjorden. Just to the north lies Amsterdam Island. Most of Svalbard's islands, including Danes Island, are uninhabited; only Spitsbergen, Bjørnøya and Hopen have settlements.
