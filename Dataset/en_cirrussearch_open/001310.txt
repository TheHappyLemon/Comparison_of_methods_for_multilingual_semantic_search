Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (also referred to as Scooby-Doo 2) is a 2004 American fantasy adventure comedy film based on the animated franchise Scooby-Doo. It is the second installment in the Scooby-Doo live-action film series and the sequel to 2002's Scooby-Doo, and was directed by Raja Gosnell, written by James Gunn, and released by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film stars Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini, Matthew Lillard, Seth Green, Tim Blake Nelson, Peter Boyle and Alicia Silverstone, with Neil Fanning reprising his role as the voice of Scooby-Doo. The film was released on March 26, 2004. Like the first film, it received mostly negative reviews from critics. While profitable, the film grossed less at the box office than its predecessor, resulting in a third film, set to be written and directed by Gunn, being cancelled. A telefilm reboot featuring a new cast, Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins, aired on Cartoon Network in 2009.
