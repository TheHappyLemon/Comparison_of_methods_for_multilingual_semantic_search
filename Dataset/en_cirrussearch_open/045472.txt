Postman Pat is a British stop motion animated children's television series first produced by Woodland Animations. The series follows the adventures of Pat Clifton, a postman who works for Royal Mail postal service in the fictional village of Greendale (inspired by the real valley of Longsleddale near Kendal). Postman Pat's first 13-episode series was screened on BBC One in 1981. John Cunliffe wrote the original treatment and scripts for the series, which was directed by animator Ivor Wood, who also worked on The Magic Roundabout, The Wombles, Paddington, and The Herbs. Following the success of the first series, four TV specials and a second series of 13 episodes were produced during the 1990s. In this series, Pat had a family shown on screen for the first time (though his wife had been mentioned in a number of episodes). A new version of the series was produced by Cosgrove Hall Films from 2003 to 2008 and expanded on many aspects of the original series. The show ended on 29 March 2017, after 8 series and 12 specials. The SDS spin-off is still being rerun on CBeebies on weekends, and the previous Cosgrove Hall series from the 2000s is being rerun on ITVBe's children's block littleBe, starting from September 2023. The original two Ivor Wood series are available to watch on BritBox, Prime Video and on DVD.
