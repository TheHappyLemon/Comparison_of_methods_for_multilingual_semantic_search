Geostorm is a 2017 American science-fiction disaster film directed, cowritten, and coproduced by Dean Devlin (in his feature directorial debut). The film stars Gerard Butler, Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish, Ed Harris, and Andy García. It follows a satellite designer who tries to save the world from a storm of epic proportions caused by malfunctioning climate-controlling satellites. Principal photography began on October 20, 2014, in New Orleans, Louisiana. After poor test screenings, reshoots took place in December 2016 under executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer, writer Laeta Kalogridis, and new director Danny Cannon. To date, the film is the only co-production between Skydance Media and Warner Bros. Pictures. Geostorm was released in the United States on October 20, 2017, in all formats, and heavily underperformed at the box office, grossing only $221.6 million worldwide against a $120–$130 million budget and losing Warner Bros. $71.6 million. The film was also lambasted by critics, who criticized its storytelling and visual effects.
