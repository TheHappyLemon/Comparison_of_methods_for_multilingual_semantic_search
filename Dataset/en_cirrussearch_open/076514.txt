"Ja, vi elsker dette landet" (Norwegian pronunciation: [ˈjɑː viː ˈɛ̂lskər ˈɖɛ̂tːə ˈlɑ̀nːdət] ; English: "Yes, we love this country") is the Norwegian national anthem. Originally a patriotic song, it came to be commonly regarded as the de facto national anthem of Norway in the early 20th century, after being used alongside "Sønner av Norge" since the 1860s. It was officially adopted in 2019. The lyrics were written by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson between 1859 and 1868, and the melody was written by his cousin Rikard Nordraak sometime during the winter of 1863 and 1864. It was first performed publicly on 17 May 1864 in connection with the 50th anniversary of the constitution. Usually only the first and the last two verses are sung, with the first being by far the most common.
