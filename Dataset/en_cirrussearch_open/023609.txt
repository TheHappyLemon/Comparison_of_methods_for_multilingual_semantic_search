Ve (В в; italics: В в) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the voiced labiodental fricative /v/, like ⟨v⟩ in "vase". It can also represent /ʋ/ The capital letter Ve looks the same as the capital Latin letter B but is pronounced differently. Ve is commonly romanized by the Latin letter V (as described by ISO 9), but sometimes the Latin letter W is used instead, such as in Polish,[citation needed] or by the German Duden transcription.
