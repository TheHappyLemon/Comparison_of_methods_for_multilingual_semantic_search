The Khanate of Kazan (Tatar: Казан ханлыгы, romanized: Kazan xanlıgı; Russian: Казанское ханство, romanized: Kazanskoye khanstvo) was a medieval Tatar Turkic state that occupied the territory of the former Volga Bulgaria between 1438 and 1552. The khanate covered contemporary Tatarstan, Mari El, Chuvashia, Mordovia, and parts of Udmurtia and Bashkortostan; its capital was the city of Kazan. It was one of the successor states of the Golden Horde (Kipchak Khanate), and it came to an end when it was conquered by the Tsardom of Russia.
