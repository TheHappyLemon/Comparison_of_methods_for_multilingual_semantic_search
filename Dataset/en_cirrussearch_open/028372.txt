Arvid Kubbel (12 September 1889 â€“ 11 January 1938) was a chess player and composer of chess problems and endgame studies from the Soviet Union. He was a brother of Evgeny and Leonid Kubbel (one of the best-known chess composers); their father was born in Latvia, of Baltic German descent. He played in relatively few tournaments, but was among the stronger players of the early Soviet Union.
