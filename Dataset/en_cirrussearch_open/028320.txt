Mezaine, officially Military training area Mežaine (Latvian: Militārais poligons Mežaine), is a Latvian National Armed Forces military training area of the 4th Brigade of the Latvian National Guard in Raņķi Parish, Kuldīga Municipality near the town of Skrunda. The military training area consists of a former ghost town, variously known as Skrunda-1, Skrunda-2, Lokators or Līdumnieki, and the surrounding area. The ghost town was built in the 1960s to house Soviet military personnel serving at two Soviet Dnepr radar (NATO designation "Hen House") installations at the site, after the collapse of the Soviet Union the radar stations were torn down and the buildings abandoned. It has been repurposed for use in urban warfare training.
