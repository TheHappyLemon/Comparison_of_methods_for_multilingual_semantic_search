The 2012 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXX Olympiad, was a summer multi-sport event held in London, the capital of the United Kingdom, from 27 July to 12 August. A total of 10,768 athletes from 204 nations participated in 302 events in 26 sports across 39 different disciplines. Overall, 86 nations received at least one medal, and 55 of them won at least one gold medal. Athletes from the United States won the most medals overall, with 104, and the most gold medals, with 48. The latter record is the largest gold medal haul for the US at a non-US hosted Olympics. Host nation Great Britain won 29 gold medals and 65 overall medals, making it the most successful Olympics performance for that nation since the 1908 edition. Michael Phelps and Missy Franklin won the most gold medals at the Games with four each. Phelps also won the highest number of medals overall, winning six in total. Bahrain, Botswana, Cyprus, Gabon, Grenada, Guatemala, and Montenegro all won their first Olympic medals, with Bahrain and Grenada winning their nation's first Olympic gold medal. Previously, Montenegrin athletes had competed as nationals of Serbia and Montenegro and of Yugoslavia. Taekwondo athlete Milica Mandić from Serbia won the first Olympic gold medal for that nation as an independent nation. During and after the Games, many athletes who were caught doping, or tested positive for banned substances, were disqualified from competition and had their medals revoked. To date, 40 medals have been stripped, with Russia accounting for 17 of those.
