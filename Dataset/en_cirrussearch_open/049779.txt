João Félix Sequeira (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʒuˈɐ̃w ˈfɛliks]; born 10 November 1999) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for La Liga club Barcelona, on loan from Atlético Madrid, and for the Portugal national team. He can also play as a winger or an attacking midfielder. Félix initially trained at Porto's youth academy, before moving to rivals Benfica in 2015. He began playing for the latter's reserve team a year later and was promoted to the first team in 2018, making his debut at age 17. He helped Benfica win the league title in his first and only season with them, and was awarded Primeira Liga's Best Young Player of the Year and the Golden Boy award. In 2019, at age 19, Félix signed with Atlético Madrid for a club-record transfer worth €126 million (£113 million), the fourth-most expensive football transfer. In his second season at the club, he helped the team win the 2020–21 La Liga, which ended the club's seven-year league title drought. Félix is a former Portugal youth international, representing his country at under-18, under-19, and under-21 levels. He earned his first cap for the senior national team during the semi-finals of the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals, winning the inaugural edition of the competition with his nation on home soil.
