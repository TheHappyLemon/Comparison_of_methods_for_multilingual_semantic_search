A memory card is an electronic data storage device used for storing digital information, typically using flash memory. These are commonly used in digital portable electronic devices, such as Digital cameras as well as in many early games consoles such as the Nintendo Wii. They allow adding memory to such devices using a card in a socket instead of protruding USB flash drives. Common types of flash memory card include SD cards (including microSD), Sony's Memory Stick and CompactFlash. However, SD cards are by far the most common type of memory cards nowadays[citation needed].
