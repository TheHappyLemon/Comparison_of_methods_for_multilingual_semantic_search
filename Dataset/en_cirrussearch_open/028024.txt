The common gull or sea mew (Larus canus) is a medium-sized gull that breeds in the Palearctic. The closely related short-billed gull is sometimes included in this species, which may be known collectively as "mew gull". Many common gulls migrate further south in winter. There are differing accounts as to how the species acquired its vernacular name (see Etymology section below). The name "sea mew" is a calque of the Dutch name zeemeeuw.[citation needed]
