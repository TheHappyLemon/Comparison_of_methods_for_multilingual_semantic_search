The province of Syracuse (Italian: provincia di Siracusa; Sicilian: pruvincia di Sarausa) was a province in the autonomous island region of Sicily, Italy. Its capital was the city of Syracuse, a town established by Greek colonists arriving from Corinth in the 8th century BC. It had an area of 2,109 square kilometres (814 sq mi) and a total population of 403,985 (2016). Syracuse had 8% of the Sicilian population and 8.2% of Sicily's area. Following the suppression of the Sicilian provinces, it was replaced in August 2015 by the free municipal consortium of Syracuse (Italian: libero consorzio comunale di Siracusa).
