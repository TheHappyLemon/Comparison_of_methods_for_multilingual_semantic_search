In organic chemistry, ethers are a class of compounds that contain an ether group—an oxygen atom connected to two organyl groups (e.g., alkyl or aryl). They have the general formula R−O−R′, where R and R′ represent organyl groups (e.g., alkyl or aryl). Ethers can again be classified into two varieties: if the organyl groups are the same on both sides of the oxygen atom, then it is a simple or symmetrical ether, whereas if they are different, the ethers are called mixed or unsymmetrical ethers. A typical example of the first group is the solvent and anaesthetic diethyl ether, commonly referred to simply as "ether" (CH3−CH2−O−CH2−CH3). Ethers are common in organic chemistry and even more prevalent in biochemistry, as they are common linkages in carbohydrates and lignin.
