The Case of the Golden Idol is a 2022 adventure and puzzle video game developed by Color Gray Games and published by Playstack for macOS and Windows. The game depicts a narrative spanning 40 years in the 18th century, in which players collect clues to piece together concepts, characters, and evidence to provide context to the story. The game was developed by Latvian independent developers Ernests and Andrejs Kļaviņš, who aimed to create a detective game influenced by the visual presentation of 1990s adventure games. The Case of the Golden Idol was similarly inspired by the design of the 2018 game Return of the Obra Dinn by Lucas Pope, with the game receiving similar comparisons from reviewers. Upon release, the game received praise for its use of deduction to present its narrative, and distinctive visual presentation, and received accolades as one of the best games of 2022 for its narrative and design. Following release, two expansions to the game, The Spider of Lanka and The Lemurian Vampire, were released as downloadable content in May and August 2023.
