Ireland has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 56 times since making its debut at the 1965 contest in Naples, missing only two contests since, in 1983 and 2002. The contest's final is broadcast in Ireland on RTÉ One. Ireland shares a joint record total of seven wins with Sweden, and is the only country to have won three times consecutively. Ireland has finished second four times, while Sweden has done that just once. However, all of Ireland's victories were decided by juries only, in the era before public voting became the norm in 1998. Ireland's seven wins were achieved by the following artists: Dana with "All Kinds of Everything" (1970), Johnny Logan with "What's Another Year?" (1980) and "Hold Me Now" (1987), Linda Martin with "Why Me?" (1992), Niamh Kavanagh with "In Your Eyes" (1993), Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan with "Rock 'n' Roll Kids" (1994) and Eimear Quinn with "The Voice" (1996). Johnny Logan also wrote the 1992 winning entry. Ireland, who also finished second with Sean Dunphy (1967), Linda Martin (1984), Liam Reilly (1990) and Marc Roberts (1997), has a total of 18 top five results. Since the introduction of the qualifying round in 1994, Ireland has won the contest twice. Since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, Ireland has failed to reach the final 11 times, and has twice finished last in the final, in 2007 and 2013. Ireland's only top 10 result in the last 16 contests (2007–23) is Jedward's eighth-place in 2011.
