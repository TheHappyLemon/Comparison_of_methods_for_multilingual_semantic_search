In linguistics, grammatical person is the grammatical distinction between deictic references to participant(s) in an event; typically, the distinction is between the speaker (first person), the addressee (second person), and others (third person). A language's set of pronouns is typically defined by grammatical person. First person includes the speaker (English: I, we), second person is the person or people spoken to (English: thou or you), and third person includes all that are not listed above (English: he, she, it, they). It also frequently affects verbs and sometimes nouns or possessive relationships.
