The Portugal men's national basketball team (Portuguese: Seleção Portuguesa de Basquetebol) represents Portugal in international basketball competition. The team is controlled by the Portuguese Basketball Federation. Portugal doesn't have much history on the international stage, although they have qualified for the EuroBasket three times (1951, 2007, 2011). While Portugal has made multiple appearances at the continental level, they continue their quest to qualify for the global stage at the FIBA World Cup.
