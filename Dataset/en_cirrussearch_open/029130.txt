The original Constitution of East Germany (the German Democratic Republic; German: Verfassung der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik) was promulgated on 7 October 1949. It was heavily based on the Weimar Constitution (Weimarer Reichsverfassung) and nominally established the GDR as a liberal democratic republic. In 1968, the East German government adopted a new, fully Communist constitution that was based on Marxismâ€“Leninism, political unitarism, and collective leadership. There were further amendments to the 1968 constitution in 1974. With the political events of 1989, there were attempts to draft a new constitution for East Germany, but these efforts never materialized due to the dissolution of East Germany and the accession of its states into the neighboring Federal Republic.
