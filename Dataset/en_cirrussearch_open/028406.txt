Hawaii Five-0 is an American action police procedural television series that centers around a special police major crimes task force operating at the behest of the governor of Hawaii. It is a reboot of the 1968â€“1980 series Hawaii Five-O (the original series had the letter "O" instead of the number "0" in its title), which also aired on CBS. The series was produced by K/O Paper Products and 101st Street Television, initially in association with CBS Television Studios. The show received praise for its modern take on the original series. The series premiered on September 20, 2010, on CBS and aired on Mondays for its first three seasons. Beginning with season four, the program was moved to Fridays. Hawaii Five-0 ran for seven additional seasons and concluded with its 240th and final episode on April 3, 2020. Peter M. Lenkov, one of the show's developers, created two additional police shows that were reboots of previous TV series: MacGyver and Magnum P.I. All three take place in the same fictional universe, and Hawaii Five-0 had crossover episodes with both of the others. The three shows have been collectively referred to as the "Lenkov-verse". The series also exists in the same fictional universe as the NCIS franchise by way of a crossover event with NCIS: Los Angeles.
