Patrick Maroon (born April 23, 1988) is an American professional ice hockey left winger for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). Nicknamed the "Big Rig", Maroon has previously played for the Anaheim Ducks, Edmonton Oilers, New Jersey Devils, St. Louis Blues, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Minnesota Wild. Maroon is a three-time Stanley Cup champion, winning in three consecutive seasons (with the Blues in 2019, and the Lightning in 2020 and 2021). Growing up in St. Louis, Maroon attended Oakville High School where he was recruited to play in the North American Hockey League (NAHL) by Kelly Chase and Al MacInnis. Following two standout seasons with the Texarkana Bandits, he was drafted 161st overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. He spent three years within their organization before being traded to the Anaheim Ducks and subsequently making his NHL debut in the 2011â€“12 season. Maroon played three seasons at the NHL level with the Ducks where he made an impact during their 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs run. Due to inconsistency, he was traded to the Edmonton Oilers and New Jersey Devils before landing in St. Louis Blues in 2018. In his only season with the Blues, he helped them win the Stanley Cup for the first time in franchise history. He would win the Stanley Cup twice more in the next two years with the Lightning, becoming one of twelve players in NHL history to win back-to-back Stanley Cups on different teams, and the first since Cory Stillman in 2006. In 2021, Maroon became the first player to win three consecutive Stanley Cups since several members of the New York Islanders did so from 1980 to 1983.
