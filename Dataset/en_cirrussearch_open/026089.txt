The Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2015 was the thirteenth edition of the annual Junior Eurovision Song Contest, and took place, for the first time, in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian national broadcaster BNT was the host broadcaster for the event. The final took place on 21 November 2015 and was held at the Arena Armeec in Sofia. Poli Genova, a Bulgarian singer and former representative of Bulgaria in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 (and later the Eurovision Song Contest 2016), hosted the show. A total of seventeen countries participated, with Australia and Ireland making their debuts. Albania and Macedonia returned after being absent since the 2012 and 2013 contests, respectively. Croatia and Cyprus withdrew after returning in the 2014 edition, while Sweden withdrew for the first time since 2008. The winner of the contest was Destiny Chukunyere, who represented Malta with the song "Not My Soul". Armenia and Slovenia finished in second and third place, respectively. This was Malta's second victory in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, having won previously in 2013. This contest marked the second time a country won twice in a three-year period (following Belarus winning twice in a period of three years between 2005 and 2007). Malta's 185 points were also the highest number of points ever received at the time, beating Spain's record of 171 points set during the 2004 edition.
