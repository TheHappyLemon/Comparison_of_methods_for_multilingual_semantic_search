Stanislav Ivanovich Rogolev (Russian: Станислав Иванович Роголев, 14 February 1941 – 19 June 1984) was a Soviet serial killer. For one and a half years he attacked 21 women, killing ten of them. In 1980, Rogolev was convicted four times, and charged once with rape. According to writer Alexander Chekhlov, Rogolev was the informer of Aloizs Vaznis, a police officer, who, in turn, tried to shield Rogolev. In particular, he gave Rogolev full information about the crimes, fabricating a confession in which he could be declared insane. It was also believed that Rogolev had information about the progress of the investigation. According to a writer and lawyer Andris Grūtups, Rogolev was a secret agent of the deputy minister, General Anrijs Kavalieris. The shock is still too soft a word to describe the state in which Latvia was in the early 80's. Schoolgirls went to classes in close-knit groups, husbands greeted wives from late trains, and all over the place were reinforced police detachments. In every doorway, law-abiding citizens, frightened by a man, seemed to see the worst and most bloody maniac of Latvia of the Soviet period - Stanislav Rogolev.
