Monastyryska Raion (Ukrainian: Монастириський район) was a raion (district) in Ternopil Oblast in western Ukraine. Its administrative center was the city of Monastyryska. The raion was abolished on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ternopil Oblast to three. The area of Monastyryska Raion was merged into Chortkiv Raion. The last estimate of the raion population was 25,889 (2020 est.). The raion was created in 1939 during the World War II when Poland was partitioned between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union. Monastyryska Raion was created out of former Buchach County. Couple of years later it was abolished following the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany. The raion was reinstated in 1944 after return of the Soviet regime.
