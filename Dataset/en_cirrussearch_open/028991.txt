The PostFinance Top Scorer is awarded annually to the Swiss National League (NL) and Swiss League (SL) player who leads the league in points at the end of the regular season. The reigning Top Scorer from each team wears a yellow flame-emblazoned shirt and helmet in all playoff games. Once the qualifiers have taken place, the player with the most points in the league is then crowned the PostFinance Top Scorer of the NL or SL.
