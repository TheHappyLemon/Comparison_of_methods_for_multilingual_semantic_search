Riot! is the second studio album by the American rock band Paramore. It was released in the United States on June 12, 2007 through Fueled by Ramen as a follow-up to their debut album, All We Know Is Falling (2005). The album was produced by David Bendeth and written by band members Hayley Williams and Josh Farro, with Bendeth, and fellow band member Zac Farro co-writing on select tracks. The album explores a "diverse range of styles," while not straying far from the "signature sound" of their debut album, with several critics comparing it to the music of Kelly Clarkson and Avril Lavigne. The cover of the album also resembles the cover artwork of No Doubt's 2001 album Rock Steady. Riot! received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its sound, and noted its "crossover potential". The album was successful in the United States, reaching number fifteen on the Billboard 200 and achieving triple-platinum status on April 20, 2021, by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was also certified platinum in both the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and the Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and gold in both New Zealand and Canada. Its lead single, "Misery Business", reached top-thirty and forty positions in the US and is considered the band's "breakthrough" hit, credited with introducing the band to a mainstream audience. Its third and fourth singles, "Crushcrushcrush", and "That's What You Get", were also successful with both achieving a platinum certification by the RIAA.
