Gyula Grosics (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈɟulɒ ˈɡroʃit͡ʃ]; 4 February 1926 – 13 June 2014) was a Hungarian football goalkeeper who played 86 times for the Hungary national football team and was part of the "Golden Team" of the 1950s. Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, he was thought to be the first goalkeeper to play as the sweeper-keeper. Grosics was nicknamed "Black Panther" (Hungarian: Fekete Párduc), because he wore black clothing while playing. He won a gold medal in football at the 1952 Summer Olympics.
