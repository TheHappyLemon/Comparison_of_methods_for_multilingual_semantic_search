The ATP Masters events, known as ATP Masters 1000 tournaments since 2009, are an annual series of nine tennis tournaments featuring the top-ranked players on the ATP Tour since its inception in 1990. The Masters tournaments, sitting below the Grand Slam tournaments and the year-end championships, make up the most coveted trophies on the annual ATP Tour calendar. In addition to the quadrennial Summer Olympics, they are collectively known as the 'Big Titles'. Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most Masters singles titles with 40. By completing the career set of all nine Masters singles titles in 2018, Djokovic became the first and only player to achieve the career Golden Masters. In 2020, Djokovic completed a second career Golden Masters. In doubles, the Bryan brothers (Bob and Mike) won a record 39 doubles titles as a team. Daniel Nestor and the Bryan brothers are the only doubles players to achieve the career Golden Masters.
