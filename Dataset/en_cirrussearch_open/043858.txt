Rogers Arena is a multi-purpose arena located at 800 Griffiths Way in the downtown area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Opened in 1995, the arena was known as General Motors Place (GM Place) from its opening until July 6, 2010, when General Motors Canada ended its naming rights sponsorship and a new agreement for those rights was reached with Rogers Communications. Rogers Arena was built to replace Pacific Coliseum as Vancouver's primary indoor sports facility and in part due to the National Basketball Association (NBA) 1995 expansion into Canada, when Vancouver and Toronto were given expansion teams. It is home to the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League, the Vancouver Warriors of the National Lacrosse League and the Vancouver Titans of the Overwatch League. The arena also hosted the ice hockey events at the 2010 Winter Olympics. The name of the arena temporarily became Canada Hockey Place during the Olympics. It was previously home to the Vancouver Grizzlies of the NBA from 1995 to 2001. The Grizzlies spent six seasons in Vancouver before relocating to Memphis, for the 2001â€“02 season. Prior to the start of the 2022/23 NHL season the arena underwent one of three phases. Phase one consisted of a complete renovation of the players dressing room and team staff area. Phase two being completed prior to the start of the 2023/24 NHL season will consist of a new center hung video board and a new ribbon board going around the arena above the lower bowl. A new VIP restaurant is being added in between the two tunnels that lead out to the home and away team benches. Prior to the start of the 2024/25 season the third and final phase of the arena upgrades will be completed which will replace all the seats in the upper and lower bowl of the arena.
