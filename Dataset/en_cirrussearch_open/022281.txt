Born in Hallein, Veith is from the village of Adnet in Salzburg and made her World Cup debut at age 17 in November 2006. She competed in all five alpine disciplines, but omitted slalom as of January 2012. Her major breakthrough came when she successfully became world champion in the super combined alpine event in 2011, without having won a World Cup race before.
