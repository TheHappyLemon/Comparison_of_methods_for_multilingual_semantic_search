Karolīne Lizete Kronvalde, née Roloff (2 April 1836 – 23 October 1913) was a Latvian teacher and feminist. Her letter to the Baltic Herald (Latvian: Baltijas Vēstnesis) in 1870, defending women's rights to an education and freedom from paternalistic restrictions has been "regarded as the spark igniting women’s activism and movements in Latvia thereafter."
