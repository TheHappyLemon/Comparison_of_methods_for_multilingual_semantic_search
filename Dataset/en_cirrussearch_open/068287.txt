The English Football League Two, simply known as League Two in England and for sponsorship purposes as Sky Bet League Two, is the third and lowest division of the English Football League (EFL) and fourth-highest tier overall in the English football league system. Introduced for the 2004–05 English football season as Football League Two, it is a rebrand of the former Football League Third Division, which itself is a rebrand of the now-defunct Football League Fourth Division prior to the 1992 launch of the Premier League. As of the 2022–23 season, Mansfield Town and Newport County hold the longest tenure in this division following their respective promotions in the 2012–13 season. There are currently two former Premier League clubs competing in this division: Bradford City (1999–2001) and Swindon Town (1993–94).
