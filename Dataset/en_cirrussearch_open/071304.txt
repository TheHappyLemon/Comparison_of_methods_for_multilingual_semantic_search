Wilhelm Litten (born August 5, 1880, in St. Petersburg, † January 28, 1932, in Baghdad) was a German diplomat, orientalist, writer and translator. During his time as a dragoman at the German Embassy in Tehran, he collected materials from which he developed regional, cultural and economic history studies. During World War I, in early 1916, he witnessed the death marches of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. His report The Path of Horror is a source on the Armenian genocide. After the war, Litten continued to work in the diplomatic service. From 1920 to 1924 he was consul in Libau and from 1928 in Baghdad, as well as chargé d'affaires of the German Reich there after establishing diplomatic relations with Iraq.
