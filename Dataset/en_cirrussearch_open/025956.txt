Šeškinė (literally Lithuanian: 'A place with polecats') is a fairly new district located in the north of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, built in 1977 as a microdistrict. It is located to the east of Justiniškės district, to the south and south-east of Žvėrynas and Šnipiškės elderships, to the north of Fabijoniškės and Pašilaičiai districts, and to the west of Verkiai district. Šeškinė is a largely residential district although it is also home to the Akropolis Mall. The second largest sports facilities in Lithuania, the Siemens Arena and the Lietuvos Rytas Arena, are also located there. The only water park in Vilnius was opened on June 1, 2007, next to the Siemens Arena. Šeškinė is one of the most densely populated districts, having a density of 3,600/km². It's also one of the smallest, being the 6th smallest eldership in Vilnius.
