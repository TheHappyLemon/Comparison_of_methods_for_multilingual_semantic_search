Taguig (Tagalog: [taˈɡiɡ] ), officially the City of Taguig (Filipino: Lungsod ng Taguig), is the fourth-most populous city in the Philippines with a population of 1.2 million people. The city is located alongside the northwestern shores of Laguna de Bay in Metro Manila, Philippines. Taguig is known for Bonifacio Global City, one of the leading financial centers of the Philippines. Originally a fishing village during the Spanish and American colonial periods, it experienced rapid growth when former military reservations were converted by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) into financial centers and mixed-use planned communities. Taguig became a highly urbanized city with the passage of Republic Act No. 8487 in 2004, which was ratified by a plebiscite. The city covers about 54.04 square kilometers (20.86 sq mi). It is located in the southeastern portion of Metro Manila and bordered by Pasig and Pateros to the north, Makati and Mandaluyong to the northwest, Pasay and Parañaque to the west, Taytay, Rizal to the northeast and Muntinlupa to the south.
