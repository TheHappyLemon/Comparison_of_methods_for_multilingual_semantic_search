The 1980 NHL Entry Draft was the 18th NHL Entry Draft. It was held at the Montreal Forum. This was the first time that an NHL arena hosted the draft. The National Hockey League (NHL) teams selected 210 players eligible for entry into professional ranks, in the reverse order of the 1979–80 NHL season and playoff standings. This is the list of those players selected. The minimum draft age was lowered from 19 to 18, but prospective draftees had to be of age by September 15 rather than any date in the relevant birth year. It was the first time the Forum hosted the draft. The hometown Montreal Canadiens used the first selection on Doug Wickenheiser. The last active players in the NHL from this draft class were Paul Coffey and Larry Murphy, who both retired after the 2000–01 season.
