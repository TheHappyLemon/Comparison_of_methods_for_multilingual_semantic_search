S.M.A.R.T. (or SMART) is an acronym used as a mnemonic device to establish criteria for effective goal-setting and objective development. This framework is commonly applied in various fields, including project management, employee performance management, and personal development. The term was first proposed by George T. Doran in the November 1981 issue of 'Management Review', where he advocated for setting objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time-boundâ€”hence the acronym S.M.A.R.T. Since its inception, the SMART framework has evolved, leading to the emergence of different variations of the acronym. One commonly used version incorporates alternative words, including 'attainable,' 'relevant,' and 'timely.' Additionally, several authors have introduced supplementary letters to the acronym. For instance, some refer to SMARTS goals, which include the element of 'self-defined,' while others utilize SMARTER goals. Proponents of SMART objectives argue that these criteria facilitate a clear framework for goal setting and evaluation, applicable across various contexts such as business (between employee and employer) and sports (between athlete and coach). This framework enables the individual setting the goal to have a precise understanding of the expected outcomes, while the evaluator has concrete criteria for assessment. The SMART acronym is linked to Peter Drucker's Management by Objectives (MBO) concept, illustrating its foundational role in strategic planning and performance management.
