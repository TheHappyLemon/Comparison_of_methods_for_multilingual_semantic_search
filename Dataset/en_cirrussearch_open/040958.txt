Quattro (meaning four in Italian and stylized in lower case) is the trademark used by the automotive brand Audi to indicate that all-wheel drive (AWD) technologies or systems are used on specific models of its automobiles. The word "quattro" is a registered trademark of Audi AG, a subsidiary of the German automotive enterprise, Volkswagen Group. Quattro was first introduced in 1980 on the permanent four-wheel drive Audi Quattro model, often referred to as the Ur-Quattro (meaning "original" or "first"). The term quattro has since been applied to all subsequent Audi AWD models. Due to the nomenclature rights derived from the trademark, the word quattro is now always spelled with a lower case "q" by the manufacturer, in honour of its former namesake.[citation needed] Other companies in the Volkswagen Group have used different trademarks for their 4WD vehicles. While Audi has always used the term "quattro", Volkswagen-branded cars initially used "syncro", but more recently,[when?] VW uses "4motion". Å koda simply uses the nomenclature "4x4" after the model name, whereas SEAT uses merely "4" ("4Drive" more recently[when?]). None of the above trademarks or nomenclatures defines the operation or type of 4WD system, as detailed below.
