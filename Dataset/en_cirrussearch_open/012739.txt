Jacob William Davis (born Jākobs Jufess; Russian: Якоб Яковлевич Юфес, May 14, 1831 – January 20, 1908) was a Russian-American tailor of Latvian Jewish origin who is credited with inventing modern jeans. Growing up in Russian Empire, he emigrated to the United States as a young man and spent some time in Canada as well. He invented jeans by using sturdy cloth and rivets to strengthen weak points in the seams, and partnered with Levi Strauss to mass-produce them.
