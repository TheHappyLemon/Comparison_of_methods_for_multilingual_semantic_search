The 2012 United States Grand Prix (formally the 2012 Formula 1 United States Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit of the Americas in Travis County, near Austin, Texas on November 18, 2012. The race, run over fifty-six laps, was the penultimate round of the 2012 championship. It was the inaugural race at the circuit, and the first time the United States Grand Prix had been held since 2007. On Sunday a capacity crowd of 117,429 watched the race around the brand new 20-turn circuit. Sebastian Vettel started the race from pole position. Lewis Hamilton won the race, his last for McLaren before his move to Mercedes, with Vettel finishing second and Fernando Alonso in third. Vettel's second place gave Red Bull Racing enough points to secure their third consecutive World Constructors' Championship.
