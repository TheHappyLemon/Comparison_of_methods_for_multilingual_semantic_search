The Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian People's Self-Defence (Ukrainian: Українська Національна Асамблея-Українська Народна Самооборона, УНА-УНСО, UNA-UNSO) was a Ukrainian nationalist organisation. It was composed by a political wing (the Ukrainian National Assembly — UNA) and a paramilitary wing (Ukrainian People's Self-Defence — UNSO). According to Andreas Umland and Anton Shekhovtsov, the UNA-UNSO was created in 1991 as a "formation manned by UNA members who had served in the Soviet armed forces ... to confront the State Committee on the State of Emergency". The UNA-UNSO has been described by International-security expert Andrew McGregor as a "influential but fringe movement", which deeply influenced far-right politics in Ukraine due its visibility and militancy, although it still had small numbers. Although the Ukrainian National Assembly (Ukrainian: УНА, UNA) was the organisation's political wing, on 22 May 2014 it merged with Right Sector; the UNSO continues to operate independently. The UNSO has participated in multiple international conflicts by sending volunteers to support various belligerents. Including the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, Transnistria War, the War in Abkhazia, First Chechen War, the Yugoslav Wars and the Russo-Ukrainian War.
