A cappuccino (/ˌkæpʊˈtʃiːnoʊ/ ; Italian: [kapputˈtʃiːno]; pl.: cappuccini; from German Kapuziner) is an espresso-based coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with steamed milk including a layer of milk foam. Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring with cinnamon (in the United States) or cocoa powder (in Europe and Australasia). It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte, and topped with a thick layer of foam rather than being made with microfoam. The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the color of their habits, and in this context referring to the color of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee (today mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink. According to a popular but unverified legend, cappuccino was named after the Italian Capuchin friar Marco d'Aviano who contributed to the victory of the Battle of Vienna. The Viennese bestowed the name Kapuziner, possibly in the 18th century, on an early version that included whipped cream and spices of unknown origin. The Italian cappuccino was unknown outside Italy until the 1930s. It is sometimes said to have been born in the coffeehouses of Trieste and other Italian areas of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the early 20th century, spreading throughout Italy after World War I and later worldwide. However, the existence in central Italy of a coffee drink mixed with milk with the name cappuccino is already documented in the 19th century.
