Anthony DeAngelo (born October 24, 1995) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman for the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously played with the Arizona Coyotes, New York Rangers, and the Philadelphia Flyers. DeAngelo was born in Sewell, New Jersey, and played minor ice hockey there until the age of 14, when he joined the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders to become the youngest ever player for the United States Hockey League. Although DeAngelo's season with the RoughRiders ended early due to a knee injury, he was taken by the Sarnia Sting of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in the second round of the 2011 OHL Priority Selection Draft. He had a strong offensive output for the Sting, scoring 58 points in his sophomore season. He was traded to the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in 2015, with whom he won both the Max Kaminsky Trophy for OHL defensemen, and the CHL Defenceman of the Year award. The Tampa Bay Lightning selected DeAngelo 19th overall in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, and he signed a three-year, entry-level contract with them later that year. After one season with their American Hockey League affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch, DeAngelo was traded to the Coyotes, and he made his NHL debut in 2016. He was again traded, this time to the Rangers, in 2017, and steadily improved his performance until the 2019â€“20 NHL season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
