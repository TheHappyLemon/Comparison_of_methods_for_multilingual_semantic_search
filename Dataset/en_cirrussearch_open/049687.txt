Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days is a 2012 American comedy film directed by David Bowers from a screenplay by Wallace Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes. It stars Zachary Gordon and Steve Zahn. Robert Capron, Devon Bostick, Rachael Harris, Peyton List, Grayson Russell, and Karan Brar also have prominent roles. It is the third installment in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series. It was released by 20th Century Fox on August 3, grossing $77 million in the box office, and like its predecessors, it received mixed reviews. The film is based on the third and fourth books of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book series, The Last Straw and Dog Days, respectively. The "Holly Hills" and "Spag Union" portions of it are featured in the third book, while much of the rest is based on the fourth book. The film is also the last in the series to feature the original cast members, as many of the cast (such as Zachary Gordon, Robert Capron, and Devon Bostick) outgrew their roles and new actors were cast for the next installment, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul, which was released on May 19, 2017.
