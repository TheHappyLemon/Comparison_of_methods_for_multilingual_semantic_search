Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 American action thriller film directed by John McTiernan (who directed the first installment). It was written by Jonathan Hensleigh, based on the screenplay Simon Says by Hensleigh and on the characters created by Roderick Thorp for his 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever. Die Hard with a Vengeance is the third film in the Die Hard film series, after Die Hard 2 (1990). It is followed by Live Free or Die Hard (2007) and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013). The film stars Bruce Willis as NYPD Lieutenant John McClane and Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's reluctant partner Zeus Carver, who team up to stop an East German terrorist group headed by "Simon" (Jeremy Irons) who have planted bombs across New York City and plot to steal the gold bullion of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It was released on May 19, 1995 to mixed reviews and became the highest-grossing film of the year. The film later gained a cult following and is widely considered to be the best sequel in the franchise, as well as one of the best action films of the 1990s.
