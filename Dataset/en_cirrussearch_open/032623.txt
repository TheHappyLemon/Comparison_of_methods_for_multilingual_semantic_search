The Bank of Estonia (Estonian: Eesti Pank) is the Estonian member of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for Estonia from 1919 to 2010, albeit with a long suspension between 1940 and 1991, issuing the Estonian kroon. The bank doesn't translate its name to English but uses its Estonian name Eesti Pank in all English communications.
