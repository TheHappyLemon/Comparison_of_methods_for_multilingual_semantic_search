Kateryna Vasylivna Bilokur (Ukrainian: Катерина Василівна Білокур; December 7 [O.S. November 24] 1900 – 9 June 1961) was a Ukrainian folk artist born in the Poltava Governorate. Her birth date is unknown but 7 December is used as her official birthday. After an unpromising start, her works became known in the late 1930s and 1940s for their interest in nature. She was named People's Artist of Ukraine.[citation needed] It was said[by whom?] that Pablo Picasso saw her work exhibited in Paris and commented, "If we had an artist of this level, we would make the whole world talk about her."
