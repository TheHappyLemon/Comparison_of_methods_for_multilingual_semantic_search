Daniel Andre Sturridge (born 1 September 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker. He is currently a free agent. Since 2023, he has worked as a television pundit for Sky Sports. Sturridge was scouted by Aston Villa and played for a number of years in their younger academy sides before moving to Coventry City in 2002. He then signed for Manchester City in 2003. He continued his development at City and played in two FA Youth Cup finals. He made his first-team debut in the 2007–08 season, becoming the only player to score in the FA Youth Cup, FA Cup and Premier League in the same season. He left City in 2009 to sign for Chelsea, where he was loaned to Bolton Wanderers for the second half of the 2010–11 season. After a successful spell at Bolton, scoring eight goals in 12 appearances, he returned to Chelsea for the 2011–12 season, winning the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. He left Chelsea to join Liverpool in January 2013, where he formed an attacking partnership with Luis Suárez. Liverpool scored more than 100 goals in the 2013–14 Premier League season with Sturridge scoring 21 goals, behind only Suárez on 31. The following two seasons were curtailed by injuries, limiting Sturridge to very few appearances. He scored the opening goal in the 2016 UEFA Europa League final, although Liverpool eventually lost the game to Sevilla. He featured most often as a substitute in the next seasons under manager Jürgen Klopp, but was part of the UEFA Champions League-winning squad in 2019. He subsequently had spells with Turkish Süper Lig club Trabzonspor and Australian A-League club Perth Glory. Sturridge has represented England at all levels. He made his debut for the senior team against Sweden in November 2011 and was selected for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016, earning 28 England caps in total. He also represented Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
