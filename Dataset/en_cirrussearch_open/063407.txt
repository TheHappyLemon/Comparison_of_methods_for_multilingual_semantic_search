The Russian occupation of Mykolaiv Oblast is an ongoing military occupation of Ukraine's Mykolaiv Oblast by Russian forces during the Russian invasion of Ukraine as part of the southern Ukraine campaign. The Russian-installed occupation regime was called the "Nikolaev military-civilian administration". Russian forces never managed to capture the capital city of the oblast, Mykolaiv, although they attacked the city in February–March 2022. They managed to occupy territory in the southeast of the oblast, reaching as far as Voznesensk in March 2022 before withdrawing to the extreme southeast, bordering Kherson Oblast. On 21 September 2022, it was reported that Russian-occupied areas of Mykolaiv Oblast would be incorporated into the Russian administration for the Kherson Oblast. Russia declared that it had annexed the Kherson Oblast nine days later. On 10–11 November 2022, Ukrainian forces liberated Snihurivka and the surrounding area as part of the Ukrainian southern counteroffensive, in which a large swathe of territory in the west of Kherson Oblast—including the city of Kherson—was also liberated. By 12 November 2022, Russian forces had been expelled from the entire oblast apart from the outer portion of the Kinburn Peninsula in the far south.
