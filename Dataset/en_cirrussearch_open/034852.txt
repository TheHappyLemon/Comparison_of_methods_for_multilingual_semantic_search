"Net als toen" (Dutch pronunciation: [ˌnɛt ɑls ˈtun]; "Just like then") is a love song written in Dutch by Willy van Hemert, composed by Guus Jansen and performed by Corry Brokken in 1957 as the Netherlands' entry and runaway winner of the pan-European Eurovision Song Contest, which gained other versions and popularity in several countries. Described as a nostalgic chanson, with reminiscing lyrics and a violin-led melody, the song is about a wife who asks her husband if he remembers their early days as a couple, wishing for their romance to come back in the chorus while describing how it has gone out of the marriage in the verses. The song had received over a third of the total-vote percentage at both the Netherlands' 1957 National Songfestival and the following edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest, and reviews highlight its relatively high Eurovision score alongside complementing the performance's violin accompaniment while pointing out duration issues. Brokken recorded the song in three languages alongside covers by other Eurovision entrants, and the 1957 Dutch single released by Ronnex Records gained music chart achievements in the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as featured in approximately twenty music compilations inclusive of several other commercially successful albums.
