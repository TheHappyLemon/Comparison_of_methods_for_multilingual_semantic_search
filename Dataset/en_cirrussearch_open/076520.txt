Kong Christian stod ved højen mast (Danish pronunciation: [kʰʌŋ ˈkʰʁestjæn ˈstoðˀ ve̝ ˈhʌjˀn̩ mæst]; "King Christian stood by the lofty mast"), commonly shortened to Kong Christian, is the unofficial royal anthem of the Kingdom of Denmark that officially has equal status of national anthem together with Der er et yndigt land ("There is a Lovely Country"), though it is almost exclusively used in relation to the Danish royal house and the military. The theme of the song is the heroics of Danish and Norwegian sailors during the wars against Sweden (including the Torstenson War) in the 17th and 18th centuries. On New Year's Eve, it is tradition to sing along as the Danmarks Radio Girl's Choir sing the song on television, immediately after midnight following the other national anthem. Usually, only the first verse is sung on official occasions. Adopted in 1780, it is one of the oldest national anthems in the world.
