Benue River (French: la Bénoué), previously known as the Chadda River or Tchadda, is the major tributary of the Niger River. Almost its entire length of approximately 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) is navigable during the summer months. The size of its catchment basin is 319,000 km2 (123,000 sq mi). As a result, it is an important transportation route in the regions through which it flows. The name Benue comes from Binuwe meaning 'Mother of Waters’ in the Batta language.
