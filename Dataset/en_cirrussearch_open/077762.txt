The Swedish Gate (Latvian: Zviedru vārti) is situated in Riga, Latvia, and was erected 1698 as a part of the Riga Wall to provide access to barracks outside the city wall. These gates are the only remaining gates from the former eight. They are located on Torņa street 11 (Torņa iela 11). Kurt Wallander visits the site in the novel Dogs of Riga.
