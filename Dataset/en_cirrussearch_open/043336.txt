Zabivaka (Russian: Забива́ка) was the official mascot of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Russia. The name is a blend of the Russian words собака ("dog") and забивать ("to strike"). Designed by student designer Ekaterina Bocharova, aged 22, the mascot was selected by internet voting in Russia, beating out a tiger and a cat. In pre-World Cup events, the mascot was played by English YouTuber and actor Rafe Young.
