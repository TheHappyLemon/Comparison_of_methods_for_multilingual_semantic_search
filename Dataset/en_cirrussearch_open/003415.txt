This population inhabits the southern and central parts of the Malay Peninsula, and has been classified as critically endangered. As of April 2014[update], the population was estimated at 80–120 mature individuals,with a continuing downward trend. In the Malay language, the tiger is called harimau, also abbreviated to rimau.
