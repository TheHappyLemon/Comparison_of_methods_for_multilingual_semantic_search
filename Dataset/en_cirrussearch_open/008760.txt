Allied health professions (AHPs) are a group of health care professions that provide a range of diagnostic, technical, therapeutic, and support services in connection with health care, and which are distinct from the fields of dentistry, medicine, nursing and pharmacy. In providing care as an AHP, their work may support non-AHP health care roles in providing care, and their work may provide specialty health care that would not otherwise be available. Allied health and care professionals should not be confused with alternative medicine professionals as Allied Health Professional must work within an evidence based practice model. Additionally, some AHPs may also perform the role of Mid-level practitioners with additional education, training and/or certification. Mid-level practitioners are usually AHPs, nurses or other non-physicians with an extended scope of practice.
