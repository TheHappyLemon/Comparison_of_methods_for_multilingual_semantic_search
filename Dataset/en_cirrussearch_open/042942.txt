Roland Walter Ratzenberger (German: [ˈroːlant ˈratsn̩bɛrɡɐ]; 4 July 1960 – 30 April 1994) was an Austrian racing driver who raced in various categories of motorsport, including British Formula 3000, Japanese Formula 3000 and Formula One. Having had sporadic success throughout the lower formulas, Ratzenberger managed to secure an F1 seat in 1994 for the new Simtek team, at the unusually late age of 33. He was killed in a crash during qualifying for the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix just three races into his F1 career. The weekend became notorious for also seeing the death of Ayrton Senna, a three time world champion, during the race the following day. The Grand Prix Drivers' Association was reformed as a direct result of Ratzenberger's death, and the weekend as a whole led to a markedly increased emphasis on safety in the sport.
