Serbia sent two athletes that competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. This was the first and only Olympic Games where Serbia participated as an independent nation until the 2008 Summer Olympics. By the next Olympic Games in 1920, Serbian athletes competed for the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which in 1929 changed its name to Yugoslavia (YUG).
