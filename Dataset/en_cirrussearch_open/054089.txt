Iraz√∫ was the first Costa Rican satellite to be launched into space. The nanosatellite was launched into space on 2 April 2018, on board a Falcon 9 rocket headed for the International Space Station. It was expected to orbit the Earth for six months with the function of monitoring carbon, humidity, and temperature levels in Costa Rican forests. Funds for the launch of satellite were provided, in a significant part, through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign.
