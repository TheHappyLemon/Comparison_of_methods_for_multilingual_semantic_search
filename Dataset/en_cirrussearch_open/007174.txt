2024 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2024 (MMXXIV) is the current year, and is a leap year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar, the 2024th year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 24th year of the 3rd millennium and the 21st century, and the 5th year of the 2020s decade. So far, this year has witnessed the continuation of major armed conflicts, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Myanmar civil war, the war in Sudan, and the Islamist insurgency in the Sahel. The continuation of the Israel–Hamas war has further caused spillover into many countries, including a crisis in the Red Sea impacting global shipping. Approximately 79 countries, representing around four billion people, are expected to conduct national elections throughout the course of the year, including eight out of ten of the world's most populous countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, Pakistan, Russia, India, Mexico, Indonesia, and the United States). The European Parliament will also hold elections.
