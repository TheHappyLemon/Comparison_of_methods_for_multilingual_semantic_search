Loveland is the second solo album by John Sykes, released in 1997. The record was originally pitched to Sykes by Mercury Records' Japanese branch as a seven-track extended play of ballads. Eventually Sykes decided to expand the project into a full-length album. The track "Don't Hurt Me This Way" is a re-recording of Sykes' 1982 single "Please Don't Leave Me", which features late Thin Lizzy frontman Phil Lynott.
