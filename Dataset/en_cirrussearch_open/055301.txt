Wiener Stadthalle (German: [ˈviːnɐ ˈʃtathalə]; English: Viennese City Hall) is a multi-purpose indoor arena and convention center located in the 15th district of Vienna, Austria. Austrian architect Roland Rainer designed the original halls which were constructed between 1953 and 1958, and later expanded in 1974, 1994 and 2006. The main hall, a multi-purpose venue, is Austria's largest indoor arena with a seating capacity of approximately 16,152 people. Since 2006, the complex has housed six main venues (each of which can be used separately or combined) consisting of two gymnasiums, an indoor ice rink, large-capacity indoor arena, a small multi-purpose hall, an auditorium with a show stage and an adjacent swimming pool. It serves as a venue for a variety of events, including concerts, exhibitions, trade fairs, conferences, lectures, theatre, TV and sports. The Wiener Stadthalle is a subsidiary of Wien Holding and stages more than 350 events each year that attract around one million visitors. Halls A, B and C, as well as the Stadthallenbad, are managed by the Viennese sports venues corporation GmbH.
