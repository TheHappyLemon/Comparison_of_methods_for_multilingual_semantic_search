The Irminger Sea is a marginal sea of the North Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered to the west by southern Greenland, to the north by Iceland and the Denmark Strait, to the east by the Reykjanes Ridge (a northern part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge), and to the south by open waters of the North Atlantic. It was named after Danish vice-admiral Carl Ludvig Christian Irminger (1802â€“1888), after whom the Irminger Current was also named.
