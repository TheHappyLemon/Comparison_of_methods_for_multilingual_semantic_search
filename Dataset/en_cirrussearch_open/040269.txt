Johanna Konta (born 17 May 1991) is a British retired tennis player, having represented Australia until 2012. She won four singles titles on the WTA Tour, along with eleven titles in singles and four in doubles on the ITF Women's Circuit. She was British No. 1 and reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 4 on 17 July 2017. She reached the semifinals of the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the French Open. Born to Hungarian parents in Sydney, Australia, Konta moved to England when she was 14. She has Hungarian, Australian and British citizenship. She switched her sporting allegiance from Australia to Great Britain after she became a British citizen in May 2012. Konta achieved a steep rise in her ranking by the WTA from the spring of 2015 to late 2016, climbing from 150th to inside the world's top 10, becoming the first Briton to be ranked amongst the WTA's top ten since Jo Durie was ranked fifth over 30 years prior. This period included her best Grand Slam result up to that time, the semifinals of the 2016 Australian Open, a quarterfinal appearance at the Rio Summer Olympics and her maiden WTA Tour title in Stanford. In 2017, she won the Miami Open and reached the semifinals at Wimbledon. Konta had another successful season in 2019, reaching the semifinals at the French Open and the quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the US Open. Konta retired on 1 December 2021, after struggling with a chronic injury to her right knee, which led to her ranking dropping outside the top 100.
