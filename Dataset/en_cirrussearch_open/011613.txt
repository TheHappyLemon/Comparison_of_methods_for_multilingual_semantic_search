He was selected by the Ottawa Senators in the sixth round, 178th overall, of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. Stone tied Johnny Gaudreau to lead all NHL rookies in scoring during the 2014–15 season with 64 points and received a nomination for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's top rookie. Stone is widely recognized as one of the NHL's premier two-way forwards, and has previously been a finalist for the Frank J. Selke Trophy recognizing this play. During the 2018–19 NHL season, he was traded to Vegas, signed a long-term contract with the team, and was named the first captain in team history in 2021.
