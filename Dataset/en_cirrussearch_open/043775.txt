The Stade Louis II (French pronunciation: [stad(ə) lwi dø], lit. 'Louis II Stadium'), or simply Louis II is a stadium located in the Fontvieille district of Monaco. It serves primarily as a venue for football, being the home of AS Monaco and the Monaco national football team. The stadium is most notable for its distinctive nine arches at the away end of the ground. The arena is also used for the Herculis, a track and field meet of the Diamond League. The stadium hosted the 1986 and 1998–2012 UEFA Super Cup matches. Due to Monaco's small size, the stadium is the only football and athletics stadium in the country.
