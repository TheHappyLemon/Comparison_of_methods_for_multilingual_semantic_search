Kilkim Žaibu (from Lithuanian "arise/soar with the lightning") is an extreme metal festival in Lithuania, held annually since 1999. The festival distinguishes itself from other major metal festivals by incorporating the shows of metal aesthetic-related performers such as medieval folk bands and historical reconstruction clubs, as well as a blacksmith and artisan market. From 2010, the festival has taken place at Lūkstas Lake [lt] in the town of Varniai, Lithuania. Before that, it had been happening at "Plūgo broliai" in Joniškis, Lithuania. Between 2000 and 3000 people[citation needed] visit the festival annually from various countries. Bands have performed at Kilkim Žaibu festivals from Australia, Norway, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, Ukraine, Russia, Sweden, Finland, Germany and neighbouring countries.
