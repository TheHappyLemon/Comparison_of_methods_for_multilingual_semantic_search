Kecskemét (US: /ˈkɛtʃkɛmeɪt/ KETCH-kem-ayt Hungarian: [ˈkɛt͡ʃkɛmeːt]) is a city with county rights in central Hungary. It is the eighth-largest city in the country, and the county seat of Bács-Kiskun. Kecskemét lies halfway between the capital Budapest and the country's third-largest city, Szeged, 86 kilometres (53 miles) from both of them and almost equal distance from the two big rivers of the country, the Danube and the Tisza. It is the northern of two centres of the Hungarian Southern Great Plain (Hungarian: Dél-Alföld) region (comprising the three counties Bács-Kiskun, Békés and Csongrád); the southern centre is Szeged, the seat of Csongrád county.
