Victor Conrad (1876-1962) was an Austrian-American physicist, seismologist, and meteorologist. He was the first director of the Austrian seismological service and a reputed academician of international accomplishment. He was politically victimized twice, in 1919 for his ethnicity and in 1934 as a socialist. He emigrated to the United States in 1938, continuing his academic career in New York, California, and Cambridge. Conrad's scientific work is documented in more than 240 papers concerning meteorology, climatology and seismology. In 1944, he published "Methods in Climatology" (Harvard University Press). Later editions, starting in 1950, listed Leo W. Pollak, as second author. He was the first to deduce the continental crust transition structure which is now named the Conrad discontinuity.
