The FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship is an international volleyball competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), the sport's global governing body. The initial gap between championships was variable, but since 1962 they were held every four years. The tournament will be held biennially starting in 2025. The current champion is Italy, who won their fourth title at the 2022 tournament, defeating Poland in the final. The current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the World Championship Finals. The former format was 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month. The 20 World Championship tournaments have been won by seven different national teams: the Soviet Union six times; Italy four times; Brazil and Poland three times each; Czechoslovakia twice; and East Germany and the United States, once each.
