Esmé William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Penrith, GCB, GCMG, CVO, PC (15 September 1863 – 1 August 1939), was a British diplomat. He served as British Ambassador to the United States between 1924 and 1930. He was one of Britain's most influential diplomats of the early part of the twentieth century. With a gift for languages and a skilled diplomat, Howard is described in his biography as an integral member of the small group of men who made and implemented British foreign policy between 1900 and 1930, a critical transitional period in Britain's history as a world power.
