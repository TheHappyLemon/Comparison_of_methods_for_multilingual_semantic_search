It measured 6.8 on the moment magnitude scale and the maximum felt intensity was VI on the Mercalli intensity scale. It was followed three minutes later by a quake measuring 5.9.

According to the United States Geological Survey, the epicentre was in the Caspian Sea, 25 km to the south-southeast of Baku.
