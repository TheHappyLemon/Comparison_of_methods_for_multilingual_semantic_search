Empoli (Italian pronunciation: [ˈempoli]) is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Florence, Tuscany, Italy, about 30 km (20 miles) southwest of Florence, to the south of the Arno in a plain formed by the river. The plain has been usable for agriculture since Roman times. The commune's territory becomes hilly as it departs from the river. Empoli is on the main railway line from Florence to Pisa, and is the point of divergence of a line to Siena. Empoli has an enduring tradition as an agricultural centre. It has given its name to a local variety of artichoke.
