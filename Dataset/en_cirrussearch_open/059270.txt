Jomsborg or Jómsborg (German: Jomsburg) was a semi-legendary Viking stronghold at the southern coast of the Baltic Sea (medieval Wendland, modern Pomerania), that existed between the 960s and 1043. Its inhabitants were known as Jomsvikings. Jomsborg's exact location, or its existence, has not yet been established, though it is often maintained that Jomsborg was located on the eastern outlet of the Oder river. Historian Lauritz Weibull dismissed Jomsborg as a legend. The only source that mentions a precise location of Jomsborg (53°51′50″N 14°43′05″E﻿ / ﻿53.86389°N 14.71806°E﻿ / 53.86389; 14.71806) is the controversial Gesta Wulinensis ecclesiae pontificum that was discovered in the autumn of 2019.
