Rugova Canyon or Rugova Gorge (Albanian: Gryka e Rugovës) is a river canyon near Peja in Western Kosovo, in the Albanian Alps, close to the border with Montenegro. With a length of 25 km (16 mi) and a depth up to 1,000 meters, Rugova is considered to be one of Europe's longest and deepest canyons. It was created by water erosion and the retreat of the Peja glacier. The Lumbardhi i Pejës river cuts through the canyon. In 1985, Rugova Canyon was declared a protected monument of natural heritage due to its geological, hydrological, speleological and botanic values and its spectacular landscape.
