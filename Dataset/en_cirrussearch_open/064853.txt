L'Officiel, full name L'Officiel de la couture et de la mode de Paris (stylised in all caps), is a French monthly fashion magazine. It has been published in Paris since 1921 and targets upper-income, educated women aged from 25 to 49. A men's edition called L'Officiel Hommes is also published, as are many foreign editions of the magazine. In 2022, it was acquired by AMTD, a Hong Kong-based company.
