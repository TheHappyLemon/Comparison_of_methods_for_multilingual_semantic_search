The king of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Arabic: ملك المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية) is Jordan's head of state and monarch. He serves as the head of the Jordanian monarchy—the Hashemite dynasty. The king is addressed as His Majesty (صاحب الجلالة). Jordan is a constitutional monarchy. However, the king is vested with somewhat more executive and legislative power than is typically the case for constitutional monarchs. He is commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Armed Forces and appoints the Prime Minister of Jordan and the directors of security agencies. He also appoints the members of the upper house, the Senate, as well as the members of the Constitutional Court. The current king, Abdullah II, took the throne on 7 February 1999 following the death of his father, Hussein.
