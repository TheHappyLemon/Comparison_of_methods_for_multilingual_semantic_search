André-Pierre Christian Gignac (born 5 December 1985) is a French professional footballer who plays as a striker for Liga MX club Tigres UANL. Gignac began his career in his home department of Bouches-du-Rhône, playing for local club Fos and Martigues. In 2002, he ventured to the Brittany region to join professional club Lorient. He starred for the club for two seasons, which included a loan stint at amateur club Pau. Gignac joined Toulouse in 2007, amid controversial circumstances. After early struggles, he reached prominence during the 2008–09 season, becoming the league's top scorer with 24 goals. After a sub-par 2009–10 season with Toulouse, Gignac joined the defending champions Marseille in August 2010 on a five-year contract. He scored 77 goals in 186 matches across all competitions for OM, winning two consecutive Coupe de la Ligue titles and the 2011 Trophée des Champions. After his contract expired, he moved to Mexico to play for Tigres UANL, where he has become the club's all-time top scorer in all competitions. Gignac is a France international and made his debut with the team in April 2009 against Lithuania as a result of his good form with Toulouse. He scored his first international goal five months later against the Faroe Islands. Gignac made his first major international appearance for his country at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, featuring in all three matches the team contested. He also represented his country at UEFA Euro 2016, playing in several matches including the final, which France lost to Portugal after extra time.
