The Nizhnyaya Tunguska (Russian: Ни́жняя Тунгу́ска, IPA: [ˈnʲiʐnʲɪjə tʊnˈɡuskə], meaning "Lower Tunguska") is a river in Siberia, Russia, that flows through the Irkutsk Oblast and the Krasnoyarsk Krai. The river is a right tributary of the Yenisey joining it at Turukhansk (see Siberian River Routes). The ice-free period on the Nizhnyaya Tunguska starts in mid-June and ends in the first half of October. The river forms the western limit of the Lena Plateau.
