The Russian December 2021 ultimatum were a set of documents presented by Russia to the United States, NATO, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on 17 December 2021, during the prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The ultimatum outlined Russia's demands and expectations regarding the security situation in Europe, especially in relation to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the future expansion of NATO. The proposals were seen as an attempt by Russia to exert pressure and influence on the Western countries, and as a sign of its dissatisfaction and distrust with the existing security architecture in Europe. The ultimatum was soundly rejected, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine followed two months later.
