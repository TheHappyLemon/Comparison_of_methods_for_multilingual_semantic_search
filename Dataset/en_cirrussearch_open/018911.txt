The Trenčín Region (Slovak: Trenčiansky kraj, pronounced [ˈtrentʂɪɐnski ˈkraj]; Czech: Trenčínský kraj; Hungarian: Trencséni kerület) is one of the eight Slovak administrative regions. It consists of nine districts (okresy). The region was established in 1996: previously it had been a part of the West Slovak Region (Západoslovenský kraj) and partly the Central Slovak Region (Stredoslovenský kraj). Industry is a major sector of the region's economy.
