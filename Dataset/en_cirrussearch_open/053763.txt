The Au Cordon Dor√© at 50 metres event was part of the archery programme at the 1900 Summer Olympics. Qualification for the event was through the large open team events, with the top eight individual archers competing in the individual competition. This was the only one of the four preliminary au berceau archery events in 1900 in which all competitors are named (with scores).
