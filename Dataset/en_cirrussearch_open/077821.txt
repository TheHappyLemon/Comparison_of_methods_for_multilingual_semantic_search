Pokrov Cemetery (Latvian: Pokrova kapi) is a 70,669 square metres (760,670 sq ft) wide cemetery in Riga built in 1773. The current owner of the cemetery is Shelter of Our Most Holy Lady Church who are renting the land. Two Red Army burial sites are located in the cemetery – a smaller one for the summer of 1941 and a bigger one for the years 1944–1946; as well as Russian Empire army's bed of honour dating from 1917. The cemetery also houses Ascension of Christ Church; the only Latvian Orthodox church in Riga where sermons are held in Latvian.
