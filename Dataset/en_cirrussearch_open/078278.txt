Year Zero Remixed (stylized as Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D) is the third remix album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released in the United States on November 20, 2007, and in the United Kingdom six days later. It features remixed versions of tracks from the band's previous studio album Year Zero, created by various producers and recording artists. This album was the last Nine Inch Nails album to be released by Interscope Records; it fulfilled the band's contractual commitments to the company, leaving Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor to proceed as a "totally free agent, free of any recording contract with any label".
