Jonathan Christian David (born January 14, 2000) is a professional soccer player who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Lille and the Canada national team. Born in Brooklyn, United States, David moved to his parents' country of Haiti when he was still a baby, and immigrated to Ottawa, Canada at the age of six. Raised in the Franco-Ontarian community of east Ottawa, he played for several local youth clubs before moving to Belgium in 2018, where he recorded his professional debut for Gent. In 2019, David was named the male Canada Soccer Player of the Year. After two seasons at Gent, David joined French side Lille for a reported â‚¬30 million, making him the most expensive Canadian transfer to date. He would go on to win the Ligue 1 title in his first season at the club.
