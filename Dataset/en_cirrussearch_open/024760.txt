Xherdan Shaqiri (Albanian pronunciation: [dʒɛrˈdan ʃaˈciɾi]; born 10 October 1991) is a Swiss professional footballer who plays as a winger for Major League Soccer club Chicago Fire and the Switzerland national team. Shaqiri rose through the youth ranks at FC Basel. In his three years playing for the Basel first-team, he was an important player in the team that won three Swiss Super League titles. He moved to Bayern Munich in 2012, where he won three Bundesliga titles in his three seasons at the club. He faced stiff competition at Bayern and did not nail down a first-team spot. In January 2015, he moved to Inter Milan for a fee of €15 million. After half a season at Inter, he moved to Stoke City in the summer of 2015 for a club record £12 million. After Stoke's relegation from the Premier League in 2018, Shaqiri was transferred to Liverpool for a reported £13.5 million fee. He was part of the UEFA Champions League winning squad in his first season. He also won the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2019, as well as the Premier League in 2020, Liverpool's first league title in 30 years. A full international since 2010, Shaqiri has earned over 120 caps and scored 30 goals for Switzerland, making him the country's second-most capped player and fourth-highest goalscorer. He represented the nation at the 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022 FIFA World Cups, as well as UEFA Euro 2016 and Euro 2020.
