50 First Dates is a 2004 American romantic comedy film directed by Peter Segal and starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, with Rob Schneider, Sean Astin, Lusia Strus, Blake Clark and Dan Aykroyd in supporting roles. It follows the story of Henry Roth, a womanizing marine veterinarian who falls for an art teacher named Lucy Whitmore. When he discovers she has amnesia, and forgets him when she falls asleep, he resolves to win her over again each new day. Most of the film was shot on location in Oahu, Hawaii, on the Windward side and the North Shore. Sandler and Barrymore won an MTV award for Best On Screen Team. The film received mixed reviews but was a commercial success. It was later remade in India as Satyabhama (2007) (in Telugu) and as Ormayundo Ee Mukham (2014) (in Malayalam), in Japan as 50 First Kisses (2018), in Iran as Chap dast (2005) and in Mexico as Como si fuera la primera vez in 2019. The film marked the second collaboration between Sandler and Barrymore, after The Wedding Singer and before Blended (both directed by Frank Coraci), and also featured a dedication to the memory of Sandler's father Stanley, who had passed away at the age of 68 from lung cancer on September 9, 2003, during the end credits.
