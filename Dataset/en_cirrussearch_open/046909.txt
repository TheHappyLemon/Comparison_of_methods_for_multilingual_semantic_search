Dumbarton Football Club is a semi-professional football club in Dumbarton, Scotland. Founded on 23 December 1872, they are one of the oldest football clubs in Scotland. The club plays home games at the Dumbarton Football Stadium next to Dumbarton Castle. They were one of the most successful of the nineteenth century, winning the Scottish Football League in the first two seasons of the competition (the first jointly with Rangers). The club ceased playing in 1901 and did not return to action until 1905. Although at the time it was emphasised that this was a new club, subsequent directives by the SFA and Scottish Combination appear to countermand this, possibly to fast-track the re-formed club into their competitions. Since then, the club have spent the majority of their history outside the top flight, with their last appearance at the top level coming in 1984â€“85 and the side currently playing in Scottish League Two. The club were the first team (and one of only two) to win at least one league title in each of the top four tiers in the Scottish football league system. Stephen Farrell is the club's manager, having been appointed in May 2021. In May 2021, it was announced that Dumbarton were to change ownership, with previous owners Brabco selling their majority share to Cognitive Capital.
