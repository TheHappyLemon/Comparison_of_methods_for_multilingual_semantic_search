Etchegaray (Basque: Etxegarai, forename unknown) was a French Basque pelotari who competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. Etchegaray competed in the only official pelota contest in Olympic history, the Basque pelota at the 1900 Summer Olympics two-man teams event. He and his partner Maurice Durquetty withdrew before the event, thus losing by forfeit to the team of Spain, José de Amézola y Aspizúa and Francisco Villota.
