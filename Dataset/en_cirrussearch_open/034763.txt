Daugavgr카va Lighthouse (Latvian: Daugavgr카vas b훮ka) is a lighthouse located in Daugavgr카va on the Bay of Riga on the Latvian coast of the Baltic Sea. The lighthouse was built in 1956, located next to Daugava River. Due to the change in the river's course, several lighthouses have been built, destroyed, and rebuilt again over the course of history.
