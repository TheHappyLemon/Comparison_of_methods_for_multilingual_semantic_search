Johann Friedrich Ludwig Christoph Jahn (11 August 1778 – 15 October 1852) was a German gymnastics educator and nationalist whose writing is credited with the founding of the German gymnastics (Turner) movement as well as influencing the German Campaign of 1813, during which a coalition of German states effectively ended the occupation by Napoleon's First French Empire. His admirers know him as "Turnvater Jahn", roughly meaning "Father of Gymnastics Jahn". Jahn invented the parallel bars, rings, high bar, the pommel horse and the vault horse.
