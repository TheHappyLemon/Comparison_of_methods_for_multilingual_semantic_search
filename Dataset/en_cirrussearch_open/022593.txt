The province of Rome (Italian: provincia di Roma) was one of the five provinces that formed part of the Lazio region of Italy. It was established in 1870 and disestablished in 2014. It was essentially coterminous with the Rome metropolitan area. The city of Rome was the provincial capital. During the 1920s, the boundary of the province shrank as land was ceded to establish new provinces. The province of Rome was the most populous province in Italy. On 1 January 2015, it was superseded by a new local government bodyâ€”the Metropolitan City of Rome Capital.
