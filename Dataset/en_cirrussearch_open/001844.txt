.cl is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Chile. It was created in 1987 and is administered by the University of Chile. Registration of second-level domains under this TLD is open to anyone, as established by the current regulation for the operation of the Domain Name Registration .CL since December 2013, which eliminated the requirement for foreign registrants to have a local contact with a RUN, the Chilean national identification number. Registration of names including accented letters (á, é, í, ó, ú), ñ and ü was opened up in 2005. Since April 2011, it supports DNSSEC. Microsoft used it in a domain hack for its social networking service so.cl. Oracle Corporation used the domain hack ora.cl as a URL shortening
