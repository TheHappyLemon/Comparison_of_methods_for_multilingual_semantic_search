Vanitas (Latin for 'vanity', in this context meaning pointlessness, or futility, not to be confused with the other defintion of vanity) is a genre of art which uses symbolism to show the transience of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death, and thus the vanity of ambition and all worldy desires. The paintings involved still life imagery of transitory items. The genre began in the 16th century and continued into the 17th century. Vanitas art is a type of allegorical art representing a higher ideal. It was a sub-genre of painting heavily employed by Dutch painters during the Baroque period (c.1585â€“1730). Spanish painters working at the end of the Spanish Golden Age also created vanitas paintings.
