The École de Management de Normandie (also known as EM Normandie Business School) is a business school created in 1871. Incorporated as a Higher Education & Research non-profit association (under the 1901 Act) and operating under private law, it has campuses in Caen, Dublin, Le Havre, Oxford, Paris and Dubai. It is one of the oldest business schools in France and worldwide, and holds a triple accreditation by EQUIS, AACSB, and AMBA. In 2015, EM Normandie was selected to appear in the ranking of the Financial Times of the best masters in management in the world (69th). In January 2013, EM Normandie launched its new “Values & Performance” Strategic Plan, to guarantee further strategic consistency, to capitalize on its multi-campus experience, to apply active learning, and to serve the Normandy territory in partnership with its entire business community. This has brought new dimensions to the School's ambitions and reputation, thanks to the La SmartEcole® project and further partnerships with the University of Caen Normandy and the Grenoble School of Management.
