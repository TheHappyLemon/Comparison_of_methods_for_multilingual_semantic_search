Monta Kroma (February 27, 1919 – July 25, 1994) was a Latvian writer, best known for her pioneering modernist poetry. She is considered one of the most influential 20th-century Latvian poets, and one of the most unusual and radical of the Soviet era. Having enlisted in the Red Army during World War II, Kroma initially wrote patriotic socialist realist verse, but she eventually transitioned into avant-garde free verse poetry, most notably in her 1970 collection Lūpas.
