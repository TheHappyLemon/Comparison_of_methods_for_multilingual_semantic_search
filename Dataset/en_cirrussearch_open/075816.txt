.dz is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Algeria (from Dzayer, the local name for Algeria). It is administered by the DZ Network Internet Center, a subdivision of CERIST (Centre de Recherche sur l'Information Scientifique et Technique). To apply for a .dz domain name, one must be an entity established in Algeria and/or having legal representation in Algeria and/or having a document justifying the name ownership rights in the country. Currently, NIC.DZ charges 1000 Algerian dinars per year for a domain (about US$7.4).
