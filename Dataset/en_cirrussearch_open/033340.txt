Justin Schultz (born July 6, 1990) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman for the Seattle Kraken of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has previously played in the NHL for the Edmonton Oilers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals. Schultz won back-to-back Stanley Cups with the Penguins in 2016 and 2017. Schultz was born in Kelowna, British Columbia, and grew up in the nearby City of West Kelowna. Growing up in Kelowna, Schultz played three seasons of Junior A ice hockey with the Westside Warriors of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). During his rookie season with the Warriors, he began to draw interest from hockey scouts and was named on the NHL Central Scouting Bureau's rankings. Schultz was eventually drafted 43rd overall by the Anaheim Ducks in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. Following the BCHL, Schultz played Division 1 collegiate hockey for the Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey team at the University of Wisconsin for three years. He had a successful collegiate career where he set numerous program records. He became the third player in WCHA history to win two WCHA Defensive Player of the Year awards as he also became the first Badger defenseman to lead a team in goal scoring. As Schultz was unable to come to a contract agreement with the Ducks, he was heavily recruited by nearly all NHL teams following his junior year. He eventually chose to sign with the Edmonton Oilers on June 30, 2012, and remained with the organization for four seasons before being traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.
