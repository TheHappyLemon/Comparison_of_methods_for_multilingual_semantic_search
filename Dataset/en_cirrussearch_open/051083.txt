JY1-SAT is a cubesat that is Jordan's first satellite. It was launched aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9 from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in the United States on 3 December 2018. It is named in tribute of the late King Hussein who was an amateur ham radio operator; his callsign was "JY1". The project was built by Jordanian students from various universities, and was funded by Jordan's Crown Prince Foundation.
