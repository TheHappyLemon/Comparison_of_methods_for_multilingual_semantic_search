The University of Dhaka (Bengali: ঢাকা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়; also known as Dhaka University or DU) is a public research university located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It was established in 1921 as University of Dacca and it is the oldest active university in Bangladesh. The university was founded in 1921 under the Dacca University Act 1920 of the Indian Legislative Council. Nawab Bahadur Sir Khwaja Salimullah, who pioneered the university in Dhaka, donated 600 acres of land from his estate for this purpose. It is modeled after British Universities. Currently it is the largest public research university in Bangladesh, with a student body of 46,150 and a faculty of 1,992. It has made significant contributions to the modern history of Bangladesh. After the Partition of India, it became the focal point of progressive and democratic movements in Pakistan. Its students and teachers played a central role in the rise of Bengali nationalism and the independence of Bangladesh in 1971.[citation needed] Notable alumni include Satyendra Nath Bose, known for Bose–Einstein statistics and the theory of Bose–Einstein condensate, Muhammad Yunus (winner 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, pioneer of microcredit), Muhammad Shahidullah, Natyaguru Nurul Momen Pioneer of Cultural & theatric activities of Dhaka University (He was both a student of DU & later a teacher), Serajul Islam Choudhury (the country's leading public intellectual and writer), Mohammad Ataul Karim (physicist), Buddhadeb Bose (20th-century Bengali poet) and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (the founding father of Bangladesh but he never got any degree from DU).[citation needed]
