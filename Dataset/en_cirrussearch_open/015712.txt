"Let Yourself Go" is a song by American rock band Green Day. The song is featured as the fourth track on their ninth studio album ¡Uno! (2012). Written by Billie Joe Armstrong and produced by Rob Cavallo, the song was released as the third and final single from the album on September 5, 2012. However, the "official live video" of the song was revealed on August 1, 2012. It is also the third single from the ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! & ¡Tré! trilogy. The song was described to be "more punk" than that of the band's previous two singles "Oh Love" and "Kill the DJ", and was compared to their 1990s material, such as Dookie and Insomniac. Its theme was described as "the kind of pop-smart here's-my-fucking-problem miniatures". It received positive critical reception and charted at number 2 on the UK Rock Chart and 17 on the US Alternative Songs chart. "Let Yourself Go" was played at secret shows of the band and at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards.
