Bregenz (German: [ˈbʁeːɡɛnts] ; Vorarlbergian: Breagaz [ˈb̥rea̯ɡ̊ats]) is the capital of Vorarlberg, the westernmost state of Austria. The city lies on the east and southeast shores of Lake Constance, the third-largest freshwater lake in Central Europe, between Switzerland in the west and Germany in the northwest. Bregenz is located on a plateau falling in a series of terraces to the lake at the foot of Pfänder mountain. It is a junction of the arterial roads from the Rhine valley to the German Alpine foothills, with cruise ship services on Lake Constance. It is famous for the annual summer music festival Bregenzer Festspiele, as well as the dance festival Bregenzer Spring.
