Hard Candy is the eleventh studio album by American singer and songwriter Madonna. Released by Warner Bros. Records on April 19, 2008, it was her last album for the company after a 25-year history. Madonna began working on Hard Candy in early 2007, and collaborated with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, the Neptunes, and Nate "Danja" Hills to produce a dance-pop album incorporating hip hop, electropop, disco, electro, funk, and R&B. For the album's creation, Madonna wanted to portray an alter-ego dubbed as the "black Madonna", but it was later scrapped due to the fact that it would be controversial. Critical reaction was generally favorable, and Hard Candy debuted at number one in 37 countries worldwide, becoming the year's eleventh best-selling album, exceeding 4 million copies. The album's lead single was a worldwide success, with "4 Minutes" topping the charts in 21 countries and becoming Madonna's 37th Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit. Madonna performed in small venues in three cities to promote the album. She subsequently embarked on the Sticky & Sweet Tour, which became the highest-grossing concert tour by a female artist.
