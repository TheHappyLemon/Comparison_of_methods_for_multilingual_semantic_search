A. Le Coq (Estonian pronunciation: [ˈɑ.le ˈkokˑ]) is an Estonian brewery. The company was founded in 1807 by a Prussian family of the same name, who were descendants of the Huguenots who had fled France in the 17th century. The company was bought in 1997 and is currently owned by Finnish company Olvi. It produces many types of drinks including beers, long drinks, ciders and soft drinks. The best known beer is the A. Le Coq Premium, which is the most popular beer in Estonia, according to the latest AC Nielsen results in October 2008. A. Le Coq Arena in Tallinn was named after the beer. Its motto is Asi on maitses, meaning 'it's about the taste'. A song with this name by rock band Smilers was also specifically written and is used in commercials.
