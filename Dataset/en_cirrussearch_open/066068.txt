The Syria national football team (Arabic: منتخب سُورِيَا لِكُرَّةُ الْقَدَم) represents Syria in international football, and is controlled by the Syrian Arab Federation for Football, the governing body for football in Syria. Syria has never qualified for the World Cup finals, but did reach the fourth qualification round in 2018. The team is currently banned by FIFA from playing at home, as they have not hosted a game since December 2010. Internationally, Syria won the 2012 WAFF Championship, 1957 Arab Games and the 1987 Mediterranean Games.
