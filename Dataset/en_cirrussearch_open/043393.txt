Salvatore "Totò" Schillaci Cavaliere OMRI (Italian pronunciation: [salvaˈtoːre toˈtɔ skilˈlaːtʃi]; born 1 December 1964) is an Italian former professional footballer, who played as a striker. During his club career, he played for Messina (1982–1989), Juventus (1989–1992), Internazionale (1992–1994) and Júbilo Iwata (1994–1997). At the international level he was the surprise star of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, as he helped Italy to a third-place finish on home soil. Coming on as substitute in Italy's first game, Schillaci went on to score six goals throughout the World Cup, claiming the Golden Boot as the leading goalscorer, and received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament ahead of Lothar Matthäus and Diego Maradona, who came second and third respectively. That year he also placed second in the 1990 Ballon d'Or, behind Matthäus.
