Eurovision Choir (formerly Eurovision Choir of the Year) is a choral competition organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and Interkultur [de]. It is modeled after the latter's World Choir Games. Participation is open to non-professional choirs selected by member broadcasters of the EBU. The inaugural competition took place in 2017 in Riga, Latvia, and was won by Slovenia. The second edition took place in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2019 and was won by Denmark. Planning for a third edition was canceled in June 2021 by the Interkultur [de]; a host broadcaster for the event had not been selected before the announcement, nor had any countries announced their participation. In October 2022, it was announced by the EBU that Eurovision Choir would return in 2023, hosted by Latvijas Televīzija for the second time in the contest's history. However on 17 May 2023, the EBU announced that the 2023 edition had been cancelled. No host city or venue had been revealed before the cancellation. The official list of participants was also not released before the cancellation, however, five countries had confirmed their intention to participate. Following the cancellation of the 2021 and 2023 contests, the future of the Eurovision Choir remains uncertain. The EBU has not yet stated whether or not Eurovision Choir will return in the future. If it goes ahead, the next contest is expected to occur in 2025.
