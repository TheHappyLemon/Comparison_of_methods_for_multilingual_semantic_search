Coreoidea is a superfamily of true bugs in the infraorder Pentatomomorpha which includes leaf-footed bugs and allies. There are more than 3,300 described species in Coreoidea. There are five extant families presently recognized, but the Coreoidea as a whole are part of a close-knit group with the Lygaeoidea and Pyrrhocoroidea and it is likely that these three superfamilies are paraphyletic to a significant extent; they are therefore in need of revision and redelimitation. The families are: Alydidae Amyot & Serville, 1843 – broad-headed bugs Coreidae Leach, 1815 – leaf-footed bugs and squash bugs Hyocephalidae Bergroth, 1906 Rhopalidae – scentless plant bugs Stenocephalidae Amyot & Serville, 1843 † Trisegmentatidae Zhang, Sun & Zhang, 1994 † Yuripopovinidae Azar, Nel, Engel, Garrouste & Matocq, 2011 † Pachymeridiidae Handlirsch, 1906
