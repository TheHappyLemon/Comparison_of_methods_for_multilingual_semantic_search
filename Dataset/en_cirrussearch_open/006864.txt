.mv is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Republic of Maldives. It is administered by Dhiraagu Pvt Ltd, a telecommunications company. Mainly due to the unavailability of an online registration service, a whois lookup and large maintenance cost, the Maldivian ccTLD is used predominantly by government agencies and large businesses. Smaller companies and organizations prefer generic TLDs such as .com and .net.
