VEF, Latvian acronym for Valsts elektrotehniskā fabrika (State Electrotechnical Factory), was a manufacturer of electrical and electronic products in Riga, Latvia. It was founded in 1919. Before World War II, it manufactured a large variety of goods, including Minox — then the world's smallest camera. After the war, it was the leading communication technology producer in the Soviet Union and the largest factory in the Latvian SSR.
