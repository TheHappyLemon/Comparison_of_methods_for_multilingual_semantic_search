Spiš (Latin: Cips/Zepus/Scepus/Scepusia/Scepusium, Polish: Spisz, Hungarian: Szepesség/Szepes, German: Zips) is a region in north-eastern Slovakia, with a very small area in south-eastern Poland (more specifically encompassing 14 villages). Spiš is an informal designation of the territory, but it is also the name of one of the 21 official tourism regions of Slovakia. The region is not an administrative division in its own right, but between the late 11th century and 1920 it was an administrative county of the Kingdom of Hungary (see separate article Szepes County in this regard).
