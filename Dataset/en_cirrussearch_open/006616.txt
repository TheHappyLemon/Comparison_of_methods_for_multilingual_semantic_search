This is a list of Belgian monarchs from 1831 when the first Belgian king, Leopold I, ascended the throne, after Belgium seceded from the Kingdom of the Netherlands during the Belgian Revolution of 1830. Under the Belgian Constitution, the Belgian monarch is styled "King of the Belgians" (French: Roi des Belges, Dutch: Koning der Belgen, German: KÃ¶nig der Belgier) rather than "King of Belgium" in order to reflect the monarchy's constitutional and popular function. Since 1831, there have been seven Kings of the Belgians and two regents.
