Interpol is an American rock band from Manhattan, New York. Formed in 1997, their original line-up consisted of Paul Banks (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Daniel Kessler (lead guitar, backing vocals), Carlos Dengler (bass guitar, keyboards), and Greg Drudy (drums). Drudy left the band in 2000 and was replaced by Sam Fogarino. Dengler left to pursue other projects in 2010, with Banks taking on the additional role of bassist instead of hiring a new one. Having first performed at Luna Lounge alongside peers such as the Strokes, Longwave, the National, and Stellastarr, Interpol is one of the bands associated with the New York indie music scene and one of several groups that emerged from the post-punk revival of the 2000s. The band's sound is generally a mix of staccato bass and rhythmic, harmonized guitar with a snare-heavy mix, drawing comparisons to post-punk bands such as Joy Division, Television and the Chameleons, and also to Echo & the Bunnymen and Siouxsie and the Banshees. The band has no primary songwriter, with each member contributing to composition. Interpol's debut album Turn On the Bright Lights (2002) was critically acclaimed, making it to No. 10 on NME's list of the top albums of the year and No. 1 on Pitchfork Media's list of the top 50 albums of the year. Subsequent records Antics (2004) and Our Love to Admire (2007) brought greater critical and commercial success. The band released its self-titled fourth album in September 2010, then went on hiatus while they focused on other projects. Their fifth studio album, El Pintor, was released in September 2014. The band embarked on an anniversary tour for Turn On the Bright Lights in 2017, performing the album live in its entirety. The band's sixth studio album, Marauder, was released in August 2018, and their seventh, The Other Side of Make-Believe, in July 2022.
