The sieges of Riga were two sieges which took place on February 22 and June 15, 1700, in Riga: 687  during the Great Northern War. The Swedish garrison of about 4,000 men under the command of Erik Dahlberg successfully repulsed the Saxons until the main Swedish army under Charles XII of Sweden arrived to sweep the Saxons away in the battle of Riga which ended the period of sieges for the year. The successful attempt to take the city from Sweden was made in the siege of Riga (1710) by the Russians under Peter the Great.
