Jēkabpils (Latvian: [ˈjeːkapːils] ) is a state city in Jēkabpils Municipality in southeastern Latvia, located roughly halfway between the capital Riga and Daugavpils, and spanning the Daugava River. The name of the city literally translates into "City of Jacob". Historic Jēkabpils lies on the left bank, in Selonia, while the historic Krustpils (German: Kreutzburg) lies on the right bank, in Latgale. The two cities were united during the Soviet rule in 1962 under the Jēkabpils name, but retain their distinct regional character. Jēkabpils was also formerly home to the Soviet Jēkabpils Air Base.
