Riga International Short Film Festival 2ANNAS (Latvian: Rīgas Starptautiskais īsfilmu festivāls 2ANNAS) is the only annual short film festival in Latvia. Founded by its current director Viesturs Grazdanovics (Viesturs Graždanovičs) in 1996, the festival has since taken place every year in late May, until in 2013 it moved to late October in Riga (Latvia). Screenings take place in several film theaters as well as popular alternative entertainment venues and non-conventional screening venues. Originally created to promote short film, the festival has widened its range by adding a feature film competition program in its 2014 selection.
