Oggy and the Cockroaches: The Movie (French: Oggy et les Cafards: Le Film) is a 2013 French animated anthology comedy film directed and written by Olivier Jean-Marie, that premiered in France on August 7, 2013, to May 20-7. The film is based on the series Oggy and the Cockroaches, a silent slapstick comedy series similar to that of Hanna-Barbera's Tom and Jerry. This is the last film Olivier Jean-Marie made before his death on May 13, 2021. The film revolves around the eponymous characters' adventures throughout four timelines, composed of self-contained stories in a chronological order. These stories also feature Jack, Bob and Olivia. The basis of the movie also became the theme of the fifth season of Oggy and the Cockroaches, which also took place in a variety of countries, like Ancient Egypt and China, within three, separately self-contained episodes.
