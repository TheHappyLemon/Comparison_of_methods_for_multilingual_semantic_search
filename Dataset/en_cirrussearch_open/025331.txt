Bárðarbunga (Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈpaurðarˌpuŋka] ), is an active stratovolcano located under Vatnajökull in Vatnajökull National Park which is Iceland's most extensive glacier. The second highest mountain in Iceland, 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) above sea level, Bárðarbunga is also part of the Bárðarbunga-Veiðivötn volcanic system that is approximately 190 kilometres (120 mi) long and 25 kilometres (16 mi) wide. Bárðarbunga erupted in late August 2014, the eruption style effusive, which is common in Iceland, but had not been seen for a few years. Lava covered the surrounding landscape near the Vatnajökull glacier. The Vatnajökull glacier is home to 7 volcanos, all being active. The Grímsvötn volcano, which is the most active in Iceland, last erupted in May 2011. Bárðdarbunga is part of this system and is the second most active in it.
