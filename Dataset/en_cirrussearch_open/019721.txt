Sulfuric(IV) acid (United Kingdom spelling: sulphuric(IV) acid), also known as sulfurous (UK: sulphurous) acid and thionic acid,[citation needed] is the chemical compound with the formula H2SO3. Raman spectra of solutions of sulfur dioxide in water show only signals due to the SO2 molecule and the bisulfite ion, HSO−3. The intensities of the signals are consistent with the following equilibrium: SO2 + H2O ⇌ HSO−3 + H+          Ka = 1.54×10−2; pKa = 1.81. 17O NMR spectroscopy provided evidence that solutions of sulfurous acid and protonated sulfites contain a mixture of isomers, which is in equilibrium: [H−OSO2]− ⇌ [H−SO3]− Attempts to concentrate the solutions of sulfurous acid simply reverses the equilibrium, producing sulfur dioxide and water vapor. A clathrate with the formula 4SO2·23H2O has been crystallised. It decomposes above 7 °C.
