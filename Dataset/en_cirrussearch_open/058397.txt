Pedro Pablo Pichardo Peralta (Spanish pronunciation: [piˈtʃaɾðo], Portuguese pronunciation: [piˈʃaɾðu]; born 30 June 1993) is a Cuban-born Portuguese triple jumper who holds the current Olympic and European titles. He won the gold medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics with a Portuguese national record of 17.98 m (58 ft 11+3⁄4 in). He was world champion in 2022, and could not defend his title in 2023 due to injury. Pichardo was the 2012 World Junior Champion and the 2013 World Championship silver medalist. His 17.79 m (58 ft 4+1⁄4 in) in early 2014 was the best triple jump of the year. In 2015, his 17.94 m (58 ft 10+1⁄4 in) made him the #6 performer ever. A week later he improved to 18.06 m (59 ft 3 in), making him the No. 3 performer ever and the best performance the world has seen since 1996 (when Pichardo was only three years old). At club level, he represents Benfica in Portugal.
