Theanine /ˈθiːəniːn/, commonly known as L-theanine and sometimes L-gamma-glutamylethylamide or N5-ethyl-L-glutamine, is an amino acid analogue of the proteinogenic amino acids L-glutamate and L-glutamine and is found primarily in particular plant and fungal species. It was discovered as a constituent of green tea in 1949 and isolated from gyokuro leaves in 1950, thus rendering it a natural product. It constitutes about 1–2% of the dry weight of green tea leaves. The name theanine without a prefix generally implies the enantiomer, L-theanine, which is the form found in tea leaves from which it is extracted as a powder. The right-handed enantiomer, D-theanine, has been comparatively studied less. Theanine is sold as a dietary supplement and is considered to be safe at doses up to 250 milligrams (mg) by the US Food and Drug Administration. It is packaged in gelatin capsules, tablets, and as a powder, and may be an ingredient in branded supplements with caffeine. The European Food Safety Authority found there was insufficient evidence for a causal relationship between theanine consumption and improved cognitive function, alleviation of psychological stress, maintenance of normal sleep, or reduction of menstrual discomfort.
