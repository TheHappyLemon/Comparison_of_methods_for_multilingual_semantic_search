The World Aquatics Swimming Championships (25m), formerly known as the FINA World Swimming Championships (25m), also referred to as 'short course worlds', are an international swimming competition staged by the internationally recognized governing body of the sport, World Aquatics (formerly FINA). The championships are staged in a 25m pool, referred to as short course format, and traditionally have been held biennially in alternate years to the World Aquatics Championships. Unlike the World Aquatics Championships, only swimming events are staged at these championships (being one of the six disciplines that form part of the World Aquatics Championships).
