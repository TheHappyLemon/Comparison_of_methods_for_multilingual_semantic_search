The Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy (also sometimes referred to as the Cornetto trilogy or the Blood and Ice Cream trilogy) is an anthology series of British comedic genre films directed by Edgar Wright, written by Wright and Simon Pegg, and produced by Nira Park. The series stars Pegg, Nick Frost, and Bill Nighy, with several other actors, including Rafe Spall and Martin Freeman, also appearing in all three films. The trilogy consists of Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), and The World's End (2013). The trilogy of films does not share a storyline, and is named after its repeated passing references to Cornetto ice cream cones. Produced on a combined budget of $38 million, the films grossed $156 million worldwide and garnered critical praise. In addition to brief references to the Cornetto ice cream brand, the films plots have other common elements: each depicts romance and struggles with maturity. The name is also a reference to the French Three Colours trilogy (1993–1994) by director Krzysztof Kieślowski.
