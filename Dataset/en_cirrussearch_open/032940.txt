The 17th Chess Olympiad (Spanish: La 17a Olimpíada de ajedrez), organized by FIDE and comprising an open team tournament, as well as several other events designed to promote the game of chess, took place between October 23 and November 20, 1966, in Havana, Cuba. The Soviet team with 6 GMs, led by world champion Petrosian, lived up to expectations and won their eighth consecutive gold medals, with the United States and Hungary taking the silver and bronze, respectively. When Hungary and Yugoslavia tied on both game and match points, and they had drawn 2–2 with each other, the rules dictated that the final ranking would be decided by using the Neustadtl score – but not which version of it. A so-called unweighted score was used, which placed Hungary ahead of Yugoslavia, giving them the bronze medals. Had the weighted variant been used instead, the result would have been the other way around.
