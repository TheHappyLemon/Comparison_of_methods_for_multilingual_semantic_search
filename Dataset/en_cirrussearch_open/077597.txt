The Tibetan brown bear (Ursus arctos pruinosus), also known as Tibetan blue bear, is a subspecies of the brown bear (Ursus arctos) in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. One of the rarest subspecies of bear in the world, the blue bear is rarely sighted in the wild. First classified in 1851, it was once known in the Western world only through a small number of fur and bone samples. However, the 2021 French documentary The Velvet Queen (La Panth√®re des Neiges) did manage to capture extensive footage of the reclusive animal.
