Maranao (Filipino: Mëranaw; Kirim: باسا أ مراناو) is an Austronesian language spoken by the Maranao people in the provinces of Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte and the cities of Marawi and Iligan City in the Philippines, as well as in Sabah, Malaysia. It is a subgroup of the Danao languages of the Moros in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Iranun was once considered a dialect of Maranao. Unique among other Danao languages, Maranao is spoken with a distinct downstep accent, as opposed to stress accent.[citation needed] Additionally, Maranao features aspirated "hard consonants", which also raise the quality of following vowels.
