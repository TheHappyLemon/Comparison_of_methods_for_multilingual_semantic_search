Salzburg (Austrian German: [ˈsaltsbʊʁk], German: [ˈzaltsbʊʁk] ;Austro-Bavarian: Soizbuag, also known as Salzburgerland; Italian: Salisburghese) is an Austrian federal state. In German it is called a Bundesland, a German-to-English dictionary translates that to federal state and the European Commission calls it a province. In German, its official name is Land Salzburg, to distinguish it from its eponymous capital Salzburg. For centuries, it was an independent Prince-Bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire.
