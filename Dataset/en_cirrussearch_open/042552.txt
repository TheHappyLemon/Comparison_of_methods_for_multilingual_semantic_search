The Serbian eagle (Serbian Cyrillic: Српски орао, romanized: Srpski orao) is a double-headed heraldic eagle, also known as the White eagle (Serbian Cyrillic: Бели орао, romanized: Beli orao), a common symbol in the history of Serbian heraldry and vexillology. The double-headed eagle and the Serbian cross are the main heraldic symbols which represent the national identity of the Serbian people across the centuries, originating from the medieval Nemanjić dynasty. The eagle, defaced with the cross, has been used in the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbia from 1882 to 1918 and in contemporary coat of arms of the Republic of Serbia since 2004.
