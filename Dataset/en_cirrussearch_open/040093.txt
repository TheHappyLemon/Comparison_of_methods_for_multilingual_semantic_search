Football Club Torpedo Moscow (Russian: ФК "Торпедо" Москва, FK Torpedo Moskva), known as Torpedo Moscow, is a Russian professional football club based in Moscow that competes in the Russian First League, the second tier of Russian football, after being relegated from the Russian Premier League in the 2022–23 season. Their colours are white and black, with green also commonly being associated with the club. They play their home games at Eduard Streltsov Stadium, but have been playing at Luzhniki Stadium since their home stadium began a reconstruction project in 2021. The new stadium is designed by the architects Michel REMON and Alexis PEYER from the French office MR&A. Torpedo are historically one of the big Moscow clubs who enjoyed great domestic success during the Soviet era. In recent history, however, the club has suffered from financial troubles and poor management which has seen them drop down the divisions. A top flight club since promotion in 1938, Torpedo were relegated for the first time in their history following the 2006 Russian Premier League season and have only played two campaigns in the top division since, in 2014–15 and 2022-23, being relegated in both top-flight seasons after finishing in relegation spots, while spending the other seasons bouncing around between the second and third tiers.
