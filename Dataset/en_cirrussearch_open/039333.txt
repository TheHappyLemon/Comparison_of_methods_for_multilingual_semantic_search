The winner of the Eurovision Song Contest is selected by a positional voting system. The most recent system was implemented in the 2023 contest, and sees each participating country award two sets of 12, 10, 8â€“1 points to their ten favourite songs: one set from their professional jury and the other from televoting, with only televoting used in the semi-finals, and both jury and televoting in the final.
