World Aquatics, formerly known as FINA (French: Fédération internationale de natation; English: International Swimming Federation), is the international federation recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for administering international competitions in water sports. It is one of several international federations which administer a given sport or discipline for both the IOC and the international community. It is based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Founded as FINA (Fédération internationale de natation; International Swimming Federation) in 1908, the federation was officially renamed World Aquatics in January 2023. World Aquatics currently oversees competition in six aquatics sports: swimming, diving, high diving, artistic swimming, water polo, and open water swimming. World Aquatics also oversees "Masters" competition (for adults) in its disciplines.
