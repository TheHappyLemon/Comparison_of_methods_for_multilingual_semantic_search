Sandra Perković Elkasević (born 21 June 1990) is a Croatian discus thrower. She is a two-time Olympic (2012 London, 2016 Rio) and world (2013, 2017) champion and a record six-time European champion (2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2022) which no other female athlete achieved. She is also a six-time Diamond League winner, prevailing in 46 circuit's meetings. Elkasević culminated her successful junior career by winning gold at the 2009 European Junior Championships with a new national record. A month later, she made the final of the World Championships as the youngest discus thrower in the field. In her first year of senior competition she won gold at the 2010 European Championships, becoming the youngest ever European champion in the women's discus throw. A six-month doping suspension after testing positive for a banned psychostimulant kept her out of competition for most of the 2011 season, including the World Championships, but she successfully defended her title at the 2012 European Championships. She is coached by Edis Elkasević, whom she married in 2023. Her personal best and national record is 71.41 metres, set in July 2017 at the Galà dei Castelli meeting in Bellinzona, Switzerland. At the time, it was the longest discus throw by a female athlete in 25 years. She became a member of the Croatian Parliament after the 2015 general election for the 8th Sabor. She was MP for less than a year.
