Braden Holtby (born September 16, 1989) is a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who is an unrestricted free agent. He previously played for the Washington Capitals, Vancouver Canucks and Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the fourth round, 93rd overall, of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft by the Capitals, with whom he spent the first ten seasons of his career. After a couple years of development, Holtby became the Capitals' starting goaltender during the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season. Beginning during the 2014–15 season, Holtby won at least 40 games in three consecutive seasons. In 2016, Holtby tied the league record for most wins by a goaltender in a single season (shared with Martin Brodeur) with 48 and was awarded the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender. The following year, he won the William M. Jennings Trophy for helping the Capitals allow the fewest goals in the league. In 2018, Holtby backstopped the Capitals to their first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history.
