Kyrenia Castle (Greek: Κάστρο της Κερύνειας Turkish: Girne Kalesi) at the east end of the old harbour in Kyrenia is a 16th-century castle built by the Venetians over a previous Crusader fortification. Within its walls lies a twelfth-century chapel showing reused late Roman capitals, and the Shipwreck Museum.
