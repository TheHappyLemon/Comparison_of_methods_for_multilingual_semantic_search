Skogskyrkogården (pronounced [ˈskûːɡsɕʏrkʊˌɡoːɖɛn]; Swedish for 'The Woodland Cemetery') is a cemetery located in the Gamla Enskede district south of central Stockholm, Sweden. It was inaugurated in 1920 and was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994. Its design, by Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz, reflects the development of architecture from Nordic Classicism to mature functionalism.
