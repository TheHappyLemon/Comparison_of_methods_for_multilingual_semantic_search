Gazzy Garcia (born August 17, 2000), known professionally as Lil Pump, is an American rapper and singer-songwriter. He rose to prominence as part of the SoundCloud rap scene in the late 2010s, gaining distinction for his minimalist music and rambunctious public persona. Born and raised in Miami, Florida, he gained mainstream attention following the release of his 2017 single "Gucci Gang", which peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and preceded his self-titled debut studio album in October of that year. "Gucci Gang", despite being panned by critics and audiences, was certified five-times platinum by the RIAA, while the album of which it preceded peaked at number three on the Billboard 200. In the following two years, he saw continued success with his singles "I Love It" (with Kanye West featuring Adele Givens), "Esskeetit", "Drug Addicts", "Butterfly Doors", "Be Like Me" (featuring Lil Wayne), and "Welcome to the Party" (with Diplo and French Montana featuring Zhavia Ward) for the Deadpool 2 soundtrack. His second studio album, Harverd Dropout (2019) peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 and was panned by critics. His third studio album, Lil Pump 2 (2023) was released to generally favorable reviews despite failing to chart in any known territory.
