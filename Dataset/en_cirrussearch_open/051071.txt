The Buzău river (Romanian pronunciation: [buˈzəw]) in eastern Romania is a tributary of the river Siret. Its total length is 302 km, and its drainage basin area is 5,264 km2. Its source is in the south-eastern Carpathian Mountains, east of Brașov. The Buzău flows through the Romanian counties Brașov, Covasna, Buzău and Brăila. It flows into the Siret in Voinești, close to its confluence with the Danube, west of Galați. The river Buzău gives its name to two urban municipalities: the city of Buzău (the Buzău county seat) and the town of Întorsura Buzăului, in Covasna County. Întorsura Buzăului (which means Buzău's Turning in Romanian) gets its name from being located near a large turn that the river takes. It initially flows northwards, but takes a sudden turn towards the south-east near the town.
