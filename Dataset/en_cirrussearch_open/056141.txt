Qilakitsoq Qilakitsoq is an abandoned settlement and an important archaeological site in Greenland. It became known as the discovery location of eight mummified corpses from the Thule period. The Inuit mummies of Qilakitsoq offer important insights into the lives of Inuit about 500Â years ago. Qilakitsoq is located in West Greenland near the city of Uummannaq on the northern coast of the Nuussuaq peninsula (Greenlandic: Big Cape) in a sheltered cover of the Karrat Fjord. The Greenlandic name means "that which has very little sky," which probably refers to the steep cliffs which surround the area as well as its frequently occurring fog.
