Vasily I Dmitriyevich (Russian: Василий I Дмитриевич; 30 December 1371 – 27 February 1425) was Grand Prince of Vladimir and Moscow from 1389. He was the heir of Dmitry Donskoy, who reigned from 1359 to 1389. He entered an alliance with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1392 and married Sophia, the only daughter of Vytautas, though the alliance turned out to be fragile, and they waged war against each other in 1406–1408. The raid on the Volga region in 1395 by the Turco-Mongol emir Timur resulted in a state of anarchy for the Golden Horde and the independence of Moscow. In 1412, Vasily resumed submission to the Horde.
