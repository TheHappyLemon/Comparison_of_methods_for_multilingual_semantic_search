Under the Sun (Russian: В лучах солнца, romanized: V luchakh solntsa; Korean: 태양 아래, romanized: Taeyang Alae) is a 2015 Russian documentary film directed by Vitaly Mansky. It depicts a year in the life of a family in Pyongyang, North Korea, as their daughter, Zin-mi, prepares to join the Korean Children's Union on the Day of the Shining Star (Kim Jong-il's birthday). North Korea permitted only Mansky, cinematographer Alexandra Ivanova, and a sound assistant to visit the country. After discovering that the crew had smuggled unapproved footage out of the country and included it in the finished film, North Korean authorities objected to the film's screening. Under the Sun received mostly positive reviews from critics.
