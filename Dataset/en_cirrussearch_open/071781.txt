The White Army (Russian: Бѣлая армія/Белая армия, romanized: Belaya armiya) or White Guard (Бѣлая гвардія/Белая гвардия, Belaya gvardiya), also referred to as the Whites or White Guardsmen (бѣлогвардейцы/белогвардейцы, belogvardeytsi), was a common collective name for the armed formations of the White movement and anti-Bolshevik governments during the Russian Civil War. They fought against the Red Army of Soviet Russia. When it was created, the structure of the Russian Army of the Provisional Government period was used, while almost every individual formation had its own characteristics. The military art of the White Army was based on the experience of the First World War, which, however, left a strong imprint on the specifics of the Russian Civil War.
