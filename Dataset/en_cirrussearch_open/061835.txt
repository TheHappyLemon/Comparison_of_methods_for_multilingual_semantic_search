In the Russian Federation, a city of federal importance (Russian: город федерального значения, romanized: gorod federalnogo znacheniya), also known as a federal city, is a city that has a status of both an inhabited locality and a constituent federal subject. Russia claims three federal cities: Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Sevastopol, which was annexed in 2014 and remains internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. Moscow and Saint Petersburg are the largest cities in the country: Moscow is the national capital and Saint Petersburg is a former Russian capital and an important port city by the Baltic Sea. Currently, Sevastopol houses the Sevastopol Naval Base, the main port of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.
