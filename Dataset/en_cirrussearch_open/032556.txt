In geometry, a disk (also spelled disc) is the region in a plane bounded by a circle. A disk is said to be closed if it contains the circle that constitutes its boundary, and open if it does not. For a radius, r{\displaystyle r}, an open disk is usually denoted as Dr{\displaystyle D_{r}} and a closed disk is Dr¯{\displaystyle {\overline {D_{r}}}}. However in the field of topology the closed disk is usually denoted as D2{\displaystyle D^{2}} while the open disk is Int⁡D2{\displaystyle \operatorname {Int} D^{2}}.
