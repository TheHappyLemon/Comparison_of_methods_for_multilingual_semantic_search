Flattr was a Swedish-based microdonation subscription service, where subscribers opted in to pay a monthly patronage to help fund their favourite websites and creators. It shut down in November 2023. Flattr subscribers installed an open-source browser extension that records which websites they frequent and shares this data with Flattr. Flattr processes this user data and pays out shares of the user's subscription to each registered Flattr creator based on which websites the user consumed. Flattr filtered websites by domains with a default allowlist of participating domains, but individual users could override and contribute to any website they want or withhold contributions from any website.
