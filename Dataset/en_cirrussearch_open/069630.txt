Santa Rosa, officially the City of Santa Rosa (Filipino: Lungsod ng Santa Rosa), is a 1st class component city in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, its population was 414,812 people. It is the second largest local government unit in Laguna after Calamba. On August 28, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11395, which separated the city from the province's first district and granted the city its own congressional district to elect a representative in 2022. However, for the purposes of electing Sangguniang Panlalawigan members, Santa Rosa remains part of the province's first Sangguniang Panlalawigan District. Santa Rosa was initially known for the Coca-Cola and Toyota manufacturing plants in its industrial estates. It later became popular as the site of local theme park Enchanted Kingdom and several housing and commercial developments.
