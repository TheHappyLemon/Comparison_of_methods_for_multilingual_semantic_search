The Philippines women's national football team represents the Philippines in international women's association football competitions. It is managed by the Philippine Football Federation (PFF), the sport's governing body in the country. The Philippine women's national football team was established in the 1980s and has been a regular participant in the AFC Women's Asian Cup since their first appearance in 1981, back when the tournament was known as the AFC Women's Championship. The Philippines hosted the tournament in 1999, with matches played in Iloilo and Bacolod. The team took a hiatus from the continental tournament after competing in 2003. Following the AFC's introduction of a qualification process from the 2006 edition, the Philippines successfully returned to the AFC Women's Asian Cup in 2018, having qualified the previous year, and achieved a historic milestone by advancing beyond the group stage for the first time. Their success continued into the 2022 edition, where they reached the semifinals and secured their qualification for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. This marked the national team's debut at a FIFA Women's World Cup. In Southeast Asian football, the Philippine women's team won their first AFF Women's Championship title in 2022. Before this victory, the team had achieved limited success in previous editions of the championship and the Southeast Asian Games. Their notable accomplishments included bronze medal finishes in 1985—a year when only three teams competed in the women's football event—and in 2021. From December 2023 to March 2024, the team achieved their highest-ever position, 38th, in the FIFA Women's World Ranking.
