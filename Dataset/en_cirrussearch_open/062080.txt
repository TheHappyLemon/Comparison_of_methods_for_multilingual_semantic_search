Mtskheta-Mtianeti (Georgian: მცხეთა-მთიანეთი, literally "Mtskheta-Mountain Area") is a region (Mkhare) in eastern Georgia comprising the town of Mtskheta, which serves as a regional capital, together with its district and the adjoining mountainous areas. The western part of the region, namely the entire Akhalgori Municipality, is controlled by breakaway South Ossetia since the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.
