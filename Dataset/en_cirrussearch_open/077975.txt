Estonia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 with the song "Partners in Crime" written by Berit Veiber and Hendrik Sal-Saller. The song was performed by Gerli Padar. The Estonian broadcaster Eesti Televisioon (ETV) organised the national final Eurolaul 2007 in order to select the Estonian entry for the 2007 contest in Helsinki, Finland. Ten songs competed in the national final and the winner was selected over two rounds of public voting. In the first round, the top three were selected to qualify to the superfinal. In the superfinal, "Partners in Crime" performed by Gerli Padar was selected as the winner. Estonia competed in the semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 10 May 2007. Performing during the show in position 23, "Partners in Crime" was not announced among the top 10 entries of the semi-final and therefore did not qualify to compete in the final. It was later revealed that Estonia placed twenty-second out of the 27 participating countries in the semi-final with 33 points.
