Leskov Island is an island in the South Sandwich Islands named after Russian sailor Arcady Leskov. It is a semicircular 190 metres (620 ft) high eroded volcano with a large bay on its eastern side. Leskov Island is almost entirely surrounded by cliffs and has a surface area of 0.55 by 0.93 kilometres (0.34 mi × 0.58 mi). Volcanic rocks form tuffs and lava and consist almost entirely of andesite. There are no known historical eruptions, but there is widespread fumarolic activity which has varied over time. Mosses and liverworts grow next to the fumaroles, but this vegetation also occurs away from the vents. Several seabirds have been observed nesting on the island.
