The Nokia 9000 Communicator was the first product in Nokia's Communicator series, announced at CeBIT 1996 and introduced into the market on 15 August 1996. The phone weighed 397 grams (14.0 oz), was powered by an Intel 24 MHz i386 CPU, and had 8 MB of memory. The memory was divided between applications (4 MB), program memory (2 MB) and user data (2 MB). The operating system was PEN/GEOS 3.0. The Communicator was one of the earliest smartphones on the market, after the IBM Simon in 1994 and the HP OmniGo 700LX, a DOS-based palmtop PC with integrated cradle for the Nokia 2110 cellular mobile phone, announced in late 1995 and shipped in March 1996. The Communicator was highly advanced, featuring sending and receiving e-mail and fax via its 9.6 kbit/s GSM modem, and it also had a web browser and business programs. It was formed of a clamshell design that opened up to reveal a monochrome LCD display with a 640 × 200 resolution and a full QWERTY keyboard similar to a Psion PDA. It was priced £1,000 in the UK upon launch (equivalent to £2,000 in 2021). Then-CEO of Nokia, Jorma Ollila, said in 2012 regarding the device: "We were five years ahead."
