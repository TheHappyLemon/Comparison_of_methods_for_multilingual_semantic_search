Karbala or Kerbala (/ˈkɑːrbələ/ KAR-bə-lə, US also /ˌkɑːrbəˈlɑː/ KAR-bə-LAH; Arabic: كَرْبَلَاء, romanized: Karbalāʾ, IPA: [karbaˈlaːʔ]) is a city in central Iraq, located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Baghdad, and a few miles east of Lake Milh, also known as Razzaza Lake. Karbala is the capital of Karbala Governorate, and has an estimated population of 711,530 people (2018). The city, best known as the location of the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, or for the shrines of Hussain and Al Abbas, is considered a holy city for Shia Muslims. Tens of millions of Shi'ite Muslims visit the site twice a year. The martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali and Abbas ibn Ali is commemorated annually by millions of Shi'ites. Up to 34 million pilgrims visit the city to observe ʿĀshūrāʾ (the tenth day of the month of Muharram), which marks the anniversary of Husayn's death, but the main event is the Arbaʿīn (the 40th day after 'Ashura'), where up to 40 million visit the graves. Most of the pilgrims travel on foot from all around Iraq and more than 56 countries.
