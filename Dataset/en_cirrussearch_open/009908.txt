HAT-P-7b (or Kepler-2b) is an extrasolar planet discovered in 2008. It orbits very close to its host star and is larger and more massive than Jupiter. Due to the extreme heat that it receives from its star, the dayside temperature is predicted to be 2,630–2,880 K (4,270–4,720 °F; 2,360–2,610 °C) K, while nightside temperatures are 2,211–2,238 K (3,520–3,569 °F; 1,938–1,965 °C). HAT-P-7b is also one of the darkest planets ever observed, with an albedo of less than 0.03—meaning it absorbs more than 97% of the visible light that strikes it.
