Jurassic World Dominion is a 2022 American science fiction action film directed by Colin Trevorrow, who co-wrote the screenplay with Emily Carmichael from a story by Derek Connolly and Trevorrow. It is the sequel to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), the third and final installment in the Jurassic World trilogy, and the sixth installment overall in the Jurassic Park film series, concluding the storyline that began with Jurassic Park (1993). Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, BD Wong, and Omar Sy reprise their roles from the previous films, along with Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Sam Neill, who appear together for the first time since the original Jurassic Park. New cast members include DeWanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie. The film is set four years after the events of Fallen Kingdom, with dinosaurs now living alongside humans around the world. It follows Owen Grady and Claire Dearing as they embark on a rescue mission, while Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, and Ian Malcolm work to expose a conspiracy by the genomics corporation Biosyn. Planning for the film began in 2014, before the release of the first Jurassic World film. Filming took place from February to November 2020 in Vancouver, Canada, England's Pinewood Studios, Malta and Switzerland. Legendary Pictures was not involved in the film's production due to the expiration of its four-year partnership with Universal. With an estimated budget of $265 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made. Jurassic World Dominion premiered in Mexico City on May 23, 2022, and was released in the United States by Universal Pictures on June 10, 2022. It received generally negative reviews from critics. However, like its predecessors, the film was a financial success and grossed over $1 billion worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2022. Jurassic World Dominion was also the third film released in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic to reach the $1 billion milestone. A seventh film is in development.
