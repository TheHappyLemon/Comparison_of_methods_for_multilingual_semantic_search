St Paul's Island (Maltese: Il-GÅ¼ejjer ta' San Pawl), also known as Selmunett, is a small island off Selmun near the north-east of the main island of Malta. St Paul's Island is sometimes split into two islands by a shallow isthmus, and it is therefore sometimes referred to in the plural as St Paul's Islands. St Paul's Island has been uninhabited since World War II, and it is the second largest uninhabited island of Malta, having an area of 0.1 square kilometres (0.04 square miles).
