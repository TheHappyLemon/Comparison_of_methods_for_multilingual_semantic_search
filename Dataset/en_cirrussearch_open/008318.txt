The 1990 FIBA World Championship was the 11th FIBA World Championship, the international basketball world championship for men's national teams. It was hosted by Argentina from 8 to 19 August 1990. The final phase of the competition was held at the Luna Park, Buenos Aires. Yugoslavia emerged as the tournament winner. This was the last World Championship in which the country participated before its dissolution. Likewise, the Soviet Union participated in its final tournament before its dissolution. This was the first ever FIBA World Championship (now called FIBA Basketball World Cup) tournament, in which non-American current NBA players that had also already played in an official regular season NBA game could participate.
