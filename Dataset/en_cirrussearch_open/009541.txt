In mathematics, a Hermitian matrix (or self-adjoint matrix) is a complex square matrix that is equal to its own conjugate transpose—that is, the element in the i-th row and j-th column is equal to the complex conjugate of the element in the j-th row and i-th column, for all indices i and j: A Hermitian⟺aij=aji¯{\displaystyle A{\text{ Hermitian}}\quad \iff \quad a_{ij}={\overline {{a}_{ji}}}} or in matrix form: A Hermitian⟺A=AT¯.{\displaystyle A{\text{ Hermitian}}\quad \iff \quad A={\overline {A^{\mathsf {T}}}}.} Hermitian matrices can be understood as the complex extension of real symmetric matrices. If the conjugate transpose of a matrix A{\displaystyle A} is denoted by AH,{\displaystyle A^{\mathsf {H}},} then the Hermitian property can be written concisely as A Hermitian⟺A=AH{\displaystyle A{\text{ Hermitian}}\quad \iff \quad A=A^{\mathsf {H}}} Hermitian matrices are named after Charles Hermite, who demonstrated in 1855 that matrices of this form share a property with real symmetric matrices of always having real eigenvalues. Other, equivalent notations in common use are AH=A†=A∗,{\displaystyle A^{\mathsf {H}}=A^{\dagger }=A^{\ast },} although in quantum mechanics, A∗{\displaystyle A^{\ast }} typically means the complex conjugate only, and not the conjugate transpose.
