The 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 ING Magyar Nagydíj 2009) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 July 2009 at the Hungaroring in Mogyoród, 18 km (11 mi) north of Budapest, Hungary. It was the tenth race of the 2009 FIA Formula One World Championship. The 70-lap race was won by 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton for McLaren-Mercedes, after starting from fourth place on the grid. The 2007 world champion Kimi Räikkönen finished second for Ferrari, with Red Bull Racing's Mark Webber finishing third. Championship leader Jenson Button had a poor race to finish seventh, losing ground to Webber in the championship. Hamilton's win was his first since the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix, which was also the last time he had appeared on the podium. The result also marked the first time that a car equipped with a regenerative brake system (KERS) had won a race. Räikkönen's second place was Ferrari's best result of the season so far, but his teammate Felipe Massa suffered a serious accident during the second part of the Saturday afternoon qualifying session which left him with a fractured skull. The race also saw the debut of World Series by Renault racer and 2008 British Formula Three champion Jaime Alguersuari, who became the youngest Formula One driver in the championship's 59-year history, at the age of 19 years and 125 days, and the first to be born in the 1990s. However, Alguersuari's record has been broken since Max Verstappen debuted in 2015. He replaced the fired Sébastien Bourdais at Scuderia Toro Rosso.
