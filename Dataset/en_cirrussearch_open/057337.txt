Florin Vasile Cîțu (Romanian pronunciation: [floˈrin vaˈsile ˈkɨt͡su]; born 1 April 1972) is a Romanian politician who served as Prime Minister of Romania between December 2020 and November 2021 (acting/ad interim between October and November 2021). Sometimes labeled as Romania's first libertarian Prime Minister, he was also the leader of the National Liberal Party (PNL) between September 2021 and April 2022. After a motion of no-confidence ended his premiership, Cîțu was voted President of the Senate of Romania by the new PSD-PNL-UDMR/RMDSZ CNR coalition established in the Parliament, after the fall of the government he headed in late 2021. However, he resigned from this office also in June 2022, after the same coalition withdrew its support for him. Previously, he also served as Minister of Public Finance in both the first and second cabinet of former PNL Prime Minister Ludovic Orban between 2019 and 2020.
