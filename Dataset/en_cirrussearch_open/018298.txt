The Dallas Grand Prix was a round of the Formula One World Championship held in Dallas in 1984. The race was cancelled in 1985 due to financial problems and safety concerns. The Dallas Grand Prix became a round of the Trans-Am Series in 1988. The initial Dallas races were held on a street circuit in Fair Park, which generated noise and inconvenience for the numerous nearby homeowners, prompting organizers to seek a less noise-sensitive venue. They decided on Addison Airport, located in a largely industrial area in the nearby town of Addison. The 1989 event was held on May 12–14 on a new temporary 2.53 km (1.57 mi) circuit built partially on public streets and partially on taxiways and the south end of the runway. Although it benefited Addison hotels and restaurants, the race disrupted operations at the busy airfield for weeks, prompting airport businesses and the airport management company to lodge complaints with the town and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 1990. After the 1991 race, the FAA, the town, the race organizers, and airport managers and tenants agreed that 1992 would be the last year the race would be held at the airport. The agreement became moot when the race organizers, who had lost money on the previous events, cancelled the 1992 race citing financial reasons. In 1993, the race relocated to a temporary street circuit around the Reunion Arena, at the time home to many of Dallas's sports teams.
