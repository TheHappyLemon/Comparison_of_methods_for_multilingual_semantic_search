The Cher (French pronunciation: [ʃɛʁ] ; Occitan: Char) is a river in central France, a left tributary of the Loire. It is 365.1 km (226.9 mi) long, and its basin area is 13,718 km2 (5,297 sq mi). Its source is in the Creuse department, north-east of Crocq. It joins the river Loire at Villandry, west of Tours. The river suffered a devastating flood in 1940, which damaged the Château de Chenonceau, which spans the river, and other structures along the banks. It owes its name to the pre-Indo-European root kʰar 'stone'.
