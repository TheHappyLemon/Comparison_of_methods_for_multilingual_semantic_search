Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Kokorin (né Kartashov; Russian: Алекса́ндр Алекса́ндрович Коко́рин, pronounced [ɐlʲɪˈksandr ɐlʲɪˈksandrəvʲɪtɕ kɐˈkorʲɪn]; born 19 March 1991) is a Russian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Cypriot club Aris Limassol on loan from Italian side Fiorentina. Kokorin had his breakthrough season in 2012–13, which led to Dynamo Moscow inserting a €19 million release clause into his contract. A full international since 2011, Kokorin has gained over 45 caps and was named in the Russian squads for Euro 2012, 2014 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2016. In October 2018, he was arrested on an assault-related charge. He was later found guilty and spent approximately one year in prison.
