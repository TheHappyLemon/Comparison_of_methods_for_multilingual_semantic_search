Aloe vera (/ˈæloʊ(i) vɛrə, vɪər-/) is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe. It is widely distributed, and is considered an invasive species in many world regions. An evergreen perennial, it originates from the Arabian Peninsula, but also grows wild in tropical, semi-tropical, and arid climates around the world. It is cultivated for commercial products, mainly as a topical treatment used over centuries. The species is attractive for decorative purposes, and succeeds indoors as a potted plant. The leaves of Aloe vera contain significant amounts of the polysaccharide gel acemannan, which can be used for topical purposes. Aloe skin contains aloin which is toxic. Products made from Aloe vera usually only use the gel. There are many products containing aloe vera's acemannan, including skin lotions, cosmetics, ointments and gels for minor burns, skin abrasions, insect bites, and windburn. Oral ingestion of aloe vera extracts can be dangerous, because it causes reactions which are not yet fully understood. It is especially dangerous for pregnant women. Some people have allergic reactions, even when the aloe vera is applied only to the skin.
