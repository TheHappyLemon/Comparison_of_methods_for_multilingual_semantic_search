The 1985–86 European Cup was the 31st season of UEFA's premier club football tournament, the European Cup. The European Champion Clubs' Cup was won by Steaua București on penalties in the final against Barcelona. Steaua București became the first Eastern Bloc side to win the tournament. The final was decided mainly by goalkeeper Helmuth Duckadam, who (after keeping a clean sheet in the final) saved all four of Barcelona's penalties to secure the cup. Juventus, the defending champions, were eliminated by Barcelona in the quarter-finals. No clubs from England were entered into the competition during this year, owing to a ban from European competition in light of the Heysel Stadium disaster. Had the ban not been imposed, Everton would have represented England.
