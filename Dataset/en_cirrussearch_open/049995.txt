Mahmoud Ahmed Ibrahim Hassan (Arabic: مَحمُود أَحمَد إبرَاهِيْم حَسَن; born 1 October 1994), commonly known as Trézéguet, is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Süper Lig club Trabzonspor and the Egypt national team. His nickname is taken from the French former footballer David Trezeguet, after his former youth coach noticed similarities between the pair in playing style and appearance. He began his career with Al Ahly, breaking into the first team at the age of 18 and helping them win the 2012 CAF Champions League and 2013 CAF Champions League. In 2015, he joined Belgian team Anderlecht and the move was later made permanent. However, he struggled to establish himself in the first team and spent the following two seasons on loan, first with fellow Belgian side Mouscron and later Turkish side Kasımpaşa. With Kasımpaşa, he became the highest scoring Egyptian player in the Turkish top flight in a single season which prompted the club to make the transfer permanent in 2018. Having represented Egypt at under-20 and under-23 level, Trézéguet made his full debut for the Egyptian senior side in 2014 at the age of 19 in a friendly against Kenya. He was named in Egypt's squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, playing in all three group matches. To date, he has made over 70 appearances for his country's national team, scoring 16 goals.
