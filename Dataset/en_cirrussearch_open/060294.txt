Scrophularia umbrosa, the green figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant found in Europe and Asia. It grows in moist and cultivated waste ground. The species looks very similar to the closely related Scrophularia auriculata (water figwort). Green figwort has a greener stem than water figwort, and lacks the leaf auricles which give water figwort its Latin name. The plant is probably poisonous to cows. It is pollinated by bees and wasps. It can grow in semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade, but requires moist or wet soil.
