The Fersen family, stylized as the von Fersen (German: Versen), is a Baltic-German noble family grouped into several ennobled branches that settled in and around the kingdoms bordering the Baltic Sea in Northern Europe. The most well-known holders of the surname settled in modern day Sweden and Livonia (modern day Latvia and Estonia) which was once part of the Swedish Empire, and later of the Russian Empire.
