"Does Your Mother Know" is a song by Swedish pop group ABBA and was the second single taken from their sixth album, Voulez-Vous. The B-side was "Kisses of Fire", which was also taken from the album. The song is notable for its emphasis on male vocals, performed by Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus, with female backing vocals. "Does Your Mother Know" was recorded in February 1979 and released as a single in April of that year. Written by Benny Andersson and Ulvaeus, the demo for "Does Your Mother Know" featured Ulvaeus on guide vocal and it was decided to keep this during the recording process. The track was debuted on the Eurovision networked BBC TV Special ABBA In Switzerland broadcast across the continent in April 1979 when the group performed a slightly different version of the track partially live during the show, with a much longer instrumental introduction from the recorded version. In 2019, the single was re-released on picture disc.
