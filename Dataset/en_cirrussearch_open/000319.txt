Latvia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 with the song "What For?" written by Jānis Lūsēns and Guntars Račs. The song was performed by Aisha. The Latvian broadcaster Latvijas Televīzija (LTV) organised the national final Eirodziesma 2010 in order to select the Latvian entry for the 2010 contest in Oslo, Norway. Ten songs were selected to compete in the national final on 27 February 2010 where two rounds of voting by a public televote and a five-member jury panel selected "What For?" performed by Aisha as the winner. Latvia was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 25 May 2010. Performing during for the show in position 6, "What For?" was not announced among the top 10 entries of the first semi-final and therefore did not qualify to compete in the final. It was later revealed that Latvia placed seventeenth (last) out of the 17 participating countries in the semi-final with 11 points.
