The Sorbian Institute (German: Sorbisches Institut; Sorbian: Serbski institut, Upper Sorbian: [ˈsɛʁpskʲi instʲiˈtut] , Lower Sorbian: [ˈsɛrpskʲi instʲiˈtut]) is a research facility focused on Sorbian languages, culture and history. It is an extra-university institute collecting and archiving Sorbian texts and cultural artifacts making them available to the public. Originally founded as Institute for Sorbian Ethnology (Institut für sorbische Volksforschung; Institut za serbski ludospyt) by Pawoł Nowotny in 1951, it was then integrated into the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin in 1952. In 1992, the Sorbian institute was established by a treaty of the two German states Brandenburg and Saxony.
