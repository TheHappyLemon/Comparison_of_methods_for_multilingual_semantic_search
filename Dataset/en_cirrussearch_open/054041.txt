The 2020 Il Lombardia was a one-day road cycling race that took place on 15 August 2020 in the Italian region of Lombardy. It was part of the 2020 UCI World Tour and was the 114th edition of Il Lombardia. The race was initially scheduled to take place on 10 October. The race was first rescheduled to 31 October with the May calendar update, and subsequently to 15 August with the June calendar update due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With around 50 kilometres to go, a select group, including defending champion Bauke Mollema and 2015 and 2017 winner Vincenzo Nibali, both of Trek–Segafredo, broke away from the peloton. On the descent of the Muro di Sormano, Belgian rider Remco Evenepoel of Deceuninck–Quick-Step crashed into a low wall on a bridge, somersaulting over it and into the ravine below. He suffered a fractured pelvis and a right lung contusion and had to abandon the race. Despite having three riders in the leading group of six, none of Trek–Segafredo's riders could keep up as Jakob Fuglsang of Astana accelerated away on the Civiglio climb, taking with him his Russian teammate Aleksandr Vlasov as well as New Zealander George Bennett of Team Jumbo–Visma. On the final climb, the San Fermo della Battaglia, Bennett put in several attacks that managed to shed Vlasov, but Fuglsang put in the winning move moments later and in turn dropped Bennett. Fuglsang soloed to victory and, in doing so, became the first Danish winner of the race. After Fuglsang had won, German rider Maximilian Schachmann of Bora–Hansgrohe was still several kilometres away from finishing, when he was side-swiped by an errant non-race car that drove across the road and his path, causing him to fall and become visibly upset and angry at race officials. As a result of the crash, Schachmann fractured his collarbone.
