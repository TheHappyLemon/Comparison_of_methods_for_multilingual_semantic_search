The 2014 Singapore Grand Prix (formally the 2014 Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 21 September at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay, Singapore. It was the 14th round of the 2014 Formula One World Championship and the 7th Singapore Grand Prix held as part of the series. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won the 60-lap race from pole position. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo were second and third. It was Hamilton's seventh victory of the season and the 29th of his career. Hamilton won the pole position by posting the fastest lap time in qualifying and maintained the lead into the first corner. His teammate Nico Rosberg had a wiring loom steering problem and began from the pit lane. Hamilton remained in the lead after the first round of pit stops before ceding it to Ricciardo for one lap in the second pit stop phase. In the final laps, Hamilton made his final pit stop to switch tyres and rejoined just ahead of Ricciardo. Vettel led for one lap until Hamilton passed him on lap 54 to win. There were four lead changes among three different drivers during the course of the race. The result returned Hamilton to the lead of the World Drivers' Championship with 241 points, three ahead of teammate Rosberg who retired after 14 laps after his problem could not be rectified. Ricciardo maintained third place, with Fernando Alonso and Vettel passing the non-scoring Valtteri Bottas to move into fourth and fifth. Mercedes further extended their lead in the Constructors' Championship to 182 points over Red Bull in second. Williams and Ferrari maintained third and fourth and Force India overtook McLaren for fifth with five races left in the season.
