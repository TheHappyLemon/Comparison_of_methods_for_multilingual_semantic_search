Brčko District (Serbo-Croatian: Brčko Distrikt / Брчко Дистрикт), officially the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Serbo-Croatian: Brčko Distrikt Bosne i Hercegovine / Брчко Дистрикт Босне и Херцеговине), is a self-governing administrative unit in north-eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Officially a condominium of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, it was formed in 1999 to reflect the multi-ethnic nature of Brčko and the surrounding areas and their special status within the newly independent Bosnia and Herzegovina. In reality, it functions as a local self-government area, much like the other municipalities in the country. The seat of the district is the city of Brčko.
