The 2023 AFC Asian Cup was the 18th edition of the AFC Asian Cup, the quadrennial international football tournament organised by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). It involved 24 national teams after its expansion in 2019, with the host Qatar the defending champions. On 17 October 2022, the AFC announced that the tournament would be held in Qatar, replacing the original host China. Due to the high summer temperatures and Qatar's participation in the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup, the tournament was postponed to 12 January – 10 February 2024, while retaining the original name for both existing sponsorship and logistical purposes. Hosts and defending champions Qatar successfully retained their title, defeating Jordan 3–1 in the final.
