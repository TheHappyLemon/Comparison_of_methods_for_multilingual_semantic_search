The kinetic theory of gases is a simple classical model of the thermodynamic behavior of gases. It treats a gas as composed of numerous particles, too small to see with a microscope, which are constantly in random motion. Their collisions with each other and with the walls of their container are used to explain physical properties of the gasâ€”for example the relationship between its temperature, pressure and volume. The particles are now known to be the atoms or molecules of the gas. The basic version of the model describes an ideal gas. It treats the collisions as perfectly elastic and as the only interaction between the particles, which are additionally assumed to be much smaller than their average distance apart. The theory's introduction allowed many principal concepts of thermodynamics to be established. It explains the macroscopic properties of gases, such as volume, pressure, and temperature, as well as transport properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity and mass diffusivity. Due to the time reversibility of microscopic dynamics (microscopic reversibility), the kinetic theory is also connected to the principle of detailed balance, in terms of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (for Brownian motion) and the Onsager reciprocal relations. The theory was historically significant as the first explicit exercise of the ideas of statistical mechanics.
