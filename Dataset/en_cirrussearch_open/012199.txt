The Hungarian men's national ice hockey team is the national ice hockey team of Hungary. They have participated in the IIHF European Championships, the IIHF World Hockey Championships and the Olympic Games since 1928. A consistent participant of the annual World Championship, Hungary has played at the Olympics three times, most recently in 1964. They are currently ranked 19th in the world by the IIHF. The team is controlled by the Hungarian Ice Hockey Federation (Magyar Jégkorong Szövetség). No Hungarian-born players have ever played in North America's National Hockey League; however, three have been selected in the NHL Entry Draft: Tamás Gröschl by the Edmonton Oilers (1999), Levente Szuper by the Calgary Flames (2000), and János Vas by the Dallas Stars (2002).
