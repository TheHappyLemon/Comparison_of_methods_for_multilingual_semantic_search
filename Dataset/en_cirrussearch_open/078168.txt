"Feuer frei!" (German pronunciation: [ˈfɔʏɐ ˈfʁaɪ]) is a song by German industrial metal band Rammstein. The song was released as the fifth single from their third album Mutter. The title is from the command to start shooting in German military language (literally "fire freely!") and can be compared to "fire at will" or "open fire". "Feuer frei!" is one of the band's most well known songs. Despite this, it does not feature on the band's greatest hits collection Made in Germany 1995–2011, for reasons that have not been explained. The song is featured in the film xXx and during the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode "Slaves of Las Vegas". The UK "Feuer frei!" single was released in three parts (2 CDs, 1 DVD), in three different colors (Yellow-Green-Orange), each with different track listings.
