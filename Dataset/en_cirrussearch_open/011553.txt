.nf is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Norfolk Island. While there is no rule requiring a local presence to register domains in this TLD, the pricing is significantly higher than most other domains, which has discouraged its use. Although registrations at the second level are the most expensive, they are still more common than third-level registrations, and most names in use are for sites relating to Norfolk Island. .nf is a member of CoCCA, a group of country-code domains making use of common registry and/or dispute resolution services.
