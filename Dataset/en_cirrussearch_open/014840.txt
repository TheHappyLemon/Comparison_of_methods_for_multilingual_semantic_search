The Benelux Tour (previously known as the Eneco Tour and the BinckBank Tour) is a road bicycle racing stage-race that is part of the UCI World Tour. The race was established in 2005 and was originally known as the Eneco Tour, named after the original sponsor. In 2017, the online discount broker BinckBank took over as the title sponsor, with the name of the race changing accordingly. In 2021, with the absence of a title sponsor, the race was known again as the Benelux Tour. The race was not held in 2022 due to conflicts with the racing calendar. In 2023, waste management company Renewi joined as a sponsor and renamed the race once again, this time to the Renewi Tour.
