The Mongolian People's Republic (MPR; Mongolian: Бүгд Найрамдах Монгол Ард Улс, БНМАУ, Bügd Nairamdakh Mongol Ard Uls) was a socialist state that existed from 1924 to 1992, located in the historical region of Outer Mongolia in East Asia. It was officially recognized by the Nationalist government as independent from the Republic of China in 1946. Until 1990, it was a one-party state ruled by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and maintained close political and economic ties with the Soviet Union, as part of the Eastern Bloc. Outer Mongolia gained independence from Qing China in 1911, and enjoyed brief autonomy before it was seized by the Republic of China in 1919. After a Soviet-backed revolution in 1921, the Mongolian People's Republic was established in 1924. It was led from 1939 to 1952 by Khorloogiin Choibalsan, who carried out Stalinist purges in the country, and from 1952 to 1984 by Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, who allied with the Soviets during the 1960s Sino-Soviet split. In 1990, protests for democracy resulted in reforms which established a multi-party system and a market economy, and a new constitution in 1992 ended the socialist republic.
