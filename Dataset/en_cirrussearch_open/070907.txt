Nepotism is the act of granting an advantage, privilege, or position to relatives or friends in an occupation or field. These fields may include but are not limited to: business, politics, academia, entertainment, sports, religion, and health care. The term originated with the assignment of nephews to important positions by Catholic popes and bishops. Nepotism has been criticized since ancient history by several philosophers, including Aristotle, Valluvar, and Confucius, condemning it as both evil and unwise.
