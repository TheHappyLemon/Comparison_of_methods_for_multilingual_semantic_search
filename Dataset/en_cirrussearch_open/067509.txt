The National Police of Ukraine (Ukrainian: Націона́льна полі́ція Украї́ни, romanized: Natsionálʹna polítsiya Ukrayíny, IPA: [nɐt͡s⁽ʲ⁾ioˈnɑlʲnɐ poˈl⁽ʲ⁾it͡s⁽ʲ⁾ijɐ ʊkrɐˈjinɪ]; abbr. НПУ, NPU), often simply referred to as the Politsiia (Поліція, 'Police'), is the national, and only, police service of Ukraine. It was formed on 3 July 2015, as part of the post-Euromaidan reforms launched by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, to replace Ukraine's previous national police service, the Militsiya. On 7 November 2015, all the remaining militsiya were labelled "temporary acting" members of the National Police. The agency is overseen by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
