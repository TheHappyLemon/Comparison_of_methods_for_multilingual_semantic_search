"Pac's Life" is a single written and performed by American rappers Tupac Shakur and T.I and R&B singer Ashanti, produced by L. T. Hutton for Shakur's posthumously released album of the same name. It is a hip hop and R&B song; the second Tupac verse was recycled from a song titled "This Life I Lead". T.I. said in an interview that working on the song was an honor, as he idolized him while growing up. The single peaked at #1 on the Billboard Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles in the December 2, 2006 issue of Billboard magazine. It was also a top ten hit in Ireland and peaked at number 21 in the UK. On MTV Australia, "Pac's Life" peaked at the number 1 spot on the Hip Hop Countdown, beating new releases from Jay-Z, Eminem and 50 Cent, and Nas. The original version of the song samples Prince's "Pop Life" and is a minute and 34 seconds in duration, with some speculating it might have been cut off when it was initially leaked. It first features Tupac's verse and Tupac singing the hook.
