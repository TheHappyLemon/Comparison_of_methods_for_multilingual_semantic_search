Filago is a genus of plants in the sunflower family, native from Europe and northern Africa to Mongolia, Nepal, and Macaronesia. They are sometimes called cottonroses or cudweeds. The name cudweed comes from the fact that they were once used to feed cows that had lost the ability to chew the cud. Several species are sometimes treated as members of the genus Logfia.
