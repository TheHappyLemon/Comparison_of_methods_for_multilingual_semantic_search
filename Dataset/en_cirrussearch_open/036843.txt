He committed suicide shortly after his 31st birthday allegedly because he could not face an operation. Although many reference books refer to his death date as August 12, 1909, the Washington Post for that morning contained an August 11 dispatch of his death. The Trenton (N.J.) Evening Times of August 11, 1909, reported "The body of M. Swiderski, the noted chess player, who committed suicide on August 2 was found today in the room where he had poisoned himself and then fired a bullet into this head. The body was badly decomposed. The date of the suicide was determined by a note left by Swiderski. Swiderski was recently convicted of perjury in a trial that involved him in a disgraceful scandal." [2]
