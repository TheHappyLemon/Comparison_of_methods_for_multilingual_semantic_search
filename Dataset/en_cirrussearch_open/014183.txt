The Argentine Islands are a group of islands in the Wilhelm Archipelago of Antarctica, situated 9 km (5 nmi) southwest of Petermann Island, and 7 km (4 nmi) northwest of Cape Tuxen on Kyiv Peninsula in Graham Land. They were discovered by the French Antarctic Expedition, 1903–05, under Jean-Baptiste Charcot, and named by him for the Argentine Republic, in appreciation of that government's support of his expedition.
