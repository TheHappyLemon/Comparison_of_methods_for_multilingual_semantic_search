Robert Jarni (born 26 October 1968) is a Croatian former professional footballer who played as a left winger or wingback. Jarni started his professional career with Hajduk Split in 1986, and went on to spend 10 years playing for various clubs in Italy and Spain before finishing his career as a player in Greece with Panathinaikos in 2002. He was a regular in the Croatia national football team between 1990 and 2002, winning a total of 80 international caps for Croatia and being the national team's record cap holder until June 2006, when his record was beaten by Dario Šimić. Prior to Croatia's independence, he also won 7 international caps for the Yugoslavia. Jarni participated in three FIFA World Cup finals, in 1990 with Yugoslavia and in 1998 and 2002 with Croatia, making a total of 11 appearances in the competition. The crowning moment of his career was the 1998 World Cup in France, where he appeared in all of Croatia's 7 matches at the tournament and helped them win the bronze medals in their first World Cup appearance. He also scored his only international goal for Croatia during the tournament, netting the opening goal in their 3–0 win over Germany in the quarter-finals. During the last qualifying match of Euro 2000 where Croatia played FR Yugoslavia, Jarni collided with defender Zoran Mirković and insulted Mirković after he went down, only for Mirković to grab and twist Jarni's testicles, in which the referee sent him off and banned him for three matches, which made him miss FR Yugoslavia's Euro 2000 campaign. After his retirement from professional football as a player, he spent several seasons playing futsal, even winning two international caps for Croatia in the sport, and also started his managerial career with Hajduk Split in 2007.
