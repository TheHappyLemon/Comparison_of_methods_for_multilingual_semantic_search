The Kaliningrad question is a political question concerning the status of Kaliningrad Oblast as an exclave of Russia, and its isolation from the rest of the Baltic region following the 2004 enlargement of the European Union. In Western media, the region is often discussed in relation to the deployment of missile systems, initially as a response to the deployment of missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. Russia views the region as a vital element of its ability to project power in the Baltic region. One position calls for the independence of Kaliningrad, and is supported by political forces such as the fringe Baltic Republican Party, which has been banned from electoral participation by the Kremlin. In 2023, it claimed to have held an online referendum, with 72.1 per cent of participants voting for Kaliningrad Oblast to leave the Russian Federation. A fringe position also considers the return of the province to Germany from the Russian Federation. This question is mostly hypothetical, as the German government has stated that it has no claim to it and has formally renounced in international law any right to any lands east of the Oder by ratifying the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany.
