Kyle Terrell Lowry (born March 25, 1986) is an American professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A six-time All-Star, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team in 2016 and won an NBA championship with the Toronto Raptors in 2019, their first and only title in franchise history. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest Raptors players of all time due to his work with turning the franchise around, from the post-Vince Carter era to their first-ever championship in 2019. As starting point guard, Lowry played an integral role in the Raptors' success from 2012 to 2021. Lowry was also a member of the U.S. national team that won a gold medal in the 2016 Summer Olympics. Lowry played two seasons of college basketball with the Villanova Wildcats before he was selected by the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the 2006 NBA draft with the 24th overall pick. He appeared in three seasons with the Grizzlies before being traded to the Houston Rockets in February 2009. After spending four seasons in Houston, he was traded to Toronto during the 2012 off-season, forming a backcourt duo with DeMar DeRozan. In his second season with the Raptors, he helped them reach the playoffs for the first time in six years and win an Atlantic Division title during the 2013–14 season. In 2015–16, he led the Raptors to a then franchise-record of 56 wins, as well as helping the team make the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time. In 2021, Lowry was traded to the Miami Heat, where he helped the team reach the 2023 NBA Finals. In 2024, he was traded to the Charlotte Hornets, before joining the 76ers via a contract buyout.
