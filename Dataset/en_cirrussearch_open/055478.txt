Orlík Castle (Czech: Zámek Orlík) is a château 500 metres (1,600 ft) in Orlík nad Vltavou, in Písek District in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. The original position of the spur castle, on a rock 60 metres (200 ft) above the Vltava valley, was altered by the creation of the Orlík Reservoir in 1954–62, and the chateâu is now barely a few metres above the water level. The meaning of the name Orlík stems from the word "young eagle" (Czech: orel). It is often suggested that this castle would have resembled an eagle or nest perched upon the rocky outcrop above a turn in the river.
