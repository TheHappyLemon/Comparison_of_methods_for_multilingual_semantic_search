Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Cambodia have several levels. Cambodia is divided into 24 provinces (khaet; Khmer: ខេត្ត) and the special administrative unit and capital of Phnom Penh. Though a different administrative unit, Phnom Penh is at provincial level, so de facto Cambodia has 25 provinces and municipalities. Each province is divided into districts. As of 2023[update], there are 162 districts throughout the country's provinces, including Phnom Penh. Each province has one capital district (known as either a city or town, krong; ក្រុង), e.g. for Siem Reap, it is Krong Siem Reap. The exceptions are the provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Speu, Kandal, Koh Kong, Mondulkiri, Oddar Meanchey, Ratanakiri, Takéo and Tboung Khmum, where the name of the province and the capital district does not match. A provincial district (srok, ស្រុក) is divided into communes (khum, ឃុំ). Communes are further divided into villages (phum, ភូមិ). Phnom Penh's 14 districts are called khan (ខណ្ឌ) and their subdivisions sangkat (សង្កាត់), which are smaller in the other provinces. Sangkat are further subdivided into phum, which are usually translated as villages, though they do not necessarily cover one single settlement.
