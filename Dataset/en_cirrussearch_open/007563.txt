WTF?! is the sixteenth studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released on April 26, 2011, on KMFDM Records and Metropolis Records. The regular line-up of Sascha Konietzko, Lucia Cifarelli, Jules Hodgson, Andy Selway, and Steve White was joined by a handful of musicians from other industrial and alternative metal acts. The album took about twice as long as usual for the band to produce, and underwent a significant amount of modification during its recording. WTF?! reached No. 8 on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums chart. Its first single, "Krank", hit No. 15 on the Billboard Singles chart, while its second, "Amnesia", hit No. 3 on the Deutsche Alternative Charts. Critics were generally very positive about the album, and while some felt the album was relatively creative, most felt it stayed close to the same formula the band had used for years.
