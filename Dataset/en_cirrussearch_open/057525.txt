The Wojska Polskiego Avenue (literally Army of Poland Avenue; German before 1945: Falkenwalder Straße) is one of the main streets of the Polish city of Szczecin (length 6.9 km), running from the south-east to the north-west. It lies on the territory of eight municipal neighbourhoods: Centrum, Śródmieście-Zachód, Śródmieście-Północ, Łękno, Pogodno, Arkońskie-Niemierzyn, Zawadzkiego-Klonowica, and Głębokie-Pilchowo. It constitutes a section of voivodeship road 115. Some press articles, tourist brochures, websites and even the official website of Szczecin City Hall claim that Wojska Polskiego is the longest street in Szczecin. However, the longest street is Floriana Krygiera Street (formerly Autostrada Poznańska), which is approximately 8.5 kilometres long.
