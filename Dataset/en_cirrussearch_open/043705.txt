IRNSS-1I is an Indian navigational satellite that forms part of the Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System. IRNSS-1I is the ninth satellite launched for the IRNSS constellation and one of five IRNSS satellites currently operational. The satellite is intended to replace the failed IRNSS-1A, and complete the constellation of geosynchronous navigation satellites after IRNSS-1H failed to do so. The satellite's assembly, integration and testing is partly done by a consortium of six small firms led by Alpha Design Technologies, a Bengaluru-based aerospace firm under URSC's supervision.
