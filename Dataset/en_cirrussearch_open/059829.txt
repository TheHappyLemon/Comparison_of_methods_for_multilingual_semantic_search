Face/Off is a 1997 American science-fiction action thriller film directed by John Woo, from a screenplay by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary. It stars John Travolta and Nicolas Cage as an FBI agent and a terrorist, respectively, who undergo an experimental surgery to swap their faces and, in the process, their identities. The film co-stars Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, and Alessandro Nivola, and features Dominique Swain, Nick Cassavetes, Harve Presnell, Colm Feore, CCH Pounder and Thomas Jane in supporting roles. Principal photography began on January 4, 1997 in Los Angeles, and wrapped on April 1. The film score was composed by John Powell. Face/Off was the first Hollywood film in which Woo was given major creative control. It earned critical acclaim for the performances by Cage and Travolta and its stylized action sequences. The film earned $245Â million worldwide, making it the 11th highest-grossing film of 1997, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing (Mark Stoeckinger and Per Hallberg) at the 70th Academy Awards. Since its release, the film gained a strong cult following and it is considered by many as one of John Woo's best films.
