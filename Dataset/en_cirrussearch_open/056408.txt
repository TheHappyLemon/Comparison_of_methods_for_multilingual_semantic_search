The Ropotamo (Bulgarian: Ропотамо [ropoˈtamo], from the Ancient Greek word Ροπόταμος ropotamos meaning "border river") is a river in south-eastern Bulgaria. It takes its source from the Bosna Ridge in the Strandzha Mountains, running for 48.5 km to empty into the Black Sea near Cape Saint Demetrius between Dyuni and Primorsko. The river is most often noted for its 30 m-wide mouth that is home to an abundance of flora species, over 100 of which endangered in the country. The lower section of the river is a protected area since 1940 and forms part of the Ropotamo Reserve. The lower Ropotamo is a popular tourist attraction because of the water lilies and the rock formations above the river, on some of which white-tailed eagles nest. Ropotamo Glacier on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Ropotamo River.
