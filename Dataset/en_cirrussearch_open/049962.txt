Wrestling at the 1980 Summer Olympics was represented by twenty events (all â€” men's individual). They were split into two disciplines (ten events each): Freestyle and Greco-Roman. All events were held in the Wrestling hall of the Sports Complex of the Central Sports Club of the Army (north-western part of Moscow) between 20 and 31 July.
