4G is the fourth generation of broadband cellular network technology, succeeding 3G and preceding 5G. A 4G system must provide capabilities defined by ITU in IMT Advanced. Potential and current applications include amended mobile web access, IP telephony, gaming services, high-definition mobile TV, video conferencing, and 3D television. However, in December 2010, the ITU expanded its definition of 4G to include Long Term Evolution (LTE), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and Evolved High Speed Packet Access (HSPA+). The first-release WiMAX standard was commercially deployed in South Korea in 2006 and has since been deployed in most parts of the world. The first-release LTE standard was commercially deployed in Oslo, Norway, and Stockholm, Sweden in 2009, and has since been deployed throughout most parts of the world. However, it has been debated whether the first-release versions should be considered 4G. The 4G wireless cellular standard was defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and specifies the key characteristics of the standard, including transmission technology and data speeds. Each generation of wireless cellular technology has introduced increased bandwidth speeds and network capacity. 4G has speeds of up to 150 Mbit/s download and 50 Mbit/s upload, whereas 3G had a peak speed of 7.2 Mbit/s download and 2 Mbit/s upload. As of 2022,[update] 4G technology accounted for 60 percent of all mobile connections worldwide.
