Mitral Valve Prolapse murmur at mitral area Heart sounds of a 16-year-old girl diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation. Auscultating her heart, a systolic murmur and click are heard. Recorded with the stethoscope over the mitral valve. Mitral Valve Prolapse murmur at tricuspid area Her heart sounds while holding her breath. Recorded with the stethoscope over the tricuspid valve. Mitral Valve Prolapse murmur at tricuspid area after exercising Her heart sounds during recovery after running. Recorded with the stethoscope over the tricuspid valve. Problems playing these files? See media help. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a valvular heart disease characterized by the displacement of an abnormally thickened mitral valve leaflet into the left atrium during systole. It is the primary form of myxomatous degeneration of the valve. There are various types of MVP, broadly classified as classic and nonclassic. In severe cases of classic MVP, complications include mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis, congestive heart failure, and, in rare circumstances, cardiac arrest. The diagnosis of MVP primarily relies on echocardiography, which uses ultrasound to visualize the mitral valve. MVP is the most common valvular abnormality, and is estimated to affect 2â€“3% of the population and 1 in 40 people might have it. The condition was first described by John Brereton Barlow in 1966. It was subsequently termed mitral valve prolapse by J. Michael Criley. Although mid-systolic click (the sound produced by the prolapsing mitral leaflet) and systolic murmur associated with MVP were observed as early as 1887 by physicians M. Cuffer and M. Barbillon using a stethoscope.
