Goosebumps is a 2015 American horror comedy film directed by Rob Letterman and written by Darren Lemke, based on R. L. Stine's children's horror book series of the same name. The film stars Jack Black as a fictionalized version of Stine, who teams up with his neighbor (Dylan Minnette) and his teenage daughter (Odeya Rush), to save their hometown after all the monsters from the Goosebumps franchise escape from his works, wreaking havoc in the real world. It also stars Amy Ryan, Ryan Lee, and Jillian Bell in supporting roles. Development on a Goosebumps film adaptation began in the 1990s with Tim Burton and George A. Romero attached to direct. After failing to find a script to determine which book to adapt, the project was halted. In early 2008, Columbia acquired the rights to create a Goosebumps-based film, and the project reentered development. Principal photography lasted from April to July 2014 in Candler Park, Atlanta. Goosebumps was theatrically released in the United States on October 16, 2015, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film was a commercial success, grossing $158 million against its $84 million budget, and received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its humor, pacing, and faithfulness to the Goosebumps franchise. A standalone sequel, Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween, was released on October 12, 2018, with only Black returning as Stine in an uncredited supporting role.
