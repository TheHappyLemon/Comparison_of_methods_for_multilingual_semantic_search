The giant barb, Siamese giant carp, or simply Siamese carp (Catlocarpio siamensis; Khmer: ត្រីគល់រាំង, trei kól reăng; Thai: กระโห้, RTGS: kraho, Thai pronunciation: [krā.hôː], or กะมัน, RTGS: kaman, Thai pronunciation: [kā.mān]; Vietnamese: cá Hô) is the largest species of cyprinid in the world. These migratory fish are found only in the Mae Klong, Mekong, and Chao Phraya River basins in Indochina. Populations have declined drastically due to habitat loss and overfishing, and the giant barb is now considered critically endangered.
