Elektra Natchios (UK: /ˈnætʃiɒs/, US: /-oʊs/) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually in supporting roles featuring the superhero Matt Murdock / Daredevil, to whom Elektra has functioned as a villainous adversary, love interest, and later, a heroic ally. Created by Frank Miller, the character first appeared in Daredevil #168 (Jan. 1981). In the various storylines in which the character has appeared since her debut, her violent nature and mercenary lifestyle has served as a divisive point of conflict between her and Daredevil, which in 2020, culminated in her becoming the second Daredevil. The character is a highly trained assassin of Greek descent who wields a pair of sai as her trademark weapons. Elektra is one of Frank Miller's best-known creations, and has appeared in numerous modern storylines even though Marvel had originally promised not to revive the character without Miller's permission. She has also appeared as a supporting character of the X-Men's Wolverine and in other series and mini-series, as well as in adaptations for the screen. Jennifer Garner portrayed Elektra in the films Daredevil (2003) and Elektra (2005), and will reprise the role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), while Élodie Yung portrayed the character in the MCU Netflix television series Daredevil (2016) and The Defenders (2017).
