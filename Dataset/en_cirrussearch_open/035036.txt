In mathematics, a divisor of an integer n,{\displaystyle n,} also called a factor of n,{\displaystyle n,} is an integer m{\displaystyle m} that may be multiplied by some integer to produce n.{\displaystyle n.} In this case, one also says that n{\displaystyle n} is a multiple of m.{\displaystyle m.} An integer n{\displaystyle n} is divisible or evenly divisible by another integer m{\displaystyle m} if m{\displaystyle m} is a divisor of n{\displaystyle n}; this implies dividing n{\displaystyle n} by m{\displaystyle m} leaves no remainder.
