Metis (minor planet designation: 9 Metis) is one of the larger main-belt asteroids. It is composed of silicates and metallic nickel-iron, and may be the core remnant of a large asteroid that was destroyed by an ancient collision. Metis is estimated to contain just under half a percent of the total mass of the asteroid belt. Metis passed within 0.034AU, or 5,000,000 kilometres (3,100,000Â mi), of Vesta on 19 August 2004.
