Tropak (Ukrainian: трoпак) or trepak (Russian: трeпак; Ukrainian: тріпак) is a traditional Russian and Ukrainian folk dance. The tropak shares many musical and choreographic characteristics with the better known hopak. Both developed as Cossack social dances, performed at celebratory occasions. The tropak differs from the hopak in chordal use and also in that the tempo gradually speeds up throughout the dance.
