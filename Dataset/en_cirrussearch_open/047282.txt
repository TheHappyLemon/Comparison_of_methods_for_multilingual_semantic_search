The Slovak Extraliga, known as the Tipos Extraliga since the 2020–21 season for sponsorship reasons, is the highest-level ice hockey league in Slovakia. From 2018–19 to 2020–21, the league included one or two teams from Hungary. Teams from the Extraliga can participate in the IIHF's annual Champions Hockey League (CHL). Participation is based on the strength of the various leagues in Europe (excluding the KHL). In the 2022–23 CHL season, the Extraliga was ranked the No. 10 league in Europe, so the champion of the previous season competed in the CHL. The 1993–94 season was the first of the Slovak Extraliga following the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia midway through the 1992–93 Czechoslovak Extraliga season – which all Slovak and Czech teams played to completion.
