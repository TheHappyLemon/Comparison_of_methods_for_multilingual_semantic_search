Simone Inzaghi (Italian pronunciation: [siˈmoːne inˈtsaːɡi]; born 5 April 1976) is an Italian professional football manager and former player. He is the head coach of Serie A club Inter Milan. The younger brother of Filippo Inzaghi, Simone played as a striker for a host of clubs during his professional career, including Piacenza and Lazio. He remained at the Roman club for more than a decade, winning major honours including a scudetto in the 1999–2000 season, a European Super Cup, four Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana. Inzaghi earned three caps for Italy in as many years. Following his retirement from playing, Inzaghi embarked on a managerial career, initially in Lazio's youth teams before taking charge of the senior side in 2016 and guiding them to a Coppa Italia and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. In 2021, he was appointed as manager of Inter Milan, winning a further two Coppa Italia, and three back to back Supercoppa Italiana, as well as reaching the final of the UEFA Champions League in 2023. As a manager, Inzaghi is known for employing the 3–5–2 formation, being one of several Italian coaches who have led a notable revival of this tactical system.
