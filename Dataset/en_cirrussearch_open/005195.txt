Leningradskiy Island is an ice-covered island situated at the head of Leningradskiy Bay at the western margin of the Lazarev Ice Shelf, Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. The feature rises nearly 100 metres (330Â ft) above the general level of the ice shelf which surrounds all but the northern side. It was discovered and mapped by the Soviet Antarctic Expedition in 1961, and named in association with Leningradskiy Bay.
