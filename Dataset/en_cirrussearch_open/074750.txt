A pony (also "poney") is a type of small horse (Equus ferus caballus). Depending on the context, a pony may be a horse that is under a given height at the withers, or a small horse with a specific conformation and temperament. Compared to a larger horse, a pony may have a thicker coat, mane and tail, with proportionally shorter legs, a wider barrel, heavier bone, a thicker neck and a shorter, broader head. The word pony derives from the old French poulenet, meaning foal, a young, immature horse.: 1041  Small horses and ponies were traditionally used for riding, driving and as pack beasts. During the Industrial Revolution, particularly in Great Britain, many were used as pit ponies, hauling loads of coal in the mines. In the modern era they may be kept as children's mounts, for recreational or competitive riding or driving, or for cultural or conservation reasons. In modern use, some organizations may define a pony as a mature horse below a certain height at the withers; this may vary from about 142 cm (14.0 h) to nearly 150 cm (14.3 h).[citation needed] (Note: 14.3 hands means 14 hands and 3 inches, ie decimally 14.75 hands.) Some people classify an animal as either horse or pony from its pedigree and phenotype, no matter what its height.[citation needed] A full-sized horse may sometimes even be called a pony as a term of endearment.
