Fredua Koranteng Adu (born June 2, 1989) is an American former professional soccer player who played as an attacking midfielder. The last club he played for was Ettan Fotboll club Österlen FF in 2021. From before the time of his signing with D.C. United at the age of 14, Adu was spoken of as "the next Pelé." However, after leaving D.C. United in 2006, he became a journeyman, playing for fifteen teams in nine countries: the United States, Portugal, Monaco, Greece, Turkey, Brazil, Serbia, Finland, and Sweden. At D.C. United, Adu broke several records. First, he became the youngest athlete ever to sign a professional contract in the United States at 14 years old, after he was selected by the team in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft in January 2004. Three months later, he became the youngest player to appear in a Major League Soccer (MLS) game when he came on as a substitute in a game against the San Jose Earthquakes, and on April 17, he became the youngest scorer in MLS history, scoring a goal in a 3–2 loss to the MetroStars. Making his full international debut for the United States national team at the age of 16 in 2006, he has won 17 caps for his country and was a part of the US squads at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup as well as at the 2009 and 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cups. He also represented the United States Olympic team at the 2008 Summer Olympics.
