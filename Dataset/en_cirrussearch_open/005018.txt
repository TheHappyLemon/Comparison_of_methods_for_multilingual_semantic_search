The 1990 NHL Entry Draft was the 28th NHL Entry Draft. It was hosted by the Vancouver Canucks at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, on June 16, 1990. It is remembered as one of the deeper drafts in NHL history, with fourteen of the twenty-one first round picks going on to careers of at least 500 NHL games.[citation needed] Nine of the twenty-one players drafted in the first round played 1,000 NHL games in their career. The last active player in the NHL from this draft class was Jaromir Jagr, who played his last NHL game in the 2017â€“18 season. As of 2023, Jagr is still an active player with Rytiri Kladno of the ELH.
