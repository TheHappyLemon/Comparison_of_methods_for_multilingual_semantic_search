Tanjungbalai, also colloquially written as Tanjung Balai, is a city in North Sumatra province, Indonesia, on the estuary of the Asahan River. It has an area of 60.52 square kilometers (23.37 sq mi) and the sixth largest kota (urban) population in North Sumatra with 154,445 inhabitants in the 2010 census and 176,027 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 183,170 - comprising 92,715 males and 90,455 females. The town has a ferry terminal with services to Port Klang, Malaysia, and the city-island of Singapore. Formerly known as Tanjungbalai-Asahan, this area was once a district within Asahan Regency until it was granted city status in 1984. However, the identifier "Asahan" is still used to distinguish it from the port of the same name on Great Karimun island. After the separation of Tanjungbalai from Asahan Regency, it technically became an enclave within the regency.
