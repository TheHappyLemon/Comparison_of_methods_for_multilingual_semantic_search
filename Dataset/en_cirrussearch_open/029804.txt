Combat 18 (C18 or 318) is a neo-Nazi terrorist organisation that was founded in 1992. It originated in the United Kingdom with ties to movements in Canada and the United States. Since then, it has spread to other countries, including Germany. Combat 18 members have been suspected of being involved and directly responsible in the deaths of numerous immigrants, non-whites, dissidents, and the German politician Walter LÃ¼bcke as well as internecine killings of Combat 18 members. On 21 June 2019, the government of Canada added Combat 18 (alongside its affiliate Blood & Honour) to its list of terrorist organisations, which was the first time that a far-right group was added to the list. Members in the UK are barred from joining the UK Prison Service, the armed forces, and police. On 23 January 2020, the German government announced a ban of the German offshoot of Combat 18.
