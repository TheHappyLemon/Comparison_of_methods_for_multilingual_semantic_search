The Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal is a one-day professional bicycle road race held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Its first edition was held on September 12, 2010 as the final event in the 2010 UCI ProTour. The Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal and the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, held two days earlier, are collectively known as the "Laurentian Classics". In 2014, Simon Gerrans became the first to achieve the "Laurentian Double" by winning both the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec and the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal in the same year (although Robert Gesink was a winner in Montréal in 2010 and Québec in 2013). In 2018, Michael Matthews became the second cyclist to achieve this double. Iterations of the circuit have been used for the 1974 UCI Road World Championships, when Eddy Merckx won, and the 1976 Summer Olympics. The 1988 to 1992 Grand Prix des Amériques, part of the UCI Road World Cup from 1989 to 1992, also used a similar route in the same area. After a two-year hiatus due to the Covid pandemic, the event will resume September 2022 with races in Quebec City on September 9 and in Montreal on September 11.
