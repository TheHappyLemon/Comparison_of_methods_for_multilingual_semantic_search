Cabinet of Folksongs or Cabinet of Dainas (Latvian: Dainu skapis) is a cabinet 160 cm (63 in) tall, 66 cm (26 in) wide, and 42 cm (17 in) deep, in which all Latvian folksongs (dainas) collected by Latvian folklorist Krišjānis Barons are stored. The cabinet itself was made in Moscow in 1880 after Barons' draft. In 2001, the Cabinet of Folksongs was included in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register. The cabinet contains documents that preserve traditions and other details about pre-Christian Latvian tribes.
