The Stone Bridge (Macedonian: Камен мост; Albanian: Ura e gurit; Turkish: Taşköprü) is a bridge across the Vardar River in Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, built by Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror. The bridge is also less frequently known as the Dušan Bridge (Macedonian and Serbian: Душанов мост, romanized: Dušanov most) after Stefan Dušan, Emperor of Serbia. The bridge is considered a symbol of Skopje and is the main element of the coat of arms of the city, which in turn is incorporated in the city's flag. It is located in Centar Municipality and it connects Macedonia Square to the Old Bazaar.
