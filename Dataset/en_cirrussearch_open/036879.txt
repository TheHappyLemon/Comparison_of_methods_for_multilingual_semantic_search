Aach (German pronunciation: [ˈaːx] ) is a small town in the German state of Baden-Württemberg (the region of Hegau). Being situated close to Lake Constance and the Swiss border, it is mostly known for the Aachtopf — Germany's biggest natural spring in terms of production. The town was originally twinned with the region of Colmnitz, but following the integration of Colmnitz into Klingenberg, Saxony the town is now twinned with Klingenberg itself.
