Order and Justice (Lithuanian: Tvarka ir teisingumas, TT), formerly the Liberal Democratic Party (Liberalų Demokratų Partija, LDP) was a right-wing national-conservative political party in Lithuania that self-identified as "left-of-centre", at least on economic matters.[citation needed] It had eight members in the Seimas, the unicameral Lithuanian parliament, as of the last election it participated in (2016). Formed as the 'Liberal Democratic Party' in 2002, the party achieved almost immediate success with the election of leader Rolandas Paksas as President of Lithuania within its first year. Paksas's impeachment led to the party reorganising itself as 'Order and Justice' to compete in the 2004 parliamentary election. Since then, it was the fourth-largest party in the Seimas, and finished third in the elections to the European Parliament and to the presidency. The party sat on the right, possessed a radical and anti-establishment identity, and has been described as both socially conservative and 'liberal' or 'right-liberal', in line with its original identity. Its support was strongest in the north-west Samogitia region. The party's two MEPs sat in the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group in the European Parliament, with the party having previously belonged to the now-defunct Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN) and Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) groups. In 2020, the party chairman Remigijus Žemaitaitis signed an agreement with the chairman of the Lithuanian Freedom Union (Liberals), Artūras Zuokas, and former MP Arturas Paulauskas to unite their political movements to form the Freedom and Justice party.
