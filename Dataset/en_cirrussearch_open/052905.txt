The Srebarna Nature Reserve (Bulgarian: Природен резерват Сребърна, transliterated as Priroden rezervat Srebarna) is a nature reserve in northeastern Bulgaria (Southern Dobruja), near the village of the same name, 18 kilometers (11 mi) west of Silistra and two kilometers (1.2 mi) south of the Danube. It comprises Lake Srebarna and its surroundings and is an important wetland located on the Via Pontica, a bird migration route between Europe and Africa. As a result, it provides nesting and migratory habitat for many endangered bird species. The reserve embraces six square kilometers (2.3 sq mi) of protected area and a buffer zone of 5.4 square kilometers (2.1 sq mi). The lake's depth varies from one to three meters (3.3 to 9.8 ft). There is a museum constructed, where a collection of stuffed species typical for the reserve is arranged.
