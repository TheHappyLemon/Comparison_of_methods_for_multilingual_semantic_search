Avdiivka (Ukrainian: Авдіївка, IPA: [ɐu̯ˈd(j)ijiu̯kɐ]; Russian: Авдеевка, romanized: Avdeyevka, IPA: [ɐvˈdʲe(j)ɪfkə]) is a city in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. The city is located in the centre of the oblast, just north of the regional centre, Donetsk. The large Avdiivka Coke Plant is located in Avdiivka. The city had a population of 31,392 (2022 estimate) before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but it was reported as 1,600 in October 2023, and then "just over 1,000", mostly living below ground level. Avdiivka was within the claimed boundaries of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, before Russia declared its annexation of the region in September 2022. During the war in Donbas, Avdiivka became a frontline city and saw a battle in 2017. During the Russian invasion beginning in 2022, heavy fighting led to most of its population fleeing and the city being largely destroyed. It was captured by Russian forces on 17 February 2024, when Ukrainian forces fled to avoid encirclement.
