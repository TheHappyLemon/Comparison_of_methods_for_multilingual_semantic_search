"Don't Cha" is a song written by Busta Rhymes and CeeLo Green, and produced by the latter. The chorus is a slightly modified interpolation of the chorus line sung by Sir Mix-a-Lot in a song he wrote called "Swass" (1988). The song was originally recorded and published in 2004 by Tori Alamaze, former backing vocalist for the hip hop duo OutKast, and was released as her debut single. After minor success, and dissatisfaction with Universal Records, Alamaze gave up her rights to the song. The Pussycat Dolls, an American burlesque dance troupe who were poised to reinvent themselves as a pop music girl group, were offered the song from Universal. The group recorded a new version of "Don't Cha" with raps from Busta Rhymes and released it in 2005 as the lead single from their debut studio album PCD. The Pussycat Dolls' version received positive reviews from music critics, many of whom highlighted it as a standout track from the album; however, some of them criticized Busta Rhymes' appearance. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and atop the Dance Club Songs and Pop 100 charts. Outside the United States, "Don't Cha" topped the charts in 15 countries. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Paul Hunter and featured the group doing various activities, including jumping on a trampoline and drag racing in Jeeps.
