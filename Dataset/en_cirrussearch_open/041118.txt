Kevin Antonio Joel Gislain Mirallas y Castillo (born 5 October 1987), known as Kevin Mirallas (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkeβim miˈɾaʎas]), is a Belgian former professional footballer who played as a winger. Mirallas started his professional career in France with Lille and Saint-Étienne before moving to Greece with Olympiacos in 2010. Mirallas enjoyed success during his time at Olympiacos, scoring 34 goals in 52 league games. He was top scorer in his second season with Olympiacos with 20 goals in 25 games. His impressive performances attracted the attention of Everton, who signed him in the summer of 2012 for £6 million. After featuring regularly for the Merseyside club in the next five and a half seasons, he was loaned back to Olympiacos in January 2018, spending the remainder of the season there, as well as having another loan spell at Fiorentina during the following season. Mirallas spent the last four seasons of his professional career at four different clubs, first returning to his home country with Royal Antwerp. He then went on to play for Turkish side Gaziantep, Portuguese side Moreirense, and then finally ended his career after a season-long stint in Cyprus with AEL Limassol. Mirallas represented Belgium at various youth levels and then went on to earn 60 caps for the senior national team, making his debut in 2007. He featured for Belgium at two major tournaments, first appearing at the 2008 Olympics and most notably at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
