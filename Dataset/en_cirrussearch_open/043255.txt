Jorge Luis Sampaoli Moya (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈxoɾxe sampaˈoli]; born 13 March 1960) is an Argentine football coach who was most recently the head coach of Campeonato Brasileiro Série A club Flamengo. Sampaoli started out as a youth player and eventually switched to management after a severe injury. Sampaoli started with an impressive coaching run at Coronel Bolognesi of Peru in 2004, and continued with brief but successful terms at O'Higgins of Chile and Emelec of Ecuador. Sampaoli earned praise as the head coach of Universidad de Chile, winning three league titles and the Copa Sudamericana championship. This success led him to coach the Chilean men's national team in 2012, replacing Claudio Borghi. He led the Chile national football team to their first Copa América title, after defeating Argentina in the final in the 2015 tournament in Chile. He is well known for his attacking tactics which are similar to those of Marcelo Bielsa, according to the press and fans alike. On 28 June 2016, Sampaoli signed a two-year contract with Sevilla. After spending only one year in Spain and leading Sevilla to fourth spot in La Liga, and ensuring Champions League football the following season, Sampaoli left the club to coach the Argentina national team, where he left by mutual consent, after a disappointing run in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He eventually agreed to coach Brazilian club Santos in 2019, staying one year and leading the club to the second position in the league. In March 2021, he returned to manage in European football when he was appointed at French side Marseille. In October 2022, he returned to manage Sevilla. On 21 March 2023, he was sacked by Sevilla and replaced by José Luis Mendilibar.
