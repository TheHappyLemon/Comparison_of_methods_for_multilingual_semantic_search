Wout van Aert (born 15 September 1994) is a Belgian professional road and cyclo-cross racer who rides for UCI WorldTeam Visma–Lease a Bike. Van Aert won three consecutive men's races at the UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Having initially prioritised competing in cyclo-cross, Van Aert terminated his contract with Vérandas Willems–Crelan in 2018 and joined Team Jumbo–Visma in March 2019, on a three-year deal. Van Aert has since taken more than thirty professional road wins, including nine stage victories at the Tour de France between 2019 and 2022 (also winning the points classification in 2022), and won Milan–San Remo – one of the five Cycling monuments – in 2020. Following the 2022 Tour de France, where Van Aert won three stages, several media outlets labeled him as "one of the most complete cyclists of his generation". His rivalry with Mathieu van der Poel is considered among the greatest and longest lasting rivalries in the sport.
