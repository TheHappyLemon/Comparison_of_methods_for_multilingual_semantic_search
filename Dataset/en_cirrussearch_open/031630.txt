Zinc hydroxide Zn(OH)2 is an inorganic chemical compound. It also occurs naturally as 3 rare minerals: w√ºlfingite (orthorhombic), ashoverite and sweetite (both tetragonal). Like the hydroxides of other metals, such as lead, aluminium, beryllium, tin and chromium, Zinc hydroxide (and Zinc oxide), is amphoteric. Thus it will dissolve readily in a dilute solution of a strong acid, such as HCl, and also in a solution of an alkali such as sodium hydroxide.
