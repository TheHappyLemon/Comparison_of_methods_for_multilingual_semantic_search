The Armenian Premier League (Armenian: IDBank Հայաստանի Պրեմիեր Լիգա, known as the IDBank Armenian Premier League for sponsorship reasons) is the top football competition in Armenia. From 1936 to 1991, the competition was held as a regional tournament within the USSR. Following Armenia's independence, the Football Federation of Armenia has been the governing authority of the league. Over the years, the league has evolved into a small league consisting of ten teams. The winner of the league is awarded a spot in the first qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League.
