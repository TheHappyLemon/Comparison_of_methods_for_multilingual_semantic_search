The Prague Metro (Czech: Pražské metro) is the rapid transit network of Prague, Czech Republic. Founded in 1974, the system consists of three lines (A, B and C) serving 61 stations (predominantly with island platforms), and is 65.2 kilometres (40.5 mi) long. The system served 568 million passengers in 2021 (about 1.55 million daily). Two types of rolling stock are used on the Metro: the 81-71M (a completely modernized variant of the original 81-717/714.1), and the Metro M1. All the lines are controlled automatically from the central dispatching, near I.P. Pavlova station. The Metro is operated by the Prague Public Transit Company (Dopravní podnik hlavního města Prahy [cs], DPP), and integrated in the Prague Integrated Transport (Pražská integrovaná doprava, PID) system.
