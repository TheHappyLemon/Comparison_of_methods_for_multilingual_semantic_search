Glostrup is a Danish town in Region Hovedstaden, forming one of the western suburbs of Copenhagen. It is the administrative seat of Glostrup Municipality, with an estimated population of 22,357 as of 2015[update]. During the 20th century Glostrup developed from a small railroad town into a modern middle class suburb. The population reached a peak during the 1970s flight from central Copenhagen, but has since stabilized.

Along with the surrounding municipalities, it forms the center of Copenhagen's productive industry. Glostrup Municipality has a total of 21,200 jobs in the private and public sectors combined. Glostrup is also home to a series of public offices and institutions, e.g. KÃ¸benhavns Vestegn Police Departement and Glostrup Court, covering the western and northern suburbs of Copenhagen.
