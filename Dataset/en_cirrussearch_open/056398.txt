Terrassa (Catalan pronunciation: [təˈrasə], Spanish: Tarrasa) is a city in central-eastern Catalonia (Spain). It is one of the two capitals of Vallès Occidental county, along with Sabadell. The name Terrassa derives from Latin Terracia, either from earlier Terracium castellum (“earthen castle”), or meaning "terrace", "area of flat land". It is the site of Roman Egara [ca], a former Visigothic bishopric, which became a Latin Catholic titular see. Since 2004, it is again the see of a bishopric. The city is located in the Catalan Prelitoral depression (Depressió Prelitoral), at the feet of the Prelitoral mountain range (natural reserve of Sant Llorenç del Munt [ca]) and the average altitude of the city is 277 meters above sea level. It is 20 and 18 kilometres from Barcelona and Montserrat respectively. Terrassa is the fourth largest city in Catalonia, after Barcelona, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat and Badalona.
