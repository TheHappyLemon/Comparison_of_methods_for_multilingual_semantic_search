Geräusch ("Noise" or "Sound") is a studio album by German rock band Die Ärzte. The album was sold on two CDs that look like LPs. The package is designed, using upside-down techniques, to make it difficult to decide which of the covers is the front. It's also the first album of the band that tuned their instruments (guitar and bass) a half step down from the standard tuning, leaving them on E♭ tuning onwards.
