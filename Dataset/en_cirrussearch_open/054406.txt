The Coordination Council for the Transfer of Power (CCTP, Belarusian: Каардынацыйная рада, romanized: Kaardynacyjnaja rada; Russian: Координационный совет, romanized: Koordinatsionnyy sovyet) is a non-governmental body created by presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya to facilitate a democratic transfer of power in Belarus. The council, founded during the 2020 Belarusian protests in response to the disputed 2020 Belarusian presidential election, has 64 core members (as of 13 February 2021[update]) with a 7-member leadership presidium. The first meeting of the Council took place on 18 August 2020. From late August to mid-October several of the presidium members were arrested or chose to exile themselves from Belarus, fearing repression by Belarusian security forces. In September 2020, Lithuania, where the council was based as of 2020[update], became the only sovereign state to recognize the CCTP as the sole legitimate government of Belarus.
