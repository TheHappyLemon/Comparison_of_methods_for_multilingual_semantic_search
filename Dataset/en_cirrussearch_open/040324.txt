Athletic Club Sparta Praha (Czech pronunciation: [ˈaː ˈtsɛː ˈsparta ˈpraɦa]), commonly known as Sparta Prague and Sparta Praha, is a professional football club based in Prague. It is the most successful club in the Czech Republic and one of the most successful in central Europe, winning the central European Cup (also known as the Mitropa Cup) three times as well as having reached the semi-finals of the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League) in 1992 and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1973. Sparta have won a record 37 domestic league titles, the Czech Cup (and its predecessor Czechoslovak Cup) 15 times, also a record, and the Czech Supercup twice. Sparta was long the main source for the Czech Republic national football team, however lately this has ceased to be the case, as the best Czech players almost exclusively play in foreign leagues. Sparta play at Prague's Epet Arena, also known as Letná Stadium.
