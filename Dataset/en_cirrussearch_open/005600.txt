Fallingwater is a house designed by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1935. Situated in the Mill Run section of Stewart township, in the Laurel Highlands of southwest Pennsylvania, about 70 miles (110 km) southeast of Pittsburgh in the United States, it is built partly over a waterfall on the Bear Run river. The house was designed to serve as a weekend retreat for Liliane and Edgar J. Kaufmann, the owner of Pittsburgh's Kaufmann's Department Store. After its completion, Time called Fallingwater Wright's "most beautiful job" and it is listed among Smithsonian's "Life List of 28 Places to See Before You Die". The house was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 11, 1976. In 1991, members of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) named Fallingwater the "best all-time work of American architecture" and in 2007, the AIA ranked it 29th on its list of America's Favorite Architecture. In 2019, the house and seven other Wright constructions were inscribed as World Heritage Sites under the title, "The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright”.
