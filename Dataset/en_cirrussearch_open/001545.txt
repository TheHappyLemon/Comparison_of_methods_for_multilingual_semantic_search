Eduard Anatolyevich Khil (Russian: Эдуа́рд Анато́льевич Хиль, IPA: [ɨdʊˈart ɐnɐˈtolʲjɪvʲɪtɕ ˈxʲilʲ]; 4 September 1934 – 4 June 2012), often anglicized as Edward Hill, was a Soviet-Russian baritone singer. Khil became known to international audiences in 2010, when a 1976 clip of him singing a non-lexical vocable version of the song "I Am Very Glad, As I Am Finally Returning Back Home" (Russian: "Я о́чень рад, ведь я, наконе́ц, возвраща́юсь домо́й", tr. "Ya ochen rad, ved ya, nakonets, vozvrashchayus' domoy") became an Internet meme, often referred to as "Trololol" or "Trololo", or as the "Russian Rickroll", and the song became associated with Internet trolling. The song's newfound prominence in Internet culture led him to adopt Mr. Trololo as a stage name.
