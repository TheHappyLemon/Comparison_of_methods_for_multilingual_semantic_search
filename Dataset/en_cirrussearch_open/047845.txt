Bosnia and Herzegovina has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 19 times since making its debut in 1993, after coming second in the qualification round "Kvalifikacija za Millstreet". Prior to 1993, Bosnia and Herzegovina participated in the Eurovision Song Contest as part of Yugoslavia. Bosnia and Herzegovina's best result was in 2006, when Hari Mata Hari finished third with the song "Lejla". This remains the country's only top five result in the contest. The country also achieved five other top ten results: 1999 with Dino Merlin (seventh), 2004 with Deen (ninth), 2008 with Laka (tenth), 2009 with Regina (ninth), and 2011, again with Dino Merlin (sixth). Bosnia and Herzegovina returned to the contest for the first time since 2012 at the 2016 contest, where it failed to advance from the semi-finals for the first time. The country then withdrew once again from the contest and has yet to return.
