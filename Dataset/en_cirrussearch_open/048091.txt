The Qajar dynasty (Persian: دودمان قاجار, romanized: Dudemâne Ǧâjâr; 1789–1925) was an Iranian dynasty founded by Mohammad Khan (r. 1789–1797) of the Qoyunlu clan of the Turkoman Qajar tribe. The dynasty's effective rule in Iran ended in 1925 when Iran's Majlis, convening as a constituent assembly on 12 December 1925, declared Reza Shah, a former brigadier-general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, as the new shah of the Imperial State of Persia.
