Bilbeis (Arabic: بلبيس  pronounced [belˈbeːs]; Bohairic Coptic: Ⲫⲉⲗⲃⲉⲥ/Ⲫⲉⲗⲃⲏⲥ Phelbes/Phelbēs) is an ancient fortress city on the eastern edge of the southern Nile Delta in Egypt, the site of the ancient city and former bishopric of Phelbes and a Latin Catholic titular see. The city is small in size but densely populated, with over 407,300 residents. It also houses the Egyptian Air Force Academy complex, which contains the town's largest public school in Al-Zafer. Coptic tradition says that Bilbeis was one of the stopping places of the Holy Family during the Flight into Egypt.
