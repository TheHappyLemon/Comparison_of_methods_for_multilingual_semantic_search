The 2000 NHL Entry Draft was the 38th NHL Entry Draft. It was held on June 24 and 25, 2000 at the Pengrowth Saddledome in Calgary, Alberta, following the 2000 NHL Expansion Draft on June 23 for the Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild. This was the second NHL Entry Draft in which a goaltender was taken first overall (at that point), when the New York Islanders selected Rick DiPietro with the first overall pick. Previously, Michel Plasse was selected first overall in the 1968 NHL Amateur Draft. The last active players in the NHL from this draft class were Justin Williams, Ron Hainsey, Deryk Engelland and Henrik Lundqvist, who all played their last NHL games in the 2019â€“20 season.
