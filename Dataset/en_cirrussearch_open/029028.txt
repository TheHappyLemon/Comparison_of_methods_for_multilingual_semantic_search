It rises near Mouthe in the western Jura mountains, at 946 metres (3,104 ft) and its mouth is at Verdun-sur-le-Doubs, a village and commune in Saône-et-Loire at about 175 m (574 ft) above sea level. It is the tenth-longest river in France. The most populous settlement of the basin lies on its banks, Besançon. Its course includes a small waterfall and a 4-kilometre (2.5 mi) narrow lake.
