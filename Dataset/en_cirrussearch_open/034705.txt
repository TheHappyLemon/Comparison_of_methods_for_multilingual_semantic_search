Akmeņrags Lighthouse (Latvian: Akmeņraga bāka) is a lighthouse on the Latvian coast of the Baltic Sea, located to the south of the resort town of Pāvilosta. The lighthouse of Akmeņrags is a key navigation point, in one of the most dangerous spots on the Baltic Sea to navigate by - this is due to several factors: the lighthouse is located by a stony sand bank, which extends by a distance of 2 nautical miles (about 3,7 kilometres) to the north-west of the lighthouse; another point of danger is the depth of the sea - which is on average 2 metres in the lighthouse's vicinity. The location of the lighthouse has remained the same over the decade; however the coast has receded.
