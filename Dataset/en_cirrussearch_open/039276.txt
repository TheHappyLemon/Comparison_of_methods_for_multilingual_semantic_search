The 1930 presidential elections in Latvia took place in April 8 and 9, 1930, during the term of the 3rd Saeima. Incumbent president Gustavs Zemgals refused to run again, so, like in the 1927 elections, many rounds of voting were required until the Latvian Farmers' Union candidate Alberts Kviesis was elected president and became the 3rd President of Latvia.
