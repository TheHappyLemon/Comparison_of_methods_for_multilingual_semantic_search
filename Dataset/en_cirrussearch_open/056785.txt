Hiidenportti National Park (Finnish: Hiidenportin kansallispuisto) is a national park in Sotkamo in the Kainuu region of Finland. Hiidenportti National Park was established in 1982 to preserve the region's wilderness. A mosaic mix of mires and dry forests is typical landscape in this national park. The park covers 45 square kilometres (17 sq mi). Two thirds of the area is coniferous forest. The near-natural state forests are 100–150 years old on average. The last loggings were made in the beginning of the 20th century. The most well-known attraction of the park is the Hiidenportti (literally "Hiisi´s gate") gulley with vertical cliffs.
