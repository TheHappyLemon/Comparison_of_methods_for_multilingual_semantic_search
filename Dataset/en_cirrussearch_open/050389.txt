Manganese dioxide is the inorganic compound with the formula MnO 2. This blackish or brown solid occurs naturally as the mineral pyrolusite, which is the main ore of manganese and a component of manganese nodules. The principal use for MnO 2 is for dry-cell batteries, such as the alkaline battery and the zinc–carbon battery. MnO 2 is also used as a pigment and as a precursor to other manganese compounds, such as KMnO 4. It is used as a reagent in organic synthesis, for example, for the oxidation of allylic alcohols. MnO 2 has an α-polymorph that can incorporate a variety of atoms (as well as water molecules) in the "tunnels" or "channels" between the manganese oxide octahedra. There is considerable interest in α-MnO 2 as a possible cathode for lithium-ion batteries.
