Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (26 July 1791 â€“ 29 July 1844), also known as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Jr., was the youngest child of six born to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his wife Constanze and the younger of his parents' two surviving children. He was a composer, pianist, conductor, and teacher of the late classical period whose musical style was of an early Romanticism, heavily influenced by his father's mature style. He knew Franz Schubert[citation needed] and Robert Schumann, both of whom held him in high esteem.[citation needed]
