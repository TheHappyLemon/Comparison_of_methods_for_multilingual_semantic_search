Stevan Jovetić (Montenegrin: Стеван Јоветић, pronounced [stêʋaːn jǒʋetitɕ]; born 2 November 1989) is a Montenegrin professional footballer who plays as a striker for Super League Greece club Olympiacos. He also captains the Montenegro national team. Jovetić's primary position is a second striker, although he can also operate as an attacking midfielder or a winger. He is known for his dribbling, technical ability, and creativity, and his playing style has led to comparisons with Roberto Baggio. Jovetić began his career with FK Partizan, winning the double of Serbian Superliga and Serbian Cup in 2008, then joined ACF Fiorentina for an approximate €10.8 million. In five seasons at the Italian club, he scored 40 times in 134 matches, prompting an approximate €26.7 million transfer to Manchester City. In his first season in England, he won the League Cup and the Premier League. He subsequently returned to Italy to play for Inter Milan in 2015, and also had a loan spell in Spain with Sevilla in 2017, before joining Ligue 1 club Monaco later that year. Jovetić is a Montenegro international, having previously represented his team at under-21 level. He made his senior international debut in 2007, in Montenegro's first international football match as an independent country. With 35 goals, he is Montenegro's all-time top goalscorer. Jovetić is recognized as the second footballer to score at least a single goal in all of the "Big Five" leagues. He is one of the four professional football players (alongside Răducioiu, Poulsen and Justin Kluivert) to have plied his trade in the top five European leagues. Jovetić is also known for his fair play, never being booked with straight red card in his career (received second yellow card once).
