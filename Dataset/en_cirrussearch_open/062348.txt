The Estadio Akron, formerly known as the Estadio Omnilife and Estadio Chivas (Estadio Chivas, Spanish pronunciation: [esˈtaðjo ˈtʃiβas]), is a multipurpose stadium in Zapopan, near Guadalajara, in the Mexican state of Jalisco, that is used mostly for football matches. It is the home of Liga MX side C.D. Guadalajara. It is part of the JVC complex, and has a capacity of 49,813. Construction started in February 2004, but due to financial problems and other issues, the stadium's completion was delayed for a number of years. The stadium hosted its first major international event with the first leg of the 2010 Finals of the Copa Libertadores, and hosted the 2011 Pan American Games opening and closing ceremonies. The stadium's artificial field caused great controversy, drawing criticism from many notable players, and in May 2012, it was announced that the stadium would replace the artificial turf with natural grass. The stadium is also expected to host some matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
