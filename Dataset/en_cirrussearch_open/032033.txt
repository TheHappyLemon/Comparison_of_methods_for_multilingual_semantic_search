Uniper SE [ˈjuːnipɚ] is a German multinational energy company based in Düsseldorf, Germany, which has been a state-owned enterprise since late 2022. It is the biggest energy company by revenue in the world. The name of the company is a portmanteau of "unique" and "performance", which was given by long-term employee Gregor Recke. Uniper was formed by the separation of E.ON's fossil fuel assets into a separate company that began operating on 1 January 2016. In 2019, the company employed about 11,000 people in over 40 countries. In 2018, around one-third of the employees were based in Germany. Until 2022, it owned a subsidiary company in Russia called Unipro. Uniper was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The company has faced criticism for opening new coal-fueled power plants in Germany as recently as May 2020. Uniper was one of the financiers of the Nord Stream 2 project, which the German government suspended after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company was nationalised in December 2022.
