Vuhledar (Ukrainian: Вугледар, IPA: [wʊɦɫeˈdɑr] ; Russian: Угледар, romanized: Ugledar, IPA: [ʊɡlʲɪˈdar]), is a small city in Volnovakha Raion, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. At the beginning of 2022, its population was 14,144. Vuhledar is a coal mining city in the cultural and economic Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, with its origins in the 1960s development of the coal industry in the region. It was planned to be a major economic center, but failed to meet expectations, and has remained a minor economic node in the 21st century. Since March 2022, Vuhledar has been a site of fighting in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The fighting has almost completely destroyed and depopulated Vuhledar, with reportedly less than 500 civilians remaining in the city.
