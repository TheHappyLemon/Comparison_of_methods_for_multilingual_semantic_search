The Sambians were a Prussian tribe. They inhabited the Sambia Peninsula north of the city of KÃ¶nigsberg (now Kaliningrad). Sambians were located in a coastal territory rich in amber and engaged in trade early on (see Amber Road). Therefore, they established contacts with foreign nations before any other Prussians.[citation needed] However, as with all other Prussians, they were conquered by the Teutonic Knights, and, exposed to assimilation and Germanization, became extinct sometime in the 17th century. The Sambians bordered the Natangians in the south, and the Nadruvians in the east.
