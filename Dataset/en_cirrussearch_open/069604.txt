Viktor Kazimirovich Urbanovich (Russian: Виктор Казимирович Урбанович; 2 June [O.S. 21 May] 1898 – 2 June 1977) was a Belarusian Soviet Army lieutenant general. Urbanovich worked as a machinist in Riga and was conscripted into the railway troops of the Imperial Russian Army during World War I, but was discharged after being gassed. He joined the Red Army during the Russian Civil War, resuming his service in the railway troops. Between the wars, Urbanovich rose to command positions in railway units of the OGPU Troops before holding staff positions in the NKVD Border Guards. After Operation Barbarossa began, he became commander of the 257th Rifle Division, but was relieved of command after it was surrounded on the Northwestern Front. Urbanovich briefly held regimental command and a staff position before taking command of the 252nd Rifle Division at the beginning of 1942. He led the 252nd and then the 186th Rifle Division in the Battles of Rzhev, and in mid-1943 was promoted to command the 41st Rifle Corps, which he led for the rest of the war in its westward advance. Continuing his command into the early postwar period, Urbanovich commanded the 137th Rifle Corps in the early 1950s and served as an advisor to the People's Liberation Army, retiring in 1960.
