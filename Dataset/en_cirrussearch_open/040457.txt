Football Club Anzhi Makhachkala (Russian: Футбо́льный клуб «Анжи́» Махачкала́, pronounced [fʊdˈbolʲnɨj kɫup ɐnˈʐɨ məxətɕkɐˈɫa]), known simply as FC Anji, was a Russian professional football club based in the Dagestani capital of Makhachkala. Founded in 1991, the club last competed in the third-tier Russian Football National League 2. In January 2011, Anzhi Makhachkala was purchased by billionaire Suleyman Kerimov, and subsequently made numerous high-profile signings, including those of striker Samuel Eto'o and defender Roberto Carlos. Following severe budget cuts ahead of the 2013–14 Russian Premier League season, the club lost most of its key players and went on to finish bottom of the table, which resulted in relegation to the Russian National Football League at the end of the season.
