The Buddh International Circuit is an Indian motor racing circuit situated at Dankaur, near Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh. The track shares its name with Gautama Buddha, as does the district of its location. The track was officially inaugurated on 18 October 2011. The 5.125 km (3.185 mi) long circuit was designed by German racetrack designer Hermann Tilke. The circuit is best known as the venue for the annual Formula One Indian Grand Prix, which was first hosted in October 2011. However, the Grand Prix was suspended for 2014 and subsequently cancelled due to a tax dispute with the Government of Uttar Pradesh during the Akhilesh Yadav administration.
