Seda (pronunciation) is a town in Valmiera Municipality in the Vidzeme region of Latvia. It is founded in 1952. The major local industry is extraction of peat. The town is remarkable for its 1950s-style Stalinist architecture, dating from the glory days of Seda, when workers from all over the Soviet Union came to work for the peat extraction enterprise. Joint stock company "Seda" is still a major employer. The town and its people were the subject of the documentary film Seda: People of the Marsh (Latvian: Seda. Purva Ä¼audis; director Kaspars Goba; Latvia/Germany, 2004).
