The Kuban People's Republic or Kuban National Republic (Russian: Кубанская Народная Республика, romanized: Kubanskaya Narodnaya Respublika; Ukrainian: Кубанська Народна Республiка, romanized: Kubanska Narodna Respublika, abbreviated as KPR or KNR, Cyrillic: КНР) was an anti-Bolshevik state during the Russian Civil War, comprising the territory of the Kuban region in Russia. The republic was proclaimed by the Kuban Rada on 28 January 1918 and declared its independence on 16 February. It included the entire territory of the former Kuban Oblast of the Russian Empire. During its brief independence, it unsuccessfully sought union with the Ukrainian People's Republic. The Kuban People's Republic was de facto occupied by the forces of Anton Denikin on 6 November 1919, before being fully occupied and annexed by the Soviets in the spring of 1920.
