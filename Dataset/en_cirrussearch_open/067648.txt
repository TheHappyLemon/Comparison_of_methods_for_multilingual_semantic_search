Total Recall is a 2012 American science fiction action film directed by Len Wiseman from a screenplay by Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback, based on a story conceived by Wimmer, Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon, and Jon Povill. It stars Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel. The film serves as a remake of the 1990 film of the same name, which is inspired by the 1966 short story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale" by Philip K. Dick. The supporting cast features Bryan Cranston, Bokeem Woodbine, John Cho, and Bill Nighy. Unlike the original film, the setting is on a dystopian Earth, not Mars. The film was first announced in 2009. Produced by Columbia Pictures in association with producers Neal H. Moritz and Toby Jaffe's Original Film, Total Recall was released in North America on August 3, 2012, to mixed-to-negative reviews, and grossed over $211.8 million worldwide.
