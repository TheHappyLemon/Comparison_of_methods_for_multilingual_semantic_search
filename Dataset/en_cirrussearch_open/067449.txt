Tablas de Daimiel National Park (Parque Nacional de las Tablas de Daimiel) is a wetland on the La Mancha plain, a mainly arid area in the province of Ciudad Real. With an area of about 3,000 hectares, the park is the smallest of Spain's fifteen national parks. The protected area is in the process of being expanded outside the original nature reserve to include neighbouring dryland farming areas. The expansion is part of efforts to improve the condition of the wetland, which has been damaged by over-exploitation of water resources. As well as having national park status, the site enjoys international recognition, being: a wetland on the list of the Ramsar Convention (1,938 ha) the core of the Biosphere reserve Mancha HÃºmeda a Special Protection Area for birds
