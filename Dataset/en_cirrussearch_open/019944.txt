Māras ([mɑːras̪]) or Māra Day (Latvian: Māras diena; sometimes referred to as the Great Māra Day or Mother Day) was a Latvian festival, devoted to Māra, an ancient deity, and was celebrated on 15 August. According to the solar calendar, Māras marks the midpoint between Jāņi, which is summer solstice, and Miķeļi, which represents the end of the harvest season. The actual date, likely, is the result of Christian influence, identifying Māra with Virgin Mary, whose devoted holiday (Assumption of Mary) is observed on 15 August.
