Glenn Allen Youngkin (born December 9, 1966) is an American businessman and politician serving as the 74th governor of Virginia since 2022. A member of the Republican Party, he spent 25 years at the private-equity firm The Carlyle Group, where he became co-CEO in 2018. He resigned from the position in 2020 to run for governor. Youngkin won the 2021 Republican primary for Governor of Virginia and defeated former Democratic governor Terry McAuliffe in the general election, becoming the state's first Republican governor since Bob McDonnell in 2009. Youngkin supported COVID-19 vaccination efforts against the disease but opposed mandates for the vaccine, and banned mask mandates in Virginia public schools; this ban was partially rescinded following legal challenges. During his first year in office, Youngkin signed a bipartisan state budget that paired increased education spending with expansive tax cuts. He repealed protections for transgender students in Virginia schools, advocated for an abortion ban in Virginia after the Dobbs Supreme Court ruling, persistently opposed various legislative efforts to liberalize marijuana laws, and entered into a failed stadium subsidy agreement with Ted Leonsis that sought to move the Washington Wizards and Washington Nationals to Virginia from Washington D.C.
