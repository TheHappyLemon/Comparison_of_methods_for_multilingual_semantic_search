Volodymyr Borysovych Groysman (Ukrainian: Володимир Борисович Гройсман; born 20 January 1978), is a Ukrainian politician who was the Prime Minister of Ukraine from 14 April 2016 to 29 August 2019. From March 2006 until February 2014 Groysman was the Mayor of Vinnytsia. From then to November 2014, he held two concurrent positions as the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine for Regional Policy and the Minister of Regional Development, Construction and Housing and Communal Services of Ukraine. He was elected into parliament on the party lists of the pro-presidential Petro Poroshenko Bloc. Groysman's next post was the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's national parliament), starting late November 2014 until being appointed Prime Minister. In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election he took part as the party leader of the party Ukrainian Strategy. But this party failed to win any parliamentary seats. Groysman's tenure as Prime Minister ended when Oleksiy Honcharuk was appointed Prime Minister of Ukraine on 29 August 2019. In many media sources Groysman is called the first Jewish prime minister of Ukraine, although Yukhym Zvyahilsky had previously served as acting prime minister.
