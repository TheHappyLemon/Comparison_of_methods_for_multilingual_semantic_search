The club was founded in 1903 by businessman Cândido Dias da Silva and other 32 men, mostly from the large community of German immigrants of Porto Alegre. Grêmio's home stadium is the Arena do Grêmio, which the team moved to in 2013.

Prior to that, Grêmio played at Estádio Olímpico Monumental since 1954. Grêmio usually plays in a tricolor (blue, black, and white) striped shirt, black shorts, and white socks, which originated the team's nickname. In 1983, Grêmio became champions of the Intercontinental Cup after defeating Hamburger SV 2-1.
