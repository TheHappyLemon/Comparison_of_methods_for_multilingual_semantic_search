John Wick: Chapter 2 is a 2017 American neo-noir action-thriller film directed by Chad Stahelski and written by Derek Kolstad.

It stars Keanu Reeves as the title character, alongside Common, Laurence Fishburne, Riccardo Scamarcio, Ruby Rose, Lance Reddick, Peter Stormare, Bridget Moynahan, Franco Nero, John Leguizamo, and Ian McShane. In the film, retired hitman John Wick is forced back into his old life to fulfill a blood oath to crime lord Santino D'Antonio (Scamarcio). Following the box office success of the previous film, Stahelski and the first film's uncredited co-director David Leitch said a sequel film begun development in February 2015. Later that same month, Jon Feltheimer confirmed plans for additional John Wick properties to create a media franchise, and announced the return of Kolstad as the sequel's screenwriter. Principal photography began in October 2015 and lasted until early that following year, with filming taking place in Montreal, New Jersey, New York City, and Rome. John Wick: Chapter 2 had its premiere at the Arclight Hollywood in Los Angeles on January 30, 2017, and was released in the United States on February 10, by Lionsgate. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences, direction, editing, visual style, and the performances of the cast (particularly Reeves). It grossed $174.3 million worldwide, becoming the then-highest grossing film in the franchise. A sequel, John Wick: Chapter 3 â€“ Parabellum, was released in May 2019.
