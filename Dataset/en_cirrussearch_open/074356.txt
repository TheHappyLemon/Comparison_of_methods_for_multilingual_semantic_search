Mobbing, as a sociological term, refers either to bullying in any context, or specifically to that within the workplace, especially when perpetrated by a group rather than an individual. The term originated as a loanword from English which did not reflect the original English meaning, but has been loaned back into English by some sociologists to refer specifically to workplace harassment. Outside of this narrow academic sense, "mobbing" is a false friend, and the term "bullying" is usually preferred.
