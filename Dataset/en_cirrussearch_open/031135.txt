Forward caste (or General caste) is a term used in India to denote castes which are not listed in SC, ST or OBC reservation lists. They are on average considered ahead of other castes economically and educationally. They account for about 30.8% of the population based on Schedule 10 of available data from the National Sample Survey Organisation 55th (1999–2000) and National Sample Survey Organisation 61st Rounds (2004–05) Round Survey.[citation needed] Those groups that qualify for reservation benefits are listed as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Other backward class and Economically Weaker Section. They can avail defined quotas amongst other benefits for education, special government schemes, government employment and political representation. The lists of Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward class are compiled irrespective of religion.
