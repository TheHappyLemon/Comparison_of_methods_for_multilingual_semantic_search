The Municipal Stadium of Braga (Portuguese: Est√°dio Municipal de Braga) is an all-seater football stadium located in Braga, Portugal, and the current home of Sporting Clube de Braga. It has a capacity of 30,286 spectators, making it the seventh largest football stadium in Portugal. The stadium was designed by Portuguese architect Eduardo Souto de Moura who was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize in part for this design. Nicknamed A Pedreira (The Quarry), for being carved into the side of a hill at its south end, the stadium was built in 2003 as a venue for the UEFA Euro 2004.
