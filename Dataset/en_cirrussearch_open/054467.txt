CF Montréal is a Canadian professional soccer club based in Montréal. The club competes in Major League Soccer (MLS) in the Eastern Conference. Founded in 2010 as the Montreal Impact, they began playing in the MLS in 2012 as the league's nineteenth franchise and third Canadian club. They are a phoenix club of the original Montreal Impact that played in the various second division leagues of American soccer from 1993 to 2011. In 2015, the Impact was the first ever Canadian club and the second MLS club to advance to the final of the CONCACAF Champions League, where they lost to Club América. The club rebranded as Club de Foot Montréal in 2021 with a new club crest and colours. Amidst discontent and pressure from supporters and local media, the club introduced a revised logo for the 2023 season, with the club being known simply as CF Montréal. CF Montréal and its predecessor clubs have won the Voyageurs Cup, the domestic trophy for professional club soccer in Canada, a total of 11 times, five of which are within the format of the Canadian Championship, the national championship for professional clubs in Canada formed in 2008. The club competes in the Leagues Cup, the North American zonal competition for CONCACAF, and is eligible for the cross-border Campeones Cup, but does not take part in the U.S. Open Cup. The club plays its home matches at Stade Saputo and is managed by Laurent Courtois.
