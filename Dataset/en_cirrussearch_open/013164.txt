Heavenly Guardian, known in Europe as Legend of Sayuki, is a scrolling shooter game developed by Starfish SD. It was originally released on the Wii in 2007 and PlayStation 2 in 2008. The developer self-published the title in Japan, while UFO Interactive Games and 505 Games published the game in North America and Europe respectively. It was later released on the Nintendo Switch in 2018 and Windows and PlayStation 4 (only in Japan) in 2019 as Snow Battle Princess Sayuki. The game was originally planned to be an entry in Taito's Pocky & Rocky series, but due to legal issues with Square Enix, the game's title and characters were changed while maintaining the core gameplay.
