The Ford GT is a mid-engine two-seater sports car manufactured and marketed by American automobile manufacturer Ford for the 2005 model year in conjunction with the company's 2003 centenary. The second generation Ford GT became available for the 2017 model year. The GT recalls Ford's historically significant GT40, a consecutive four-time winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans (1966â€“1969), including a 1-2-3 finish in 1966. This history has inspired many movies, including the 2019 film Ford v Ferrari. In this film, they show the story of the development of the Ford GT40 mk I. The car was designed by Carroll Shelby, Phil Remington, and race car driver Ken Miles.
