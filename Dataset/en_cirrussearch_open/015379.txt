All local commuter, long-distance and international trains depart from the station. Balti jaam is located in central Tallinn, and is situated immediately northwest of the city's Old town (Estonian: Tallinna vanalinn). It stands close to a large market called the Baltic Station Market (Balti Jaama Turg). The first station opened in 1870 when a railway line connecting Saint Petersburg with Paldiski via Tallinn was opened. The station was completely reconstructed between 1960â€“1966, and in 2005, the station building was completely renewed.
