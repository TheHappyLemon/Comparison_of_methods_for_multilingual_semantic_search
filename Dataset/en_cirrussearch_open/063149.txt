"Foggy Dew" is the name of several Irish ballads, and of an Irish lament. The most popular song of that name (written by Charles O'Neill) chronicles the Easter Rising of 1916, and encourages Irishmen to fight for the cause of Ireland, rather than for the British Empire, as so many young men were doing in World War I.
