Johann Gotthelf Lindner (11 September 1729 – 29 March 1776) was a German university teacher and writer at the time of the eighteenth century Enlightenment. Johann Gotthelf Lindner was the elder brother to Ehregott Friedrich Lindner, also born in Schmolsin, and to Gottlob Immanuel Lindner (1734–1818), born in the city of Königsberg. He was therefore also an uncle to the journalist-doctor Friedrich Ludwig Lindner (1772–1845).
