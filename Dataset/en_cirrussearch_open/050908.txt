Maurizio Sarri (Italian pronunciation: [mauˈrittsjo ˈsarri]; born 10 January 1959) is an Italian professional football manager. Sarri did not play football professionally, taking part as an amateur centre back and coach while working as a banker. In 2005, he had his first Serie B job at Pescara. In 2014, Sarri won promotion to Serie A with Empoli, and after preserving their place in the top flight he was hired by Napoli. He won several individual awards while managing the Naples-based club; after finishing as league runners-up in 2017–18, Sarri moved to English club Chelsea, where he won the UEFA Europa League in his only season with the club. He returned to Italy to coach Juventus in 2019, with whom he went on to win the Serie A title in his first season, becoming the oldest manager to ever win the Serie A.
