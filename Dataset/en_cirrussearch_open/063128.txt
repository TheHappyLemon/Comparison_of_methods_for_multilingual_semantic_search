Corylus jacquemontii (Jacquemont's hazelnut or Indian tree hazel) is a species of hazel, found in Asia, within the Himalayas and from Afghanistan through to W. Nepal. It is a small tree or shrub, with grey bark, ovate or obovate (teardrop-shaped) leaves, small flowers and small edible nuts, grouped in small clusters. It has been used in many ways, not only as fuel source, fodder (for livestock) and timber but the trees also yield edible nuts for human consumption or for folk medicine uses.
