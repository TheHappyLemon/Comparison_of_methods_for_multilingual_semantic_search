Fotbal Club Rapid 1923, commonly known as Rapid București (Romanian pronunciation: [raˈpid bukuˈreʃtʲ]) or simply as Rapid, is a Romanian professional football club based in Bucharest, that competes in the Liga I. It was founded in 1923 by employees of the Grivița workshops as the Asociația Culturală și Sportivă CFR ("CFR Cultural and Sports Association"). Domestically, Rapid București is one of the most successful clubs in the country, having won three national titles, 13 Cupa României, and four Supercupa României. Internationally, its highest achievements are reaching the quarter-finals of the 1972–73 Cup Winners' Cup and the 2005–06 UEFA Cup, and the final of the 1940 Mitropa Cup—the latter not being played because of World War II. Recently, the club was declared bankrupt in 2016, but was refounded and managed to return to the top flight in 2021. From 1939, Rapid played its home matches in burgundy and white kits at the Valentin Stănescu Stadium, which was replaced by the new Rapid-Giulești in 2022. The team has fierce local rivalries with Steaua București and Dinamo București, as well as with Petrolul Ploiești.
