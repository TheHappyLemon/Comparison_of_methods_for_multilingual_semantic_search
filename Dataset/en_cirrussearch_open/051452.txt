The Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2021 was the 19th edition of the annual Junior Eurovision Song Contest, organised by France Télévisions and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The contest was held on 19 December 2021 at La Seine Musicale in Paris, France, following the country's victory at the 2020 contest with the song "J'imagine", performed by Valentina. This was the first time the contest was held in France, as well as the first Eurovision event to be held in the country since Eurovision Young Dancers 1999 in Lyon and the first to be held in Paris since Eurovision Young Dancers 1989. Nineteen countries participated in the contest, with Albania, Armenia, Ireland, Italy, North Macedonia and Portugal all returning after their absence from the previous edition. Azerbaijan and Bulgaria returned after two and four-year absences respectively. For the first time in 19 editions, Belarus did not participate, as the country's broadcaster is under a three-year suspension from the EBU, making the Netherlands the only country to have participated every year since the contest's first edition in 2003. Armenia's Maléna was the winner of the contest with the song "Qami Qami". This was Armenia's second victory in the contest, following their win in 2010. Poland, host country France, Georgia and Azerbaijan completed the top five, with this being the highest placement for Azerbaijan to date. Meanwhile, the Netherlands finished in last place for the first time in the contest's history. Ireland and Spain also achieved their lowest placings to date, the latter finishing outside the top five for the first time.
