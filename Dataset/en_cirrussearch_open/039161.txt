Charles Owen Hobaugh (born November 5, 1961, in Bar Harbor, Maine) is a former NASA astronaut and a retired U.S. Marine Corps officer. He has had three spaceflights, all of which were Space Shuttle missions to the International Space Station, lasting between 10 and 13 days. Hobaugh was selected to be an astronaut in 1996, and his first spaceflight was STS-104, for which he was designated pilot of Space Shuttle Atlantis. That mission took place in July 2001, less than a year after the space station received its first long-duration crew. His most recent spaceflight was in November 2009, STS-129 on Atlantis again; this time he was designated commander. In total, he has logged 36 days in space.
