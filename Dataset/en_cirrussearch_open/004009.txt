Kristers Serģis (born January 14, 1974) is a retired Latvian sidecarcross rider and five times World Champion. Kristers Serģis came to the sidecarcross sport through his father, himself a rider in the days of the Soviet Union. He made it possible for his son to take up the sport after Latvian independence in 1990. Through sponsorship from a timber building company in Cēsis, it was possible for him to turn professional, a rarity in this sport. To be able to keep the traveling distances short, Kristers now lives in the Netherlands but returns to Latvia in the off-season to work at his motorcycle dealership, "Kristers Serģis Moto". Kristers Serģis has been voted "Latvian sports person of the year" multiple times, winning the award in 1997, 1998 and 2000. At the end of the 2008 season, Kristers Serģis retired from the sidecarcross sport.
