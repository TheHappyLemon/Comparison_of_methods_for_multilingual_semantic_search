The Tallinn tram network (Trammiliiklus Tallinnas) is the only tram network in Estonia. Together with the four-route trolleybus network (et), the four tram lines (currently allocated into five routes), with a total length of 19.7Â km (12.2 miles) arranged in a roughly cross-shaped layout, provide a backbone for the public transport network in the Estonian capital. All the routes meet up at Hobujaama in the city centre. Trams are unidirectional, one-sided and single-person operated, and much of the network runs on segregated track. The network is operated by Tatra KT4 and KTNF6 types (the latter being former KT4s that have been extended with the addition of a low-floor middle section) and, since 2014, CAF Urbos AXLs. The trams, trolleybuses and motorbuses in Tallinn are operated by the transport operator Tallinna Linnatranspordi AS. This enterprise emerged on 19 July 2012 when Tallinna Autobussikoondis, the motorbus company was merged with Tallinna Trammi- ja Trollibussikoondis.
