In mathematics, a ball is the solid figure bounded by a sphere; it is also called a solid sphere. It may be a closed ball (including the boundary points that constitute the sphere) or an open ball (excluding them). These concepts are defined not only in three-dimensional Euclidean space but also for lower and higher dimensions, and for metric spaces in general. A ball in n dimensions is called a hyperball or n-ball and is bounded by a hypersphere or (n−1)-sphere. Thus, for example, a ball in the Euclidean plane is the same thing as a disk, the area bounded by a circle. In Euclidean 3-space, a ball is taken to be the volume bounded by a 2-dimensional sphere. In a one-dimensional space, a ball is a line segment. In other contexts, such as in Euclidean geometry and informal use, sphere is sometimes used to mean ball. In the field of topology the closed n{\displaystyle n}-dimensional ball is often denoted as Bn{\displaystyle B^{n}} or Dn{\displaystyle D^{n}} while the open n{\displaystyle n}-dimensional ball is Int⁡Bn{\displaystyle \operatorname {Int} B^{n}} or Int⁡Dn{\displaystyle \operatorname {Int} D^{n}}.
