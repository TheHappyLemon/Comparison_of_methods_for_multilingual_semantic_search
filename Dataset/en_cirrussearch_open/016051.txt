The Emajõgi (Estonian pronunciation: [ˈemɑ.jɤgi]; meaning 'mother river') is a river in Estonia which flows from Lake Võrtsjärv through Tartu County into Lake Peipus, crossing the city of Tartu for 10 km. It has a length of 100 km. The Emajõgi is sometimes called the Suur Emajõgi (Big Emajõgi), in contrast with the Väike Emajõgi (Little Emajõgi), another river which flows into the southern end of Lake Võrtsjärv. The Emajõgi is the second-largest river in Estonia by discharge and the only fully navigable river.
