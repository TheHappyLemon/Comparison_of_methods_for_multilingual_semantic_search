He is also called Maximos the Hagiorite (Μάξιμος ὁ Ἁγιορίτης), as well as Maximus the Philosopher. His signature was Maximus Grecus Lakedaimon (lit. Maximus the Greek of, and originating from, Lakedaimonia) and his family origins were probably from Mystras, a location in Laconia, which was the geographical site of Ancient Sparta in the Peloponnese.
