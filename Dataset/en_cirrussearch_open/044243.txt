Chico and Rita (Spanish: Chico y Rita) is a 2010 adult animated romantic drama film directed by Tono Errando, Fernando Trueba and Javier Mariscal.[citation needed] The story of Chico and Rita is set against backdrops of Havana, New York City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Paris in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Chico is a young piano player with big dreams. Rita is a beautiful singer with an extraordinary voice. Music and romantic desire unite them, but their journey—in the tradition of the Latin ballad, the bolero—brings heartache and torment. The film was produced by Fernando Trueba Producciones, Estudio Mariscal, and Magic Light Pictures. It received financing from CinemaNX and Isle of Man Film. It won the Goya Award for Best Animated Film at the 25th Goya Awards and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 84th Academy Awards (the first nomination for a Spanish full-length animated film).
