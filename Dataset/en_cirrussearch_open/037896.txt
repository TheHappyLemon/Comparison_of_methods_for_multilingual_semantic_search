The prime minister of Slovakia, officially the Chairman of the government of the Slovak Republic (Slovak: Predseda vlády Slovenskej republiky), commonly referred to in Slovakia as Predseda vlády or informally as Premiér, is the head of the government of the Slovak Republic. Officially, the officeholder is the third-highest constitutional official in Slovakia after the President of the Republic (appointer) and Chairman of the National Council; in practice, the appointee is the country's leading political figure. Since the creation of the office in 1969, fifteen different people have served as head of government. Since 1993, when Slovakia gained independence, nine people have occupied the function. On 25 October 2023, Robert Fico became Prime Minister of Slovakia.
