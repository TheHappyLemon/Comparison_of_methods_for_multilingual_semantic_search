The Montenegrin alphabet is the collective name given to "Abeceda" (Montenegrin Latin alphabet; Абецеда in Cyrilic) and "Азбука" (Montenegrin Cyrillic alphabet; Azbuka in Latin), the writing systems used to write the Montenegrin language. It was adopted on 9 June 2009 by the Montenegrin Minister of Education, Sreten Škuletić and replaced the Serbian Cyrillic and Gaj's Latin alphabets in use at the time. Although the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets enjoy equal status under the Constitution of Montenegro, the government and proponents of the Montenegrin language prefer to use the Latin script; it is also much more widely used in all aspects of the day-to-day written communication in the country, in education, advertising and media.
