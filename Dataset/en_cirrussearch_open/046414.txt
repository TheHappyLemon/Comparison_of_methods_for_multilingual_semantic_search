Home Alone 4 (also known as Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House or Home Alone: Taking Back the House) is a 2002 American made-for-television Christmas family comedy film directed by Rod Daniel, which first aired on ABC on November 3, 2002, as the first episode of the forty-seventh season of The Wonderful World of Disney, followed by a DVD release on September 2, 2003. The fourth installment in the Home Alone franchise, the film stars Mike Weinberg, French Stewart, Missi Pyle, Jason Beghe, Erick Avari, Barbara Babcock, Joanna Going, and Clare Carey. It follows Kevin McCallister spending his Christmas with his father and his new girlfriend as his old enemy Marv and his wife Vera come up with a plan to kidnap a visiting prince with help from an inside person that Kevin least suspects. This is the first in the Home Alone franchise to not receive a theatrical release. Home Alone 4, is the first film without any contributions from John Hughes, the man behind the "Home Alone" series, and it doesn't include any of the original cast members. Whereas Home Alone 3 featured a standalone plot and new characters, this film brings back several of the main characters from the first two films, including Kevin McCallister, but with all of the roles played by different actors. This movie is considered as non-canon to the first two films due to several continuity errors. The plot revolves around Kevin trying to defend his future stepmother's house from his old nemesis Marv and his sidekick wife Vera. It was the last film that Rod Daniel directed before his subsequent retirement, and his death in 2016. The film received negative reviews, with criticism directed towards the performances and the lack of continuity with the first two films.
