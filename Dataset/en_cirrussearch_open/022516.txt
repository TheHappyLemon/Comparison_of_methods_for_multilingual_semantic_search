Fisht Olympic Stadium (Russian: Олимпийский стадион «Фишт», Olimpiyskiy Stadion Fisht) is an outdoor stadium in Sochi, Russia. Located in Sochi Olympic Park and named after Mount Fisht, the 40,000-capacity stadium was constructed for the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, where it served as the venue for their opening and closing ceremonies.
