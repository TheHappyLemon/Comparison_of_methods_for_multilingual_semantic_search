Food spoilage is the process where a food product becomes unsuitable to ingest by the consumer. The cause of such a process is due to many many outside factors as a side-effect of the type of product it is, as well as how the product is packaged and stored. Due to food spoilage, one-third of the world's food produced for the consumption of humans is lost every year. Bacteria and various fungi are the cause of spoilage and can create serious consequences for the consumers, but there are preventive measures that can be taken.[citation needed]
