UEFA Euro 2020 was an international football tournament held across eleven cities in Europe from 11 June to 11 July 2021. The 24 national teams involved in the tournament were required to register a squad of up to 26 players – of which three had to be goalkeepers – by 1 June 2021, 23:59 CEST (UTC+2), ten days prior to the opening match of the tournament. Only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament. In the event that a player on the submitted squad list suffered from an injury or illness prior to his team's first match of the tournament, that player could be replaced, provided that the team doctor and a doctor from the UEFA Medical Committee both confirmed that the injury or illness was severe enough to prevent the player from participating in the tournament. Should a goalkeeper have suffered from an injury or illness after his team's first match of the tournament, he could still be replaced, even if the other goalkeepers from the squad were still available. A player who had been replaced on the player list could not be readmitted to the list. The position listed for each player is per the official squad lists published by UEFA. The age listed for each player is their age as of 11 June 2021, the first day of the tournament. The numbers of caps and goals listed for each player do not include any matches played after the start of the tournament. The club listed is the club for which the player last played a competitive match prior to the tournament. The nationality for each club reflects the national association (not the league) to which the club is affiliated. A flag is included for coaches who are of a different nationality to their team.
