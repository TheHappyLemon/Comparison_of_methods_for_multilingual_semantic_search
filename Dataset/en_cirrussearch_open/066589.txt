Slănčev Brjag (Bulgarian: Слънчев бряг [ˈsɫɤnt͡ʃɛf brʲak], English: Sunny Beach) is a seaside resort on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, 35 km (22 mi) north of Burgas and 94 km (58 mi) south of Varna. Created in 1958 as a weekend getaway for Bulgarian families, Sunny Beach has become the largest tourist and vacation spot in the country. Today, the area contributes a significant part of the province's annual gross domestic product. Initially a small beachside resort, it has grown to include a large variety of recreational activities and services, gambling establishments as well as sports and music venues. Its rapid growth makes it the largest resort on the entire Black Sea coast; to the south, the complex has merged with the town of Nessebar.
