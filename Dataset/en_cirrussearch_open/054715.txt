Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli (Nepali: खड्ग प्रसाद शर्मा ओली, pronounced [ˈkʰʌɽɡʌprʌsad̪ ˈoli]; born 22 February 1952) is a Nepali Communist politician, former Prime Minister of Nepal. He has served two terms as prime minister, from 11 October 2015 to 3 August 2016, and from 15 February 2018 to 13 July 2021 as the first prime minister to be appointed following the first general election under the new constitution. KP Oli is noted for taking a more hardline stance with regard to the Indian government during and in the aftermath of the 2015 Nepal blockade. He strengthened relations with China as an alternative to Nepal's traditional close trade ties with India and updated the map of Nepal by constitutional amendment including territories disputed with India, for which he has received some domestic praise and a reputation as a nationalist. While in office, Oli was marred by controversy for frequent use of tongue-in-cheek remarks, hostility towards critics and the media, silence on corruption by colleagues and business aides, failing to deliver on economic growth, and for deviating from promised budgetary expenditures despite a historic majority in the 2017 legislative election
