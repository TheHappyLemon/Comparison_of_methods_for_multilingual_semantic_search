Coppa Italia (lit. 'Italy Cup') is the annual domestic cup of Italian football. The knockout competition was organized by the DDS and the Football League until the 2009–10 season and by Lega Serie A ever since. Juventus is the competition's most successful club with fourteen wins, followed by AS Roma and Inter Milan with nine. Juventus has contested the most finals with 21, followed by Roma with 17 finals. The holder can wear a cockade of Italy (Italian: coccarda), akin to the roundels that appear on military aircraft. The winner automatically qualifies for both the UEFA Europa League group stage and the Supercoppa Italiana the following year.
