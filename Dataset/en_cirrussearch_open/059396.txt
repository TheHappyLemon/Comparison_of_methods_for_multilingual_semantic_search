Donald Mackintosh (22 September 1866 â€“ 8 September 1951) was an Australian professional sports shooter. He shot on the European live-bird circuit between 1896 and 1908, winning numerous prizes and recognition as a world champion. In 1992, he was posthumously awarded Olympic gold and bronze medals for pigeon-shooting events deemed to form part of the 1900 Summer Olympics. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) later reversed its decision and reclassified the events as non-Olympic.
