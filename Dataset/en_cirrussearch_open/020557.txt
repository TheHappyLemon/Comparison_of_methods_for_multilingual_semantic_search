Uthman ibn Affan ibn Abi al-As (Arabic: عُثْمَان بْن عَفَّان بْن أَبِي ٱلْعَاص, romanized: ʿUthmān ibn ʿAffān ibn Abī al-ʿĀṣ; c. 573 or 576 – 17 June 656) was the third Rashidun caliph, ruling from 644 until his assassination in 656. Uthman, a second cousin, son-in-law, and notable companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, played a major role in early Islamic history. During his reign as caliph, he was known for ordering the official compilation of the standardized version of the Quran that is still being used today. Before his predecessor, Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab, died in office, he appointed a committee of trustees to elect a successor. Uthman, who was then aged 68–71 years, was elected to succeed him and became the oldest person to hold such a high position. During his premiership, the Caliphate expanded further into Persia in 650 and reached as far as the provinces of Khorasan in 651. Uthman instituted centralized reforms in order to create a more cohesive administrative structure and fostered rapid economic growth. However, the last years of his reign were marked by discontent that eventually evolved into an armed revolt, leading to a siege upon his residence and ultimately culminating in his assassination.
