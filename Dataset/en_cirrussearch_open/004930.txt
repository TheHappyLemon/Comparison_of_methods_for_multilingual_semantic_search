The 2028 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXXIV Olympiad, and commonly known as Los Angeles 2028 or LA28, is an upcoming international multi-sport event scheduled to take place from July 14 to 30, 2028, in Los Angeles, California, United States. Los Angeles had originally bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. However, after multiple withdrawals that left only Los Angeles and Paris in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidates; Paris displayed a preference for the 2024 Games, and Los Angeles agreed to host 2028. The process was ratified during the 131st IOC Session on September 13, 2017. They will mark the fifth Summer Olympics (after Atlanta 1996), and ninth Olympics overall, to be hosted by the United States. Having previously hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984, Los Angeles will become the third three-time host city after London (1908, 1948, 2012) and Paris (1900, 1924, 2024). After debuting in 2020 as optional events, skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing have been promoted to the Summer Olympics' "core" event programme. Boxing, modern pentathlon, and weightlifting had been provisionally removed due to governance issues; modern pentathlon and weightlifting were reinstated following reform efforts, with the modern pentathlon expected to employ a new format replacing show jumping with obstacle course racing. The Games will feature the debut of flag football and squash as optional events proposed by the organizing committee, joined by the return of baseball/softball, cricket (for the first time since 1900) and lacrosse (for the first time since 1908).
