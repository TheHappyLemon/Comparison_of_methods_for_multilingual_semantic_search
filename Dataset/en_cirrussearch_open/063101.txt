FC Kuban (Russian: Футбольный клуб "Кубань" Краснодар) was a Russian professional football club based in Krasnodar, which now only plays on a regional level. The team began playing in the Russian Premier League in 2011, having for won the Russian First Division a year prior. By then, it was one of the oldest professional football clubs in the country, with its foundation being linked to the Soviet NKVD as Dynamo Krasnodar. It changed its name at a time of political change in the USSR. Club members and fans were called "Kubantsy" (Russian: Кубанцы) (because of its location) or "yellow-greens" (the club colours). The team was also known as the "Cossacks" by fans. Other nicknames associated with the club colours were "The Canaries" (analogous to the similar colours of the French FC Nantes and the English Norwich City F.C.) and "The Toads" (primarily by opponents and the Kuban Ultras). On 17 May 2018 it was announced that FC Kuban had dissolved because of bankruptcy. It was resurrected by fans and former footballers on a local level a few months later and the team played its first official match in the Krasnodar Krai Regional League. The club is not officially linked to the new PFC Kuban Krasnodar, which is often seen to be the successor to the club on a professional level.
