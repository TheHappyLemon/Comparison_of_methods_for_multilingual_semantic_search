Nino Niederreiter (born 8 September 1992) is a Swiss professional ice hockey winger for the Winnipeg Jets of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected fifth overall by the New York Islanders in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, making him the highest-drafted Swiss hockey player in NHL history at the time (until Nico Hischier was drafted first overall in 2017). Niederreiter made his NHL debut with the Islanders early in the 2010â€“11 season before being returned to his junior club, the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League (WHL). Prior to coming to North America, Niederreiter had played in the junior system of the Swiss team HC Davos and appeared in three playoff games for the senior club in 2010. After finding difficulty securing playtime with the Islanders, Niederreiter requested a trade and subsequently was dealt to the Minnesota Wild, where he spent parts of five seasons. In his sixth year with the Wild, he was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes, where he signed a contract to play for the following three seasons. Afterwards, he signed with the Nashville Predators, who traded him to the Jets after only part of a season when the team was falling out of playoff contention.
