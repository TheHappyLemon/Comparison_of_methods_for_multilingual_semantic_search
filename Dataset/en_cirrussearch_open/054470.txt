New York City Football Club, also known as New York City FC and shortened as NYCFC, is an American professional soccer club based in New York City. The club competes in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Eastern Conference. The club is co-owned by City Football Group, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi United Group, and Yankee Global Enterprises, owners of the New York Yankees. New York City played its first league game in the 2015 MLS season, as the twentieth expansion team of the league; it is the first franchise based in the city, and the second in the New York metropolitan area, after the New York Red Bulls, with whom they contest the Hudson River Derby. Since 2015, the club have primarily played their home games at Yankee Stadium (shared with baseball's New York Yankees) in the Bronx; several alternative venues have been used when Yankee Stadium is unavailable, such as Citi Field in Queens, and Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey. Since the 2022 season, NYCFC has played at least six of its 17 home matches at Citi Field, across the street from the site of its planned soccer-specific stadium scheduled to open in 2027. Jason Kreis was the club's first coach, before being replaced by Patrick Vieira, who guided New York City to their first MLS Cup playoff appearance and second-place finishes in the MLS Supporters' Shield standings. After five years of performing well in the regular season but falling short in the playoffs, Norwegian coach Ronny Deila won the club's first trophy, the 2021 MLS Cup. The club then won its first international trophy when they defeated Atlas at the 2022 Campeones Cup, becoming the first New York–based club to win an international trophy. Based on attendance from the 2022 regular season and valuations by Forbes, New York City was the eighteenth best attended club in the league, and the fourth most valuable, worth $800 million.
