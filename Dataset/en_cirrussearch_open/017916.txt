Christopher John Osgood (born November 26, 1972) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who is currently a Detroit Red Wings studio analyst and part-time color commentator for Bally Sports Detroit. He won three Stanley Cup championships in his career, all with the Red Wings, with two of them coming while he was starting goaltender. He is ranked 13th in wins in NHL regular season history with 401. Osgood spent the first part of his 17-year NHL career with the Red Wings, then the New York Islanders and the St. Louis Blues before returning to Detroit in 2005. Osgood was known in Detroit by his nicknames "Ozzie," chanted by the crowd after a big save, and "The Wizard of Oz." He was the last NHL goalie to wear a traditional player's helmet/cage combo instead of the newer one piece goalie mask until Rick DiPietro briefly wore one of Osgood's in 2011, after he was injured in a fight with Brent Johnson. He is also one of only 14 goaltenders in NHL history to have scored a goal, and one of only nine to have scored by shooting the puck directly into the opponent's net (not an "own goal"), on March 6, 1996 versus the Hartford Whalers.
