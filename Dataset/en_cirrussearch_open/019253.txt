Setúbal (/səˈtuːbəl/, US also /-bɑːl/, Portuguese: [sɨˈtuβal, -βɐl] ; Proto-Celtic: *Caetobrix) is a city and a municipality in Portugal. The population of the entire municipality in 2014 was 118,166, occupying an area of 230.33 km2 (88.9 sq mi). The city itself had 89,303 inhabitants in 2001. It lies within the Lisbon metropolitan area, about 50 kilometres (31 miles) from Lisbon downtown by road. In the times of Al-Andalus, the city was known as Shaṭūbar (Andalusian Arabic: شَطُوبَر [ʃeˈtˤuːbɑr]), after the old pre-Roman name of Cetobriga. In the 19th century, the port was called Saint Ubes in English, and Saint-Yves in French. The municipal holiday is 15 September, which marks the date in 1860 when King Pedro V of Portugal officially recognised Setúbal as a city.
