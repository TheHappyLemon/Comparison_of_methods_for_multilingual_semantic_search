The ideal gas law, also called the general gas equation, is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. It is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. It was first stated by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 as a combination of the empirical Boyle's law, Charles's law, Avogadro's law, and Gay-Lussac's law. The ideal gas law is often written in an empirical form: pV=nRT{\displaystyle pV=nRT} where p{\displaystyle p}, V{\displaystyle V} and T{\displaystyle T} are the pressure, volume and temperature respectively; n{\displaystyle n} is the amount of substance; and R{\displaystyle R} is the ideal gas constant. It can also be derived from the microscopic kinetic theory, as was achieved (apparently independently) by August Krönig in 1856 and Rudolf Clausius in 1857.
