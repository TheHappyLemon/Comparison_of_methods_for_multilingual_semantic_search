The Detroit Falcons were a Basketball Association of America (forerunner of the National Basketball Association) team based in Detroit. It played in the inaugural 1946â€“47 season and folded soon after the season ended, leaving Detroit without a professional basketball team until a decade later, when the Fort Wayne Pistons moved there.
