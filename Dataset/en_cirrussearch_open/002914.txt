"Best I Ever Had" is a song by Canadian rapper and singer Drake from his breakout mixtape So Far Gone. The song was later re-released on his Debut EP of the same name. The song's popularity helped Drake decide to release So Far Gone as an EP, available for purchase. "Best I Ever Had" is also included as a bonus track on Drake's debut studio album Thank Me Later in certain countries. It was released as the first single from the tape as a digital download on February 11, 2009, and later as the third single from the EP in the United Kingdom on October 11, 2010, as a double-A-side single with "Fancy". The song samples "Fallin' in Love" by Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds and "Do It For The Boy" by Lil Wayne. "Best I Ever Had" peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Drake's first top-ten single. It remained his highest charting single as a lead artist (as both Rihanna collaborations "What's My Name?" and "Work" reached No. 1) in the United States until "One Dance" (2016) peaked at number one. The song was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Song. In early 2010 it was also nominated for Single of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards, but lost to Michael Bubl√©'s "Haven't Met You Yet".
