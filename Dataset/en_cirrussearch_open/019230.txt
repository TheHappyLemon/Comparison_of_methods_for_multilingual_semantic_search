Admiralty Bay Admiralty Bay is an irregular bay, 8 km (5 mi) wide at its entrance between Demay Point and Martins Head, indenting the southern coast of King George Island for 16 km (10 mi), in the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica. The name appears on a map of 1822 by Captain George Powell, a British sailor, and is now established in international usage. The Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station is situated on the bay, as is the Comandante Ferraz Brazilian Antarctic Base. It has been designated an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA 1).
