A verb (from Latin verbumÂ 'word') is a word (part of speech) that in syntax generally conveys an action (bring, read, walk, run, learn), an occurrence (happen, become), or a state of being (be, exist, stand). In the usual description of English, the basic form, with or without the particle to, is the infinitive. In many languages, verbs are inflected (modified in form) to encode tense, aspect, mood, and voice. A verb may also agree with the person, gender or number of some of its arguments, such as its subject, or object. Verbs have tenses: present, to indicate that an action is being carried out; past, to indicate that an action has been done; future, to indicate that an action will be done. For some examples: I washed the car yesterday. The dog ate my homework. I will go to the store. John studies English and French. Lucy enjoys listening to music. Barack Obama became the President of the United States in 2009. (occurrence) Mike Trout is a center fielder. (state of being) "As far as we know, every language makes a grammatical distinction that looks like a noun verb distinction.". Possibly because of the graph-like nature of communicated meaning by humans, i.e. nouns being the "entities" and verbs being the "links" between them.
