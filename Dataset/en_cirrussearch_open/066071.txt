The Kūnaṛ River (Urdu: دریائے کونڑ; Pashto: د کونړ سيند; Khowar: کونڑ سيند), also known as the Chitral River (Urdu: دریائے چترال), Mastuj River (Pashto: مستوج سيند) and Kama River (Khowar: کامې سيند), is a 480 kilometres (300 mi) long river located in northern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan. It originates just south of the Broghil Pass, in the Upper Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. It later merges with Kabul river in the Nangahar Province of Afghanistan. The river system is fed by melting glaciers and snow of the Hindu Kush mountains. The Kunar River is a tributary of the Kabul river, which is in turn a tributary of the Indus River.
