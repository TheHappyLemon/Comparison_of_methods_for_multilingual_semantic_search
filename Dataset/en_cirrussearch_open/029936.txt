Real Sporting de Gijón, S.A.D. (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal esˈpoɾtin de xiˈxon]), commonly known as Real Sporting, Sporting Gijón, or simply Sporting (although in an international context this can lead to confusion with Sporting Clube de Portugal) is a Spanish football club from Gijón, Principality of Asturias. Founded on 1 July 1905, it plays in the Segunda Division. Known as Los Rojiblancos because of their red and white striped jerseys, their home ground is El Molinón stadium, the oldest professional football ground in Spain, in use since at least 1908. Traditionally their red and white shirts are accompanied by blue shorts with the socks recently also being blue. Its Asturian name is Real Sporting de Xixón. The most important milestones of the club were in the 1970s and 1980s, when it finished as runner-up of the 1978–79 La Liga and played two finals of the Copa del Rey in 1981 and 1982. Real Sporting is also one of only nine Spanish teams that have never played below the second division. Its local rivals are Real Oviedo from the neighbouring city slightly inland.
