The 2011 US Open was a tennis tournament played on the outdoor hard courts at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows Park, of Queens, New York City, United States. It began on August 29 and was originally scheduled to end on September 11, but the men's final was postponed to September 12 due to rain. Rafael Nadal and Kim Clijsters were the defending champions. Due to an abdominal muscle injury, Clijsters opted not to defend her title. In the women's singles, Australia's Samantha Stosur defeated Serena Williams in straight sets 6–2, 6–3 for her first Grand Slam title. Stosur thus became the first Australian female player to win a Grand Slam since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980. In the men's singles, both Nadal and Novak Djokovic played the final for the second consecutive year. This time, Djokovic won 6–2, 6–4, 6–7(3–7), 6–1 for his first US Open title.
