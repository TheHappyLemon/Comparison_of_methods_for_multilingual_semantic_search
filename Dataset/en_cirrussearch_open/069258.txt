The Johan Cruyff Shield (Dutch: Johan Cruijff Schaal, pronounced [ˌjoːɦɑŋ ˈkrœyf ˌsxaːl]) is a football trophy in the Netherlands named after Dutch footballer Johan Cruyff, also often referred to as the Dutch Super Cup. The winner is decided in one match only, played by the winner of the national football league, Eredivisie, and the winner of the national KNVB Cup. In the event of a team winning both the Eredivisie and the KNVB Cup, the Johan Cruyff Shield will be contested between that team and the runner up in the national league.
