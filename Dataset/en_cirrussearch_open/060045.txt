The Expendables 3 is a 2014 American action film directed by Patrick Hughes and written by Creighton Rothenberger, Katrin Benedikt and Sylvester Stallone. It is the third installment in The Expendables franchise and the sequel to The Expendables (2010) and The Expendables 2 (2012). The film features an ensemble cast of largely action film stars including Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham, Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren, Antonio Banderas, Wesley Snipes, Randy Couture, Jet Li, Ronda Rousey, Kelsey Grammer, Kellan Lutz, Glen Powell, Victor Ortiz, Harrison Ford, and Mel Gibson. The story follows the mercenary group known as The Expendables as they come into conflict with ruthless arms dealer Conrad Stonebanks, the Expendables' co-founder, who is determined to destroy the team. The film premiered in London on August 4, 2014 and was released theatrically on August 15, 2014, by Lionsgate. Unlike the first two films in the franchise, The Expendables 3 received a PG-13 rating instead of an R rating, which upset many fans of the franchise. Partly due to negative critical reviews and being leaked three weeks before its scheduled release, the film grossed $214.7 million worldwide on an estimated $90â€“100 million budget, becoming the lowest-grossing film of the franchise until the sequel, Expend4bles, was released on September 22, 2023.
