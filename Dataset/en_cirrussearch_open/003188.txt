The Estonian Reform Party (Estonian: Eesti Reformierakond) is a liberal political party in Estonia. The party has been led by Kaja Kallas since 2018. It is colloquially known as the "Squirrel Party" (Estonian: Oravapartei), referencing its logo. It was founded in 1994 by Siim Kallas, then-president of the Bank of Estonia, as a split from Pro Patria National Coalition Party. As the Reform Party has participated in most of the government coalitions in Estonia since the mid-1990s, its influence has been significant, especially regarding Estonia's free market and policies of low taxation. The party has been a full member of Liberal International since 1996, having been an observer member between 1994 and 1996, and a full member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). Reform Party leaders Siim Kallas, Taavi RÃµivas, Andrus Ansip and Kaja Kallas have all served as prime ministers of Estonia. From 17 April 2023, the party has been the senior member in a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party and Estonia 200.
