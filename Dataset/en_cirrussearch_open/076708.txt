The 2009 KHL Junior Draft was the first entry draft held by the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), taking place on June 1, 2009. Twenty-three teams would take part in the draft, selecting ice hockey players from around the world aged between 17 and 21 years of age. The draft acted as a means to disperse junior players among Russia, as well as create parity for recruiting from non-KHL affiliated hockey schools. Although the inaugural KHL season had 24 teams, Khimik Voskrensk was forced to drop out of league activities due to financial constrains. Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg filled this vacancy, however. HC MVD did not make a single selection in the draft, refusing to use any of their draft picks. Mikhail Pashnin, a defenceman from HC Mechel, was the first overall selection, chosen by CSKA Moscow.
