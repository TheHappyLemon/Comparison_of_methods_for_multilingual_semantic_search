The Supreme Commander–in–Chief (Supreme Commander) is the supreme commander of the armed forces of a state (or coalition of states), usually in wartime and sometimes in peacetime. The Supreme Commander–in–Chief is also vested with extraordinary power in relation to all civilian institutions and persons on the territory of a given state and the theater of military operations (theater of war). As a rule, the head of state is the Supreme Commander–in–Chief. For the first time, the corresponding English term was used by the king of England, Scotland and Ireland, Charles I (1625–1649). In some states of the British Commonwealth, this position is replaced by the Governor–General.
