Aloe tormentorii (previously Lomatophyllum tormentorii. Locally known as the "Mazambron") is a species of Aloe endemic to the island of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean. It is one of only two Aloes to naturally occur in Mauritius - the other being the tall growing Aloe purpurea. It is part of a group of aloes which bear fleshy berries, and were therefore classed as a separate group, "Lomatophyllum". Within this group, it is closely related to Madagascan Aloe occidentalis (which can be distinguished by having longer leaves, shorter inflorescence, and longer perianths, than Aloe tormentorii).
