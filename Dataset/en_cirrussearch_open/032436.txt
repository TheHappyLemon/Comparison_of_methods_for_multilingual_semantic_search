The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Guinea accepted the convention, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Guinea has only one World Heritage Site, Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve, which it's shared with the neighbouring country of Ivory Coast.
