The Ninth Wave (Russian: Девятый вал, Dyevyatiy val) is an 1850 painting by Russian-Armenian marine painter Ivan Aivazovsky. It is his best-known work. The title refers to an old sailing expression referring to a wave of incredible size that comes after a succession of incrementally larger waves. It depicts a sea after a night storm and people facing death attempting to save themselves by clinging to debris from a wrecked ship. The debris, in the shape of the cross, appears to be a Christian metaphor for salvation from the earthly sin. The painting has warm tones, which reduce the sea's apparent menacing overtones and a chance for the people to survive seems plausible. This painting shows both the destructiveness and beauty of nature.[citation needed]
