The Dow Chemical Company is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Midland, Michigan, United States. The company is among the three largest chemical producers in the world. It is the operating subsidiary of Dow Inc., a publicly traded holding company incorporated under Delaware law. The company owns (now defunct) Union Carbide, which was embroiled in a cover-up of a toxic gas leak involving the deaths of tens of thousands of people in Bhopal. With a presence in around 160 countries, it employs about 36,000 people worldwide. Dow has been called the "chemical companies' chemical company", as its sales are to other industries rather than directly to end-use consumers. Dow is a member of the American Chemistry Council. In 2015, Dow and fellow chemical company DuPont agreed to a corporate reorganization involving the merger of Dow and DuPont followed by a separation into three different entities. The plan commenced in 2017, when Dow and DuPont merged to form DowDuPont, and was finalized in April 2019, when the materials science division was spun off from DowDuPont and took the name of the Dow Chemical Company.
