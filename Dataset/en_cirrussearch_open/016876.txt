The 1949 FIBA European Championship, commonly called FIBA EuroBasket 1949, was the sixth FIBA EuroBasket regional basketball championship, held by FIBA. Seven national teams affiliated with the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) took part in the competition. The competition was hosted by Egypt after the Soviet Union refused to host it, as was the Soviet's obligation as defending champion under FIBA Europe rules. Czechoslovakia, the silver medallist at EuroBasket 1947, had been the host that year, so was not asked to repeat hosting duties and those duties fell to bronze medallist Egypt. The event took place in Cairo, with travel difficulties cited by many nations as the reason for not competing. Only four of the seven competing teams were European.
