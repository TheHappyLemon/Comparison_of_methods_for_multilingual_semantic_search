Theria (/ˈθɪəriə/ or /ˈθɛriə/; from Ancient Greek θηρίον (thēríon) 'wild beast') is a subclass of mammals amongst the Theriiformes. Theria includes the eutherians (including the placental mammals) and the metatherians (including the marsupials) but excludes the egg-laying monotremes and various extinct mammals evolving prior to the common ancestor of placentals and marsupials.
