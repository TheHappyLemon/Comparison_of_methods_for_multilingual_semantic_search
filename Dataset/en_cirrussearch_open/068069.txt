A Good Year is a 2006 romantic comedy-drama film directed and produced by Ridley Scott. The film stars Russell Crowe, Marion Cotillard, Didier Bourdon, Abbie Cornish, Tom Hollander, Freddie Highmore and Albert Finney. The film is loosely based on the 2004 novel of the same name by British author Peter Mayle. The film was theatrically released in the United States on November 10, 2006 by 20th Century Fox. It was a box office bomb, grossing $42 million against its $35 million budget and resulting in a $20 million loss for the studio, but it received nominations for the Critics Choice Award for Best Young Actor and the Satellite Award for Best Cinematography.
