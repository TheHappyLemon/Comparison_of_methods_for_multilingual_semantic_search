The Northern Ireland women's national football team represents Northern Ireland in international women's football. Although most national football teams represent a sovereign state, FIFA statutes permit Northern Ireland as a member of the United Kingdom's Home Nations to maintain its own national side that competes in all major tournaments, with the exception of the Women's Olympic Football Tournament. The team were the lowest UEFA-ranked team (27th) to qualify for the European Championships Finals in England in 2022. In September 2021 it was announced that the senior women's team would be adopting a full-time professional set up ahead of Euro 2022.
