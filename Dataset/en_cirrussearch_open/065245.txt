Namak Lake (Persian: دریاچه نمک, romanized: Daryâče-ye Namak, i.e., salt lake) is a salt lake in Iran. It is located approximately 100 km (62 mi) east of the city of Qom and 60 km (37 mi) of Kashan at an elevation of 790 metres (2,590 ft) above sea level. The lake is a remnant of the Paratethys sea, which started to dry up from the Pleistocene epoch, leaving Lake Urmia and the Caspian Sea and other bodies of water. The lake has a surface area of about 1,800 km2 (690 sq mi), but most of this is dry. Water only covers 1 km2 (0.4 sq mi). The lake only reaches a depth between 45 centimetres (17.72 in) to 1 metre (39.37 in).
