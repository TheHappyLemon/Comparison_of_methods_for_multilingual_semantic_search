The Netherlands has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 63 times since making its debut as one of the seven countries at the first contest in 1956. The country has missed only four contests, twice because the dates coincided with Remembrance of the Dead (1985, 1991) and twice because of being relegated due to poor results the previous year (1995 and 2002). The Netherlands hosted the contest in Hilversum (1958), Amsterdam (1970), twice in The Hague (1976 and 1980) and Rotterdam (2021). The Netherlands has won the contest five times, with Corry Brokken (1957), Teddy Scholten (1959), Lenny Kuhr in a four-way tie (1969), Teach-In (1975) and Duncan Laurence (2019). The country's other top five results are Sandra and Andres fourth (1972), Mouth and MacNeal third (1974), Maggie MacNeal fifth (1980), Marcha fifth (1987), Edsilia Rombley fourth (1998), and second with The Common Linnets (2014). It has finished last in 1958, 1962, 1963, 1968, and in the second semi-final in 2011. After the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, the Netherlands failed to reach the final for eight years in a row from 2005 to 2012, but has since reached eight of the last ten finals.
