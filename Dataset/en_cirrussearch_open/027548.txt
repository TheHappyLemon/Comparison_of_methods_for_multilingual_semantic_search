In music, in English sharp – eqv. dièse (from French) or diesis (from Greek δίεσις) – means higher in pitch. The sharp symbol, ♯, indicates that the note to which the symbol is applied is played one chromatic semitone higher (not to be confused with the diatonic semitone, which - in the 12 tone equal temperament - its enharmonic with). The opposite of sharp is flat, indicating a lowering of pitch. The ♯ symbol derives from a square form of the letter b (see History of notation of accidentals for more information).
