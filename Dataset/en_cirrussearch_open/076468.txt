In geometry, Heron's formula (or Hero's formula) gives the area of a triangle in terms of the three side lengths a,{\displaystyle a,} b,{\displaystyle b,} c.{\displaystyle c.} Letting s{\displaystyle s} be the semiperimeter of the triangle, s=12(a+b+c),{\displaystyle s={\tfrac {1}{2}}(a+b+c),} the area A{\displaystyle A} is A=s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c).{\displaystyle A={\sqrt {s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}.} It is named after first-century engineer Heron of Alexandria (or Hero) who proved it in his work Metrica, though it was probably known centuries earlier.
