The Mindanao Sea lies to the southwest. Panaon is about 30 kilometres (19Â mi) long from north to south. The largest town is Liloan, which is connected by a bridge called the Wawa Bridge to the main Leyte Island. Panaon Island is composed of the municipalities of Liloan, San Francisco, Pintuyan and San Ricardo. The basic forms of living are harvesting coconut, rice, fish and edible green leaves. Scuba diving and whale watching (referred to locally as Tikitiki) are popular tourist activities.
