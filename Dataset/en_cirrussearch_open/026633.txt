Berom or Birom (Cèn Bèrom) is the most widely spoken Plateau language in Nigeria. The language is locally numerically important and is consistently spoken by Berom of all ages in rural areas. However, the Berom are shifting to Hausa in cities. The small Cen and Nincut dialects may be separate languages. Approximately 1 million (2010) people speak in this language. Berom is spoken in a large area extending from some precolonial settlements embedded within the Jos metropolitan area to the south of Jos city to Barkin Ladi and Riyom in Plateau State, Nigeria. The Berom population distribution culminates at the edge of the Jos plateau in Sopp chiefdom of Riyom Local Government Area.
