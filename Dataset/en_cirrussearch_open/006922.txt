"Start All Over" is a song recorded by American singer Miley Cyrus for her debut studio album Meet Miley Cyrus (2007). The song was written by Fefe Dobson, Anne Preven and produced by Annetenna. It was released by Hollywood Records on March 11, 2008, as the second single from the album only in Australia. An accompanying music video, directed by Marc Webb was also released. A live version is available on Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert and as an instrumental in Cyrus's karaoke series. The song was originally recorded by Fefe Dobson, who passed the song to Cyrus, because she did not desire to include it on Sunday Love. The uptempo song is lyrically about having a second chance in a romantic relationship. The song reached its highest international peak in Australia at 41 and also charted in Canada and the United States at 68 and 91 respectively. The song was also certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping over 500,000 copies. Cyrus performed the song in 2007 and 2008 the Best of Both Worlds Tour, as the opening number for her performances as herself. Cyrus again performed "Start All Over" once she embarked on the 2009 Wonder World Tour.
