União Desportiva Vilafranquense was a Portuguese football club from Vila Franca de Xira, Lisbon District. At the time of closure in 2023, it competed in Liga Portugal 2, the second tier of the Portuguese football league system, following its promotion in 2019. The club relocated to Vila das Aves after the 2022-23 Liga Portugal 2, rebranding itself as AVS Futebol SAD and adopting the defunct Desportivo das Aves's facilities and colours. The other only time when the club had played in the second tier was in 1987–88 season, when that level was still regionalised.
