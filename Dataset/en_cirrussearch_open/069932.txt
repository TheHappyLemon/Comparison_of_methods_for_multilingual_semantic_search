Ke Huy Quan (born August 20, 1971), also known as Jonathan Ke Quan (/kiːˈkwɑːn/), is an American actor. As a child actor, Quan rose to fame playing Short Round in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) and Data in The Goonies (1985). Following a few roles in the 1990s, he took a 19-year acting hiatus, during which he worked as a stunt choreographer and assistant director. Quan returned to acting with the family adventure Finding ʻOhana (2021), followed by the critically acclaimed Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022), a performance that won him various accolades, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Quan and Haing S. Ngor are the only two actors of Asian descent to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and Quan is the first Vietnam-born actor to win an Academy Award. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2023. He has since starred in the second season of the Disney+ series Loki in 2023.
