Rubroboletus satanas, commonly known as Satan's bolete or the Devil's bolete, is a basidiomycete fungus of the bolete family (Boletaceae) and one of its most infamous members. It was known as Boletus satanas before its transfer to the new genus Rubroboletus in 2014, based on molecular phylogenetic data. Found in broad-leaved and mixed woodland in the warmer regions of Europe, it is classified as a poisonous mushroom, known to cause gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea and violent vomiting. However, reports of poisoning are rare, due to its striking appearance and at times putrid smell, which discourage casual experimentation. The squat, brightly coloured fruiting bodies are often massive and imposing, with a pale, dull-coloured velvety cap up to 30 cm (12 in), extraordinarily 40 cm (16 in), very rarely 50 cm (20 in) across, yellow to orange-red pores and a bulbous red-patterned stem. The flesh turns blue when cut or bruised, and overripe fruit bodies often emit an unpleasant smell reminiscent of carrion. It is arguably the largest bolete found in Europe.
