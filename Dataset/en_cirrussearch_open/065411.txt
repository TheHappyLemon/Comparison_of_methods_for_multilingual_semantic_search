Club Atlético Platense is an Argentine sports club based in Florida, Buenos Aires. The club nickname is Calamar (Squid) after the journalist Palacio Zino said that the team moved "like a squid in its ink". Although the club hosts many activities, Platense is mostly known for its football team. Despite being relegated from the Primera División in 1999, it remains on the top 20 of the All-time Argentine Primera División table. Since 2021, Platense again currently competes in the Argentine Primera División, the top division of the Argentine league system. The team was recently promoted after beating Estudiantes de Río Cuarto in the "Torneo Reducido" final.
