Apayao, officially the Province of Apayao (Ilocano: Probinsia ti Apayao; Itawit: Provinsiya ya Apayao; Isnag: Provinsia nga Apayao; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Apayao), is a landlocked province in the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. Kabugao serves as its capital. The provincial capitol and its associated offices are located at the New Government Center in Luna. The province borders Cagayan to the north and east, Abra and Ilocos Norte to the west, and Kalinga to the south. Prior to 1995, Kalinga and Apayao comprised a single province named Kalinga-Apayao, which was partitioned to better service the needs of individual ethnic groups. With a population of 124,366 (as of the 2020 census) covering an area of 4,413.35 square kilometres (1,704.00 sq mi), Apayao is the least densely-populated province in the Philippines, the least developed province in Luzon and one of the poorest.
