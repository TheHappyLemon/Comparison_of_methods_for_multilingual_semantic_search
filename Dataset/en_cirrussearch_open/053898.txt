Roberto Soldado Rillo (Spanish pronunciation: [roˈβeɾto solˈdaðo ˈriʎo]; born 27 May 1985) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a striker. After emerging through Real Madrid's youth system, he went on to appear in only 27 official matches for the first team (four goals). However, he became a more regular La Liga player and goalscorer for Osasuna, Getafe and Valencia, and secured a £26 million move to Tottenham Hotspur. After two unsuccessful seasons in England, he returned to the Spanish top division with Villarreal. An international since 2007, Soldado represented Spain at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.
