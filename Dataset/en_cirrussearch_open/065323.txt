Rockstar Leeds Limited (formerly Möbius Entertainment Limited) is a British video game developer and a studio of Rockstar Games based in Leeds. Ian J. Bowden, Dave Box, Gordon Hall, and Jason McGann founded the company as Möbius Entertainment in December 1997 after working together at the studio Hookstone. Möbius worked with SCi on two games: Alfred's Adventure, a remake of the Twilight-developed Alfred Chicken, and the cancelled Titanium Angels. From 2001 on, the studio created Game Boy Advance games for several publishers, including multiple for The 3DO Company and Max Payne for Rockstar Games. By the time the PlayStation Portable was announced, Möbius had developed a game engine that targeted similar technical specifications. This attracted several parties interested in buying the studio, including Rockstar Games. The publisher's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, acquired Möbius in March 2004, and the studio became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar Leeds. Thereafter, the studio created several PlayStation Portable games, including the original games Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, and Beaterator, as well as ports of Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition, The Warriors, and Manhunt 2. Since 2007, several employees (including Bowden, Hall, and McGann) have left Rockstar Leeds to take sabbaticals, establish studios, or join other companies.
