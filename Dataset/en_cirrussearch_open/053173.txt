The Bălți Steppe (Romanian: Stepa Bălțului) is a hilly area with few trees (apart from those near rivers Dniestr, Răut and numerous lakes and creeks), dominated by agriculturally cultivated land, and occasionally by grasses and shrubs, in the northern part of Moldova. It is characterised by moderate but unstable seasons, generally hot summers and cold winters. The Bălți Steppe has a total surface of 1,920 km2, 2.7 per cent (51 km2) of it are forests. The region, as the rest of Moldova, is traditionally an agricultural area, favored by several factors, such as the chernozem (black earth). The untouched natural richness of the northern Moldavian region became known as Bălți steppe only in the beginning of the last century.
