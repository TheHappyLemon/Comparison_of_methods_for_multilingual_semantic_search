Andrei Anatolyevich Mikhnevich (Belarusian: Андрэй Анатолевіч Міхневіч, Andrej Michnievič, Russian: Андрей Анатольевич Михневич; born 12 July 1976 in Babruysk) is a Belarusian shot putter with a personal best of 21.69 metres, set in 2003. In 2013 he was banned from sports for life due to his second doping positive. He started competing at global championships in 1999 and attended the 2000 Summer Olympics, but he was banned for a doping offence in 2001. He returned after a two-year suspension and promptly became the shot put world champion at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics. He took part in the 2004 Athens Olympics and the 2005 World Championships but failed to reach the global podium over this period. He had a resurgence of form in 2006, taking silver at the IAAF World Indoor Championships as well as silver at the 2006 European Athletics Championships. He won the bronze at the 2007 World Championships and took his first Olympic honour, another bronze medal, at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He won indoor world silver for a second time at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships and the gold medal at the 2010 European Championships in Barcelona. In 2012 IAAF retested doping samples from the 2005 World Athletics Championships and Mikhnevich was found positive for 3 anabolic steroids: Clenbuterol, Methandienone and Oxandrolone. He was subsequently banned from sports for life, and the results from 6 August 2005 onwards were annulled. He lost the silver medals from the World Indoor Championships in 2006 and 2010, and the bronze medals from the 2007 and 2011 IAAF World Championships. In August 2014 IOC also disqualified his results from the 2008 Summer Olympics and re-allocated the bronze medal.
