The Smallwood Reservoir is the reservoir created for the Churchill Falls Generating Station in the western part of Labrador, Canada. Unlike other reservoirs, water is contained not by a single large dam, but by a series of 88 dikes that total 64 km (40 mi) in length in the drainage area of the Churchill River. It is named in honour of Joey Smallwood, the first premier of Newfoundland. With an area of 6,527 km2 (2,520 sq mi), is the largest body of freshwater in the province and the second-largest reservoir in the world in terms of surface area.
