One-X is the second studio album by Canadian rock band Three Days Grace, released on June 13, 2006 as their sole album under Sony BMG, the successor to Sony Music Entertainment's original roots and Bertelsmann Music Group. The Sony BMG joint venture was dropped in 2008, which led to Bertelsmann's Sony BMG stake going back to Sony. Produced by Howard Benson, it is the band's first album recorded as a quartet, as Barry Stock joined the group and took over lead guitar from lead singer Adam Gontier. One-X was both critically and commercially successful, being certified silver in the United Kingdom and triple-platinum in both the U.S. and Canada and becoming the band's most successful album in terms of sales internationally.
