In the film, a man is accused of killing a wealthy widow who had named him as the main beneficiary in her will. The accused person's wife testifies against him, but her testimony is undermined by handwritten letters which supposedly prove that she had conspired against her husband. Following the trial, the wife admits that she had forged the letters to discredit her own testimony and to ensure the acquittal of her husband.
