Connah's Quay Nomads Football Club (Welsh: Clwb Pêl-droed Cei Connah) is a Welsh professional football club based in Connah's Quay, Flintshire. They play in the Cymru Premier. The club was founded in 1946 as Connah's Quay Juniors and adopted the Connah's Quay Nomads F.C. name in 1951. From 2008 to 2017, naming rights were controlled by Gap Personnel, a recruitment firm, and the club was consequently known as Gap Connah's Quay. The club's home ground is at Cae y Castell in Flint, and accommodates 1,000 spectators. For the 2006–07 season, they temporarily played their home games in Flint due to drainage problems with the Deeside Stadium pitch. In April 2013, the club announced that starting with the 2013–14 season, they would be using an all red home kit, accompanied by an all yellow away kit to complement the new logo which includes the traditional colours used in the Connah's Quay Town crest. On 2 March 2023 it was announced that from the 2023–24 season, they will play their home games in Flint due to behind the scenes tenancy problems with the owners of the Deeside Stadium.
