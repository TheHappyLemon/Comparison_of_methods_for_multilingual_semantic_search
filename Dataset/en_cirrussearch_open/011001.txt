Peter Bondra (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈpeter ˈbɔndra]; born 7 February 1968) is a Ukrainian-born Slovak former professional ice hockey player. He was the general manager of the Slovakia national team from 2007 to 2011. A two-time 50-goal scorer, Bondra became the 37th player in National Hockey League (NHL) history to score 500 NHL goals; he is one of five eligible 500-goal players not currently in the Hockey Hall of Fame. He has the fewest points among all players who reached that milestone, with 892, making him one of only two (with Maurice Richard) 500-goal scorers not on the list of NHL players with 1,000 points. Bondra scored the most goals in the NHL in two seasons, 1994–95 and 1997–98. He is one of the few players who scored five or more goals in one NHL game. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2016.
