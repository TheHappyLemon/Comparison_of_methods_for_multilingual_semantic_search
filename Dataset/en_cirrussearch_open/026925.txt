"Naḥnu Jund Allāh Jund al-Waṭan" (Arabic: نحن جند الله جند الوطن; English: "We are Soldiers of God, Soldiers of the Homeland") is the national anthem of Sudan. The words were written by the poet Ahmed Mohammed Saleh and the tune was composed by Ahmed Morjan in 1955. It is officially called the Republican Salute (especially when played musically), as it is called for short, the Flag Anthem or Flag Salute.
