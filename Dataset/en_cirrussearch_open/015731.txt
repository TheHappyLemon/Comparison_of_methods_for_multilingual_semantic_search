Tuukka Mikael Rask (born 10 March 1987) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey goaltender. Rask was drafted 21st overall in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft by the Toronto Maple Leafs before being traded to the Boston Bruins in 2006, where he played his entire 15 season NHL career. Rask was consistently successful during his tenure with the Bruins. After winning the Stanley Cup as a backup with the Bruins in 2011, he led the Bruins to the Stanley Cup Finals on two occasions in 2013 and 2019. He also won the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goaltender during the 2013–14 season, and was a finalist for the 2019–20 award. He also won the William M. Jennings Trophy along with goaltender Jaroslav Halák in the 2019–20 season. Rask is also a two-time NHL All-Star team member. Internationally, he led team Finland to a bronze medal over team USA at the 2006 World Juniors, where he was also awarded the honor of Best Goaltender. He led them to another bronze medal against the United States at the 2014 Winter Olympics. Tuukka is the older brother of Joonas Rask, who plays professionally as a forward with Luleå HF in the SHL. Tuukka Rask holds the Boston Bruins record for regular season games played (564) and wins (308), as well as the playoff record for games played (104) and wins (57). Among goaltenders with at least 250 games played, Rask is fourth in save percentage all-time (0.92103), third in goals against average (GAA) among goaltenders in the modern era (2.28), and eighteenth in goals saved above average (GSAA) all time (149.934). In the playoffs (min 15 games), Rask is eleventh in save percentage (0.92517) and sixteenth in GAA (2.22). Rask also holds the NHL record for most consecutive playoff games above the 0.900 save percentage mark, eclipsing 23 games during the 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs. He is the only goaltender in modern NHL history to have not lost a Conference finals game playing at least two series, posting an 8–0 record with 3 shutouts, a GAA of 0.82, and a save percentage of 0.972 in those Conference Finals games. He finished his career 3-3 in game 7s. Tuukka Rask was considered to be a true hybrid goaltender known for his economy of motion. He was best known for playing a very positionally sound game, where he would absorb the puck into his chest rather than reaching for it with his hands. He employed a narrow butterfly and he stayed on his skates to make high saves, rather than dropping to his knees. His style incorporates a low and wide stance, a unique shin-lock RVH positioning, and effective rebound control. The shin-lock RVH (reverse vertical-horizontal), which was a staple in his game during his early seasons as well as later in his career eventually caused him hip issues and ultimately ended his career after an attempted comeback in 2022.
