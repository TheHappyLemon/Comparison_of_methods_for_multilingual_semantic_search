A limousine (/ˈlɪməziːn/ or /lɪməˈziːn/), or limo (/ˈlɪmoʊ/) for short, is a large, chauffeur-driven luxury vehicle with a partition between the driver compartment and the passenger compartment which can be operated mechanically by hand or by a button electronically. A luxury sedan with a very long wheelbase and driven by a professional driver is called a stretch limousine. In some countries, such as the United States, Germany, Canada, and Australia, a limousine service may be any pre-booked hire car with a driver, usually, but only sometimes a luxury car. In particular, airport shuttle services are often called "limousine services", though they often use minivans, light commercial vehicles, or MPVs.
