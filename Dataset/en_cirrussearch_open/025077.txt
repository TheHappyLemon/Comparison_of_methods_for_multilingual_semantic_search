This is a list of monarchs of Spain, a dominion started with the dynastic union of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain— Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. The regnal numbers follow those of the rulers of Asturias, León, and Castile. Thus, Alfonso XII is numbered in succession to Alfonso XI of Castile.
