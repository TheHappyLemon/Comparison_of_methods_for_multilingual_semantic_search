German euro coins have three separate designs for the three series of coins. The 1-cent, 2-cent and 5-cent coins were designed by Rolf Lederbogen [de], the design for the 10-cent, 20-cent and 50-cent coins were designed by Reinhard Heinsdorff [de] and the 1- and 2-euro coins were done by Heinz Hoyer [de] and Sneschana Russewa-Hoyer. Featured in all designs are the 12 stars of the EU and the year of minting. In addition to the year, the German coins also feature a small letter as a mint mark indicating the particular mint that minted the coin. A: Berlin D: Munich F: Stuttgart G: Karlsruhe J: Hamburg The letters were assigned to the mints as they opened. The mints in Hannover/Vienna (B), Frankfurt am Main (C), and Darmstadt (H) were closed by 1882. After the German separation, D, F, G and J minted coins for the Federal Republic of Germany, while the German Democratic Republic used Berlin (A) and Dresden/Muldenhütte (E) until it closed 1953. Berlin (A) started minting D Mark coins in 1990.
