Tyumen (/t.juːˈmɛn/ tyoo-MEN; Russian: Тюмень, IPA: [tʲʉˈmʲenʲ] ) (Siberian Tatar: Цимке-тора) is the administrative center and largest city of Tyumen Oblast, Russia. It is situated just east of the Ural Mountains, along the Tura River. Fueled by the Russian oil and gas industry, Tyumen has experienced rapid population growth in recent years, rising to a population of 847,488 at the 2021 Census. Tyumen is among the largest cities of the Ural region and the Ural Federal District. Tyumen is often regarded as the first Siberian city, from the western direction. Tyumen was the first Russian settlement in Siberia. Founded in 1586 to support Russia's eastward expansion, the city has remained one of the most important industrial and economic centers east of the Ural Mountains. Located at the junction of several important trade routes and with easy access to navigable waterways, Tyumen rapidly developed from a small military settlement to a large commercial and industrial city. The central part of Old Tyumen retains many historic buildings from throughout the city's history. Today, Tyumen is an important business center. It is the transport hub and industrial center of Tyumen Oblast – an oil-rich region bordering Kazakhstan – as well as the home of many companies active in Russia's oil and gas industry.
