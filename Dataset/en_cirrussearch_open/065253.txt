The 47th FIS Alpine World Ski Championships took place from 6 to 19 February 2023 in two neighboring locations in the French Alps, Courchevel and Méribel. The location was decided in May 2018 during the 51st FIS Congress in Costa Navarino (Greece), where Courchevel-Méribel won against Austrian Saalbach-Hinterglemm with 9 to 6 votes. The same two towns already hosted parts of the 1992 Winter Olympic Games. In Courchevel, ski jumping and the Nordic combination took place, and Méribel was the location for the women's alpine skiing.
