Latvia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 with the song "Cake to Bake" written by Guntis Veilands. The song was performed by the band Aarzemnieki. The Latvian broadcaster Latvijas TelevÄ«zija (LTV) organised the national final Dziesma 2014 in order to select the Latvian entry for the 2014 contest in Copenhagen, Denmark. Twenty-four songs were selected to compete in the national final, which consisted of three shows: two semi-finals and a final. In the semi-finals on 1 and 2 February 2014, six entries were selected to advance from each show. Twelve songs ultimately qualified to compete in the final on 22 February 2014 where two rounds of voting by a public televote and a nine-member jury panel selected "Cake to Bake" performed by Aarzemnieki as the winner. Latvia was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 6 May 2014. Performing during the show in position 2, "Cake to Bake" was not announced among the top 10 entries of the first semi-final and therefore did not qualify to compete in the final. It was later revealed that Latvia placed thirteenth out of the 16 participating countries in the semi-final with 33 points.
