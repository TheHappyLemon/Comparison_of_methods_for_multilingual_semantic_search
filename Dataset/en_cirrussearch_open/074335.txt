The Brotherhood of Blackheads (German: Bruderschaft der Schwarzhäupter; Estonian: Mustpeade vennaskond; Latvian: Melngalvju brālības) is an association of local unmarried male merchants, ship-owners, and foreigners that was active in Livonia (present-day Estonia and Latvia) from the mid-14th century till 1940 but still remains active in present-day Hamburg. The Brotherhood of Blackheads originated as a military organization, but the non-military aspects of the association gradually became more pronounced until the Brotherhood became a predominantly social organization after the end (1721) of the Great Northern War.
