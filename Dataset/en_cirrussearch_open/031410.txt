The administrative divisions of Brunei mainly consist of daerah (districts), mukim (subdistricts) and kampung or kampong (villages). They are organised hierarchically, with daerah being the first level and kampong the third level. There are also a few municipal divisions: Bandar Seri Begawan and a few district towns. They are considered to be outside the hierarchy of the main administrative division. All the administrative divisions are under direct governance of the government through the Ministry of Home Affairs. Generally, the administrative divisions serve for population census. The administrative areas have limited to no autonomy, and is more pronounced towards the lowest administrative level. The major socio-political aspects such as education and law are centralised and managed through separate government ministries or departments.
