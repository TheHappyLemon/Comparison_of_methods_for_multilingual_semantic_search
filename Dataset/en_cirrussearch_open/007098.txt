.pf is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for French Polynesia. The name pf derived from the French name of Polynésie française. A local contact has to be appointed to register a domain name under .pf. The only 2nd level domain available for public registrations at the third level is .org.pf, but most registrations are made directly at the second level.
