The 2020–21 Serie A (known as the Serie A TIM for sponsorship reasons) was the 119th season of top-tier Italian football, the 89th in a round-robin tournament, and the 11th since its organization under an own league committee, the Lega Serie A. Following Atalanta's draw with Sassuolo on 2 May 2021, Internazionale were confirmed as champions for the first time since the 2009–10 Serie A, ending Juventus' run of nine consecutive titles.
