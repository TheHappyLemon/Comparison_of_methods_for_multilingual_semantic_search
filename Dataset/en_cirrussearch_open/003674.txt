For a Good Latvia (Latvian: Par Labu Latviju!, also known as (AŠ)²) was a Latvian right-wing party alliance founded on 22 April 2010 by the People's Party, Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way, the businessmen's movement For a Good Latvia and some smaller parties. The initial name (AŠ)² referred to the initials of the party leaders of the People's Party (Andris Šķēle) and LPP/LC (Ainārs Šlesers). Both major parties participating had been doing badly in the polls. The alliance was headed by former Latvian president Guntis Ulmanis. In the 2010 parliamentary election it won a disappointing 8 seats and did not join the governing coalition. In July 2011 the People's Party was dissolved and Ainārs Šlesers' LPP/LC renamed itself the Ainars Šlesers LPP/LC Reform Party, by analogy with the Zatlers' Reform Party. The parliamentary faction of "For a Good Latvia", however, continued to exist until the end of the 10th Saeima and was headed by Edgars Zalāns. In the elections of September 2011, Ainars Šlesers LPP/LC Reform Party failed to win any seats.
