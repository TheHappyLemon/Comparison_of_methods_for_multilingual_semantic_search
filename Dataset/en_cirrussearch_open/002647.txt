The FIBA AmeriCup (previously known as the FIBA Americas Championship) is the Americas Basketball Championship that takes place every four years between national teams of the Western Hemisphere continents. Since FIBA organized the entire Western Hemisphere west of the Atlantic Ocean under one zone, countries from North America, Central America, the Caribbean and South America compete in this tournament. Through the 2015 edition, the Americas Championship took place every two years, and was also a qualifying tournament for the FIBA World Cup and the Summer Olympic Games. However, since 2017, the AmeriCup, along with all other FIBA continental championships for men are played once every four years. The continental championships are no longer a part of the qualifying process for either the World Cup or Olympics.
