Australia has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest eight times since its debut in 2015, the second country outside of the Eurasia region to take part in the contest after Morocco in 1980. The country has been in the top ten five times, with their best result being a second-place finish for Dami Im in 2016, followed by Guy Sebastian finishing fifth in 2015 and Isaiah, Kate Miller-Heidke and Voyager finishing ninth in 2017, 2019 and 2023 respectively. Initially, Australia's participation in the 2015 contest was set to be a one-off event, the plan being only to perform again the following year had it won, but it was confirmed in November 2015 by SVT that it would participate in the 2016 contest, and the country has participated every year since. The contest attracts a significantly high viewership for SBS, and has a broad and active national fanbase. Due to time differences with the European host cities, the event typically airs at 05:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST). The contest receives widespread mainstream media coverage in the country, and also enjoys a cult following amongst dedicated fans each year.
