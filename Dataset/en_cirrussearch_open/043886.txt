Mattia Perin (Italian pronunciation: [matˈtiːa peˈrin]; born 10 November 1992) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Serie A club Juventus. Perin began his career with Genoa in 2010, and, aside from two season-long loan spells with Padova in 2011–12, and Pescara in 2012–13, he then remained there until the summer of 2018, during which he was sold to Juventus. He won the league title with the club during the 2018–19 season, although he primarily served as a back-up. At international level, he was an unused member of the Italy national team that took part at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and made his senior debut later that year.
