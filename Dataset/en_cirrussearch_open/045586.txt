Oskar Emil von Hutier (27 August 1857 â€“ 5 December 1934) was a German general during the First World War. He served in the German Army from 1875 to 1919, including war service. During the First World War, he commanded the army that took Riga in 1917. The following year he was transferred to the Western Front to participate in Operation Michael that year. He is frequently but mistakenly credited with having created the stormtrooper tactics of small, rapid forces, which he employed to great effect during the Michael offensive. These tactics had been developed by other officers on the Western Front before he was reassigned there. After retiring from the Army in 1919, Hutier presided over the German Officers' League until his death on 5 December 1934. He was among leaders who contended that the Army had been betrayed by enemies at home.
