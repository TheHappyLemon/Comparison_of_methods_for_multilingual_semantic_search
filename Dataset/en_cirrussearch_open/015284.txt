The Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec is a one-day professional bicycle road race held in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Its first edition was on September 10, 2010, as the penultimate event in the 2010 UCI ProTour. The Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec and the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal held two days later are collectively known as the "Laurentian Classics"[citation needed]. Australian cyclist Simon Gerrans was the first to achieve a Laurentian double by winning both races in the same year in 2014. Fellow Australian cyclist Michael Matthews also achieved this double in 2018.
