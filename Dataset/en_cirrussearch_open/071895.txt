Ruslan Oleksiyovych Stefanchuk (Ukrainian: Руслан Олексійович Стефанчук; born 29 October 1975) is a Ukrainian politician, lawyer and Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (since October 2021). Stefanchuk was touted as the ideologue of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s election campaign in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election. He was elected to the Ukrainian parliament as a member of the Servant of the People party (placed 2nd on the party list) in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election. On the morning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Stefanchuk was rushed to the Mariinskyi Palace, amid reports of assassination attempts on Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as his role meant he would have to take command of the country had the president been killed.
