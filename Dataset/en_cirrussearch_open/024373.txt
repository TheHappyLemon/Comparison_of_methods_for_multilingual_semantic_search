Chyhyryn (Ukrainian: Чигирин, pronounced [tʃɪɦɪˈrɪn]; Polish: Czehryń, pronounced [ˈt͡ʂɛ.xrɨɲ]) is a city in Cherkasy Raion, Cherkasy Oblast, central Ukraine. It is located on Tiasmyn river not far where it enters Dnieper. From 1648 to 1669, the city served as the residence of the hetman of the Zaporizhian Host. After a forced relocation of the Ruthenian Orthodox metropolitan see from Kyiv in 1658, it became a full-fledged capital of the Cossack Hetmanate. Among Metropolitans who served out of Chyhyryn were family of Tukalsky: Dionysius Balaban-Tukalskyi and Joseph Tukalskyi-Nelyubovych. Chyhyryn also became a traditional place for the appointment to the office of the hetman of the Zaporizhian Host. Since the 17th century, the significance of the settlement was diminished to a semi-rural populated place. It hosts the administration of Chyhyryn urban hromada [uk], one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 8,539 (2022 estimate).
