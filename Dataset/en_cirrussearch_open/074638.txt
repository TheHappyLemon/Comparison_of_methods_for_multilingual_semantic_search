Atlantropa, also referred to as Panropa, was a gigantic engineering and colonisation idea that German architect Herman SÃ¶rgel devised in the 1920s, and promoted until his death in 1952. The project was devised to contain several hydroelectric dams in key points of the Mediterranean Sea, such as the Strait of Gibraltar and the Bosporus, to cause a sea level drop and create new land to settle.
