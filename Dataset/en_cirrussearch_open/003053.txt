Riga District (Latvian: Rīgas rajons) was an administrative division of Latvia, located in Semigallia and Vidzeme regions, in the centre of the country. It was the de facto successor of the historical Riga County since 1949. Beginning from the west and counterclockwise to the east, Riga District bordered the districts of Tukums, Jelgava, Bauska, Ogre, Cēsis and Limbaži. The area of the district was 3,058 km² with a population of 159,247 in January 2009. Riga District was one of the largest regions of Latvia, it was strategically important and also had some of the most developed infrastructure in Latvia. It was a cross-point of 10 major motorways and a junction of 6 important railroad lines. Districts were eliminated during the administrative-territorial reform in 2009.
