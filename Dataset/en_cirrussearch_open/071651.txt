Alvin Nathaniel Joiner (born September 18, 1974), better known by his stage name Xzibit (pronounced "exhibit"), is an American rapper, actor, television presenter, and radio personality. He began his musical career in 1992, and signed with Loud Records, an imprint of RCA Records to release his debut studio album, At the Speed of Life (1996). The album saw positive critical reception, modestly entered the Billboard 200, and spawned the single "Paparazzi," which peaked at number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100. His second album, 40 Dayz & 40 Nightz (1998) was met with similar reception and spawned the single "What U See Is What U Get." His success caught the attention of West Coast rapper Dr. Dre, who served as the executive producer for Xzibit's next two albums; his third, Restless (2000) was further commercially-oriented and peaked at number 12 on the Billboard 200. He then departed Loud Records in favor of Columbia Records for the release of his fourth album Man vs. Machine (2003), which peaked at number three on the chart. Both albums were co-released by Xzibit's own label, Open Bar Entertainment. His next albums, Weapons of Mass Destruction (2004) and Full Circle (2006) preceded a brief public hiatus, and he returned for the release of his seventh studio album, Napalm (2012). Since 2013, he performs as a member of the hip-hop supergroup Serial Killers. Xzibit has also gained fame as an actor and presenter, having hosted the reality television program Pimp My Ride during the 2000s. In his acting career, he played Shyne Johnson in the television series Empire. He has also starred in the films Gridiron Gang (2006), The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008), Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009) and Sun Dogs (2017).
