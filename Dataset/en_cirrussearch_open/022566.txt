The 2014 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXII Olympic Winter Games, were a winter multi-sport event held in Sochi, Russia, from 7 to 23 February. A total of 2,873 athletes from 88 nations participated in 98 events in 7 sports across 15 different disciplines. Initially, host nation Russia matched the Soviet Union's 1976 achievement of thirteen gold medals, but 4 gold, 8 silver and 1 bronze medals were stripped due to doping. However, later the Court of Arbitration for Sport reinstated 2 gold, 7 silver and 1 bronze medals. The Netherlands achieved four podium sweeps in the speed skating, dominating the men's 500 metres, men's 5,000 metres, men's 10,000 metres, and women's 1,500 metres, surpassing the previous record of two podium sweeps. Slovenia won its first Winter Olympics gold medal ever, in alpine skiing. This was also the first Winter Olympic gold medal tie. Latvia won its first Olympic gold medal due to medals reallocation after the IOC retested doping samples in November 2017. Luger Armin Zöggeler of Italy became the first athlete to achieve six Winter Olympic medals over six consecutive games, all achieved at the men's singles event. Speed skater Ireen Wüst from the Netherlands achieved five medals (two gold and three silver), more than any other athlete. South Korean-born Russian short track speed skater Viktor Ahn, Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen, and Belarusian biathlete Darya Domracheva tied for the most gold medals, with three each.
