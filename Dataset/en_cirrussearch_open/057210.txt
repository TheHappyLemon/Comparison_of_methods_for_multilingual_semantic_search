Veolia Environnement S.A., branded as Veolia, is a French transnational company with activities in three main service and utility areas traditionally managed by public authorities – water management, waste management and energy services. It previously also managed transport services through its subsidiary Veolia Transport (later Transdev) until January 2019. In 2022, Veolia employed 220,000 employees in 58 countries. Its revenue in that year was recorded at €42,885 billion. It is quoted on Euronext Paris. It is headquartered in Aubervilliers. Prior to 1998 Veolia was known as Compagnie Générale des Eaux. Between 1998 and 2003 the company was known as Vivendi Environnement, having been spun off from the Vivendi conglomerate, most of the rest of which became Vivendi. In 2014, following a major restructuring, the company adopted the unaccompanied Veolia name across its businesses. At the end of 2020, Veolia took over 29.9% of its competitor Suez with the aim of creating a world leader in ecological transformation, a merger whose terms were signed in May 2021.[1] In July 2022, Estelle Brachlianoff became the CEO of the group, succeeding Antoine Frérot, who stayed on as chairman of its board.[2]
