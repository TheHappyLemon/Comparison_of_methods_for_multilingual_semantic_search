Jupiter LV, provisionally known as S/2003 J 18, is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers led by Brett J. Gladman in 2003. Jupiter LV is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20.220 Gm in 604.99 days, at an inclination of 143° to the ecliptic (145° to Jupiter's equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.0509. It belongs to the Ananke group, retrograde irregular moons that orbit Jupiter between 22.8 and 24.1 Gm, at inclinations of roughly 150-155°. The moon was lost following its discovery in 2003. It was recovered in 2017 and given its permanent designation that year.
