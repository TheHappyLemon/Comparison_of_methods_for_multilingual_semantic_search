Khrustalnyi or Krasnyi Luch is a city in Luhansk Oblast, eastern Ukraine. Its population is approximately 79,533 (2022 estimate). It has historically been one of the most important coal mining locations in the Donbas region. The city was founded in the 1880s after the discovery of coal deposits in the region, and grew over the following century. Until 1920, it was known as Kryndachivka, after the surname of an early settler. It was a site of fighting during World War II. Since the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014, it has been occupied by the widely unrecognized Luhansk People's Republic and later by Russia after its Annexation in 30 September 2022.
