In electronics, computer science and computer engineering, microarchitecture, also called computer organization and sometimes abbreviated as Âµarch or uarch, is the way a given instruction set architecture (ISA) is implemented in a particular processor. A given ISA may be implemented with different microarchitectures; implementations may vary due to different goals of a given design or due to shifts in technology. Computer architecture is the combination of microarchitecture and instruction set architecture.
