The National Bolshevik Party (NBP; Russian: Национал-большевистская партия, romanized: Natsional-bolshevistskaya partiya) operated from 1993 to 2007 as a Russian political party with a political program of National Bolshevism. The NBP became a prominent member of The Other Russia coalition of opposition parties. Its members are known as Nazbols (Russian: нацболы). There have been smaller NBP groups in other countries. Its official publication, the newspaper Limonka, derived its name from the party leader's surname and from the idiomatic Russian word for a grenade. The main editor of Limonka was for many years, Aleksey Volynets. Russian courts banned the organization and it never officially registered as a political party. In 2010, its leader Eduard Limonov founded a new political party, called The Other Russia of E. V. Limonov.
