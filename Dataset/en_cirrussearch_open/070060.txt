The Volkswagen Tiguan (German pronunciation: [ˈfɔlksˌvaːgŋ̍ ˈtiːɡu̯aːn]) is a series of cars produced by German manufacturer Volkswagen since 2007, sitting between the smaller T-Roc and the larger Touareg in the company's crossover SUV range. The first generation was based on the PQ46 platform, while the second generation, released in 2016, utilizes the Volkswagen Group MQB A2 platform. It is generally considered to be a medium-sized SUV in Europe, while in North America it is considered to be a compact crossover. The name Tiguan is a portmanteau of the German words Tiger ("tiger") and Leguan ("iguana") and won a naming contest by German car magazine publisher Auto Bild—from a field of names that also included Namib, Rockton, Samun and Nanuk. As of the spring of 2020, six million units had been sold worldwide, with 910,926 units being manufactured in 2019 alone, making the Tiguan the best-selling car overall in the Volkswagen Group. It was also the best-selling SUV in Europe. Its larger counterparts include the Tiguan Allspace, a long-wheelbase family-oriented version of the Tiguan with three-row seating, and the Tiguan X, a coupé SUV.
