The water polo tournaments at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro took place from 6 to 20 August at the Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre in Barra da Tijuca. Twenty teams (twelve for men and eight for women) competed in the tournament. Games that ended in ties in elimination rounds were decided by shootouts, as overtime has been abolished since 2013.
