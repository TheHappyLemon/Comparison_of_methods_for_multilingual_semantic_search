PNC Arena (originally Raleigh Entertainment & Sports Arena and formerly the RBC Center) is an indoor arena located in Raleigh, North Carolina. The arena seats 18,700 for ice hockey and 19,500 for basketball, including 61 suites, 13 luxury boxes and 2,000 club seats. The building has three concourses and a 300-seat restaurant. PNC Arena is home to the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League and the NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team of NCAA Division I. The arena neighbors Carterâ€“Finley Stadium, home of Wolfpack Football; the North Carolina State Fairgrounds and Dorton Arena (on the Fairgrounds). The arena also hosted the Carolina Cobras of the Arena Football League from 2000 to 2002. It is the fourth-largest arena in the ACC (after the JMA Wireless Dome, KFC Yum! Center and the Dean Smith Center) and the eighth-largest arena in the NCAA. The arena opened in 1999 at an estimated construction cost of $158 million. Taxpayers covered half of the construction cost while the team paid the other half. In 2023, the Hurricanes signed an agreement with local government to lease the arena for 20 years in exchange for $300 million in public subsidies for renovations to the arena. As part of the deal, Hurricanes billionaire owner Tom Dundon said he would develop surrounding vacant land into an $800 million mixed-use development.
