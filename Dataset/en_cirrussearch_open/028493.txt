Erie (/ˈɪəri/; EER-ee) is a city on the south shore of Lake Erie and the county seat of Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is the fifth-most populous city in Pennsylvania and the most populous in Northwestern Pennsylvania with a population of 94,831 at the 2020 census. The Erie metropolitan area, equivalent to all of Erie County, had a population of 270,876 in 2020. Erie is located approximately 80 miles (130 km) from Buffalo, 90 miles (140 km) from Cleveland, and 120 miles (190 km) from Pittsburgh. The city was named for the Native American Erie people who lived in the area until the mid-17th century. Erie is nicknamed both the "Gem City", in reference to it once being known as the "Gem of the Great Lakes" due to its fine natural harbor; and more recently, the "Flagship City", from a local marketing effort to promote its status as the home port of Oliver Hazard Perry's flagship Niagara. Erie's manufacturing sector remains prominent in the local economy, while insurance, healthcare, higher education, technology, service industries, and tourism are emerging as significant economic drivers. Like the other Great Lakes port cities, Erie is accessible to the oceans via the Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River network in Canada. The local climate is humid, four-seasonal, and snowy, with warm summers and harsh winters, owing to its southern lakeshore location.
