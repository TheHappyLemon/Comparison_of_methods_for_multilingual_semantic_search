District 13 (French title Banlieue 13 or B13), is a 2004 French action film directed by Pierre Morel and written and produced by Luc Besson. It depicts parkour in several stunt sequences completed without wires or computer-generated imagery. Because of this, some film critics drew comparisons to the Thai film Ong-Bak. David Belle plays Le√Øto, the story's main character. This is the final film which released during Tony D'Amario's lifetime (who played as K2 in the film), before his death in 2005.
