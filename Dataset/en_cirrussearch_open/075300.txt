Bucephalus or Bucephalas (/bjuːˈsɛfələs/; Ancient Greek: Βουκεφάλας; c. 355 BC – June 326 BC) was the horse of Alexander the Great, and one of the most famous horses of classical antiquity. According to the Alexander Romance (1.15), the name "Bucephalus" comes from a brand (or scar) on the thigh of the horse that looks like a bulls head. Ancient historical accounts state that Bucephalus's breed was that of the "best Thessalian strain", and that he died in what is now Punjab, Pakistan, after the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC. Alexander was so grieved at the loss of his horse that he named one of the many cities he founded after him, as Alexandria Bucephalous.
