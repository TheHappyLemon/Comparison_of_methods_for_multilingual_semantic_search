Hydrangea aspera is a species of flowering plant in the family Hydrangeaceae native to dense forests in the region between the Himalayas, across southern China, to Taiwan. It is a large, erect deciduous shrub growing to 3 m (10 ft) tall and wide, with broadly oval leaves and dense branches. The flowers are typically borne in large flat heads in late summer, and are in variable shades of pale blue and pink, fringed by white or pale pink sterile florets. The Latin aspera means "rough-textured" and refers to the downy lower surface of the leaves. Due to how highly cultivated Hydrangea aspera is, coupled with the extensive species range, the related taxonomy of subspecies and potential synonyms is uncertain.
