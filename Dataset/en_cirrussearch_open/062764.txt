Non-Stop is a 2014 action thriller film directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, co-produced by Joel Silver, and starring Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore. It follows an alcoholic ex-NYPD officer turned Federal Air Marshal who must find the killer on an international flight from New York to London after receiving texts saying someone on board will be executed every 20 minutes until financial demands are met. The film marks the second collaboration between Collet-Serra and Neeson after Unknown. An international co-production among France, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, it was the first and only film from Silver Pictures to be distributed by Universal Pictures since the end of Silver's deal with Warner Bros. Released in the United States on February 28, 2014, the movie received generally mixed reviews from critics but was a box-office success, grossing about $223 million off its $50 million budget.
