Macedonia, under the name of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, held from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This was the nation's fifth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics in the post-Yugoslav era. Four athletes were selected to the team by wild card places, without having qualified, competing only in athletics and swimming. This was also the nation's smallest delegation to be sent to the Games in the post-Yugoslav era. Marko Bla≈æevski, medley swimmer and finance student at the Wingate University in North Carolina, was appointed by the Macedonian Olympic Committee to be the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. For the first time in Olympic history, Macedonia did not qualify athletes in freestyle wrestling, slalom canoeing, and shooting. Macedonia failed for the third consecutive time to win an Olympic medal.
