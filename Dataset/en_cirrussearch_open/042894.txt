A thermobaric weapon, also called an aerosol bomb, or a vacuum bomb, is a type of explosive munitions that work by dispersing an aerosol cloud of gas, liquid or powdered explosive. Thermobaric weapons are almost 100% fuel and as a result are significantly more energetic than conventional explosives of equal weight. The fuel is often elemental, rather than a mix of multiple materials. Many types of thermobaric weapons can be fitted to hand-held launchers, and can also be launched from airplanes.
