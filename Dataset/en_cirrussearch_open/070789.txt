S/2003 J 24 (temporarily designated EJc0061) is a moon of Jupiter, discovered by Scott S. Sheppard et al. in 2003. It was independently found by amateur astronomer Kai Ly, who reported it on June 30, 2021. It was formally announced on 15 November 2021 in the MPEC. Ly had previously recovered four "lost" moons of Jupiter in 2020: S/2003 J 23, S/2003 J 12, S/2003 J 4, and S/2003 J 2. S/2003 J 24 orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,088,000 km (0.15433 AU) in 715.4 days, at an inclination of 162° to the ecliptic, in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.25. It belongs to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165°.
