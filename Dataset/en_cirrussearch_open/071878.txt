Famagusta (UK: /ˌfæməˈɡʊstə, ˌfɑːm-/ FA(H)M-ə-GUUST-ə, US: /ˌfɑːməˈɡuːstə/ FAH-mə-GOO-stə), also known by several other names, is a city on the east coast of the de facto state Northern Cyprus. It is located east of Nicosia and possesses the deepest harbour of the island. During the Middle Ages (especially under the maritime republics of Genoa and Venice), Famagusta was the island's most important port city and a gateway to trade with the ports of the Levant, from where the Silk Road merchants carried their goods to Western Europe. The old walled city and parts of the modern city are de facto part of Northern Cyprus as the capital of the Gazimağusa District.
