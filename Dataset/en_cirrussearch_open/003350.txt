The Russia men's national basketball team (Russian: национа́льная сбо́рная Росси́и по баскетболу, romanized: natsionalnaya sbornaya rossii po basketbolu) represents Russia in international basketball competition. They are organized and run by the Russian Basketball Federation (RBF). The team came into existence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and its national team. In the post-Soviet era, the Russia national team consisting of Soviet players under the guidance of Sergei Belov won the silver medal at EuroBasket 1993. It also won silver at the World Cup in consecutive appearances in 1994 and 1998. However, Belov's departure saw Russia face multiple disappointments, until David Blatt took over as head coach. Under Blatt's guidance, the national team became champions at EuroBasket 2007, and also won bronze medals at EuroBasket 2011 and the 2012 Summer Olympics. After Blatt left the staff in late 2012, Russian national basketball experienced a deep crisis due to corruption in the RBF, and the federation's conflict with FIBA. Following a failed performance at EuroBasket 2015, Russia did not qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The situation stabilized after members of the RBF, including president Yulia Anikeeva, were dismissed. The current head coach is Zoran Lukić. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIBA banned Russian teams and officials from participating in FIBA basketball and FIBA 3x3 Basketball competitions.
