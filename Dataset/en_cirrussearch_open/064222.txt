Mumble rap (also widely known as SoundCloud Rap) is a loosely defined microgenre of hip hop music that largely spread via the online audio distribution platform SoundCloud in the 2010s. The term implies a mumbling or unclear vocal delivery by artists, and has been used to describe rappers who do not share the genre's traditional emphasis on meaningful lyricism. While the term mumble rap has been taken as derogatory, some have reappropriated the label, and various critics and artists have defended the style as a new phase in the evolution of the genre.
