Breaking, also called b-boying, b-girling or breakdancing, is a style of street dance developed by African American and Puerto Rican communities in The Bronx, New York City, United States. Breakdancing consists mainly of four kinds of movement—toprock, downrock, power moves, and freezes—and is typically set to songs containing drum breaks, especially in funk, soul, and hip-hop. Its modern dance elements originated among the poor youth of New York during the early 1970s. It is tied to the birth of hip-hop, whose DJs developed rhythmic breaks for dancers. The dance form has expanded globally, with an array of organizations and independent competitions supporting its growth. Breaking will become an Olympic sport at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, per a December 7, 2020, decision by the International Olympic Committee after a proposal by the World DanceSport Federation.
