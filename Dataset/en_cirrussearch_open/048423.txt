The flag of North Macedonia depicts a stylized yellow sun on a red field, with eight broadening rays extending from the center to the edge of the field. It was created by Miroslav Grƒçev and was adopted on 5 October 1995. The eight-rayed sun derives from the national emblem and represents the "new sun of Liberty" referred to in "Denes nad Makedonija" ("Today over Macedonia"). The first post-Yugoslav flag of the country, adopted in 1992, known as the Kutlesh Flag, featured the Vergina Sun, a symbol that had been discovered at Aigai, the first capital and burial ground of the ancient kings of Macedon. Greece imposed a year-long economic embargo in order to persuade the country to remove it from its flag, resulting in the current design.
