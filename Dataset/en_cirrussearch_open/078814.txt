Short track speed skating at the Vancouver 2010 Olympics was held at the Pacific Coliseum, Vancouver, British Columbia on 13â€“26 February 2010. China dominated the competition, sweeping the women's events - winning gold in the 500 m, 1,000 m 1,500 m and 3000 m relay. Wang Meng won three gold medals becoming the most accomplished female short track speed skater in Olympic history and Apolo Ohno became the most decorated Winter Olympian in United States history with eight medals. Haralds Silovs of Latvia became the first athlete in Olympic history to participate in both short track (1500m) and long track (5000m) speed skating, and the first to compete in two different disciplines on the same day. He competed in the 5000m and then raced across town to the 1500m event. The final of the women's 3000 metres relay event was controversially won by the Chinese team, which set a new world record. The South Korean team initially finished first but was disqualified due to illegal contact which was deemed to have impeded a Chinese skater. Australian referee James Hewish subsequently received abusing and threatening emails including personal death threats from angry South Korean fans.
