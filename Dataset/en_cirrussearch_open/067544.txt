The 2023–24 UEFA Champions League is the 69th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 32nd season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. The final will be played at the Wembley Stadium in London, England. The winners of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League will automatically qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League league phase and earn the right to play against the winners of the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League in the 2024 UEFA Super Cup. They will also qualify for the final of the brand-new 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the expanded 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. This edition is the final season with the current format of 32 teams participating in the group stage, after UEFA had announced that a new expanded format would be introduced for the following edition. Manchester City are the defending champions, having won their first title in the previous edition.
