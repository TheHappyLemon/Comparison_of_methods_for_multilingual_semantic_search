Cortina Cortina d'Ampezzo The FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2021 were held from 8–21 February in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. In May 2020, the Italian Winter Sports Federation (FISI) and the event organizing committee asked the International Ski Federation (FIS) to postpone the event until 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the request was rejected by FIS, and the organizers then moved forward with plans for 2021. The host city was selected at the FIS Congress in Cancún, Mexico, on 10 June 2016. Cortina d'Ampezzo was the only applicant, and had been a finalist for the previous two championships. Cortina previously hosted the world championships in 1932 and 1956 (Winter Olympics) and has held numerous World Cup events; the Tofane is a regular stop for women's speed events in January. It is scheduled to host the alpine skiing events of the 2026 Winter Olympics. This was the seventh edition in Italy; in addition to Cortina, other sites were Bormio (2005, 1985), Sestriere (1997), and Val Gardena (1970). Sestriere was also the alpine host for the 2006 Winter Olympics, with women's speed events at San Sicario.
