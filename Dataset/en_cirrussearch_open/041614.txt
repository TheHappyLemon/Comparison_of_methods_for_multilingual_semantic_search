This year runs only with 352 days in Turkey. As Friday, December 18, 1926 (Julian Calendar) was followed by Saturday, January 1, 1927 (Gregorian Calendar). 13 days were dropped to make the switch. And technically, Turkey became the very last country on Earth officially adopted the Gregorian Calendar, which ended the 344-year calendrical switch around the world that took place since October 1582 by virtue of the Papal Bull made by Pope Gregory XIII.
