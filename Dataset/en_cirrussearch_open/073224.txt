The Order of Viesturs (Latvian: Viestura ordenis) is a Latvian state order founded in 1938, which was temporarily discontinued in 1940 by the Soviet occupation of Latvia, but was re-established in 2004. The order is named after the medieval historical figure King Viesturs of ancient Semigallia. Currently it is the highest military-related award still awarded by Latvia.
