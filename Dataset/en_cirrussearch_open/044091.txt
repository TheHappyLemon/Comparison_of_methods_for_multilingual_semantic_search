Moonbeam City is an adult animated television series that was created by Scott Gairdner, and starred the voices of Elizabeth Banks, Rob Lowe, Kate Mara and Will Forte. It premiered on Comedy Central on September 16, 2015. A parody of 1980s cop shows such as Miami Vice and City Hunter[citation needed], the show was sponsored by the Canadian government and animated by Toronto-based studio Solis Animation using Adobe After Effects software. Moonbeam City featured a distinctive 80s-influenced futuristic visual style with heavy use of neon lighting, inspired by media such as Tron; character designs were similar to the style of the artist Patrick Nagel. A synthwave soundtrack was performed by Night Club. On March 30, 2016, the series was cancelled after one season.
