The Nokia Asha 200 (Dual Sim Phone) & Nokia Asha 201 (Single Sim Phone) are budget-level additions to the Nokia Asha family released in Q4 2011. Both devices run the Nokia S40 mobile operating system. There is no direct predecessor of the phones, though the closest to it is the Nokia X2-01, which has similar features and a very similar user interface, as well as having better music capabilities. The Nokia C3 is also an indirect predecessor, also using similar features, though the C3 is a higher end device. The phones are successors to the Nokia X1-01, as they use the same bright colors and the same Dual SIM support for Nokia Asha 200.
