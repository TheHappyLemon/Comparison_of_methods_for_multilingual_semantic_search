WALL-E (stylized as WALLÂ·E) is a platform video game developed by Heavy Iron Studios and published by THQ, based on the 2008 film of the same name. WALL-E's reception differed by the version of the game. The Heavy Iron-developed versions of the game received mixed reviews, with criticisms being levied at the poor camera and repetitive gameplay. The game saw a more lukewarm reception with the Asobo and Savage-developed versions for their longer lengths and varied gameplay. The Helixe version in particular was highly criticized for its lack of music, poor camera, and simple yet frustrating gameplay.
