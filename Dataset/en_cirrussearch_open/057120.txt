Mason Will John Greenwood (born 1 October 2001) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for La Liga club Getafe, on loan from Premier League club Manchester United. A graduate of United's youth system, Greenwood scored in a UEFA Europa League match against Astana in September 2019, to become the club's youngest ever goalscorer in European competition at the age of 17 years, 353 days. His senior international debut for England came in September 2020, in a UEFA Nations League game against Iceland. In January 2022, Greenwood was arrested on suspicion of raping and assaulting a woman, and later on suspicion of sexual assault and making death threats. Since then, Greenwood has not trained with or appeared for United or England. He was charged in October 2022 with attempted rape, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and controlling and coercive behaviour. In February 2023, all charges against him were dropped. In August 2023, Greenwood and Manchester United announced that he would leave the club; he was loaned to Getafe in September 2023.
