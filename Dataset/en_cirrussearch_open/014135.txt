Niko Kranjčar (pronounced [nǐːko krâɲtʃaːr]; born 13 August 1984) is a Croatian former professional footballer. He primarily played as an attacking midfielder, but could also operate as a winger or second striker. As of 5 May 2021, he works as an assistant to Josip Šimunić at the Croatia national under-19 team. He has played with clubs in his homeland, playing for Dinamo Zagreb before sparking controversy by making a move to their fierce rivals Hajduk Split in January 2005. A transfer to England with Portsmouth soon followed in August 2006, and after several years of attempting to hold on to their key players, Portsmouth decided to sell him at the start of the 2009–10 season, opening the way for a move to Tottenham in September 2009, where he was reunited with his former manager at Portsmouth, Harry Redknapp. He moved on to Ukrainian side Dynamo Kyiv in 2012, where he spent a two-year period on loan at Queens Park Rangers, reuniting with Redknapp for a third time. He finished his career with brief spells in the United States with New York Cosmos and Scotland with Rangers before retiring in 2018. Hailed as the next Robert Prosinečki, Kranjčar was given his international debut by his father Zlatko in August 2004, and went on to represent his country at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2008 and UEFA Euro 2012. In total he won 81 caps for the Croatia national team, scoring 16 goals in the process. His final match for the national team was on 15 October 2013, as he missed the 2014 FIFA World Cup because of a leg injury.
