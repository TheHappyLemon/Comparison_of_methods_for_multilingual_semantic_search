The Nord Express (Northern Express) was a long-distance international express train which for more than a century connected Paris with first Russia and later Poland, the Baltic states and Scandinavia. In its heyday before the First World War, it was considered the ultimate luxury train in Europe. Introduced in 1896 by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which operated sleeping-cars, dining cars and trains deluxe all over Europe, including the Orient Express, it connected Paris and Saint Petersburg. After World War I and the Russian Revolution, the train's route was shortened to Warsaw and Riga instead of Saint Petersburg. And after World War II the "iron curtain" diverted the train's route further to Stockholm and Oslo, until air travel caused the end to this famous train. Although the Nord Express has received significantly less attention than the Orient Express, it is one of the CIWL's best-known luxury trains and has been featured in a number of artistic works.
