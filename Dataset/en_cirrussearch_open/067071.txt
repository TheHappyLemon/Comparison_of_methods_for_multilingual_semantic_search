The Baloch (/bəˈloʊtʃ/ bə-LOHCH) or Baluch (/bəˈluːtʃ/ bə-LOOCH; Balochi: بلۏچ, romanized: Balòc) are a nomadic, pastoral, ethnic group which speaks the Western Iranic Baloch language and is native to the Balochistan region of South and Western Asia, encompassing the countries of Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan. There are also Baloch diaspora communities in neighbouring regions, including in Central Asia, and the Arabian Peninsula. Assimilation of non-Baloch tribes into the Baloch tribal system has been a major phenomenon throughout the history of Baloch people, and today a significant Baloch population has diverse origins. The majority of the Baloch reside within Pakistan. About 50% of the total Baloch population live in the Pakistani province of Balochistan, while 40% are settled in Sindh and a significant albeit smaller number reside in the Pakistani Punjab. They make up 3.6% of Pakistan's total population, and around 2% of the populations of both Iran and Afghanistan.
