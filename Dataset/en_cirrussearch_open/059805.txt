Kłodzko County (Polish: powiat kłodzki) is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, south-western Poland. It came into being on 1 January 1999 as a result of the Polish local government reforms passed in 1998. The county covers an area of 1,643 square kilometres (634 sq mi); its territory almost exactly corresponds to the former Bohemian, later Prussian, County of Kladsko (German: Grafschaft Glatz). It is located in a panhandle called Kłodzko Panhandle. The county's administrative seat is the town of Kłodzko; the other towns are: Duszniki-Zdrój, Nowa Ruda, Polanica-Zdrój, Bystrzyca Kłodzka, Kudowa-Zdrój, Lądek-Zdrój, Międzylesie, Radków, Stronie Śląskie and Szczytna. (The suffix Zdrój appearing in several of these names means "spa".) As of 2019 the total population of the county was 158,600.
