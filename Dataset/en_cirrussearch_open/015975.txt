Latvia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 with the song "Here We Go" written by Ralfs Eilands and Arturas Burke. The song was performed by the group PeR. The Latvian broadcaster Latvijas Televīzija (LTV) organised the national final Dziesma 2013 in order to select the Latvian entry for the 2013 contest in Malmö, Sweden. Twenty-four songs were selected to compete in the national final, which consisted of three shows: two semi-finals and a final. In the semi-finals on 8 and 9 February 2013, six entries were selected to advance from each show. Twelve songs ultimately qualified to compete in the final on 16 February 2013 where two rounds of voting by a public televote and a nine-member jury panel selected "Here We Go" performed by PeR as the winner. Latvia was drawn to compete in the second semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 16 May 2013. Performing as the opening entry for the show in position 1, "Here We Go" was not announced among the top 10 entries of the second semi-final and therefore did not qualify to compete in the final. It was later revealed that Latvia placed seventeenth (last) out of the 17 participating countries in the semi-final with 13 points.
