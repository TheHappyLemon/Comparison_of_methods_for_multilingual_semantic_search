"Katyusha" (Russian: Катюша [kɐˈtʲuʂə] – a diminutive form of Екатерина, Yekaterina — Katherine), also transliterated as "Katjuša", "Katioucha", or "Katiusza", is a Soviet-era folk-based song and military march composed by Matvey Blanter in 1938, with lyrics in Russian written by the Soviet poet Mikhail Isakovsky. It gained fame during World War II as a patriotic song, inspiring the population to serve and defend their land in the war effort. The song was still popular in Russia in 1995. The song is the source of the nickname of the BM-8, BM-13, and BM-31 "Katyusha" rocket launchers that were used by the Red Army in World War II.
