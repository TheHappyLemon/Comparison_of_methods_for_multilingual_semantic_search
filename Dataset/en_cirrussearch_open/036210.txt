Voss is a Norwegian-based bottled water from the village of Vatnestrøm in Iveland municipality, Agder county. Contrary to popular belief, the water is not bottled in the municipality of Voss, which is more than 400 kilometres (250 mi) from the bottling site. It is available in both still and sparkling forms. The company's cylindrical glass bottle was designed by Neil Kraft. In some countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., VOSS still water is also packaged in plastic bottles that retain the cylindrical design.
