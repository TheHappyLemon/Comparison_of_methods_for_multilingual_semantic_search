The Smurfs 2 is a 2013 American fantasy comedy film loosely based on The Smurfs comic book series created by the Belgian comics artist Peyo. It is the second and final installment in the Smurfs live action film series and a sequel to the 2011 film The Smurfs, produced by Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, The Kerner Entertainment Company, and Hemisphere Media Capital, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film was again directed by Raja Gosnell from a screenplay written by Karey Kirkpatrick and the writing teams of J. David Stem and David N. Weiss, and Jay Scherick and David Ronn, and a story conceived by the latter four. The entire main cast reprised their roles from the first film. New cast members include Christina Ricci and J. B. Smoove as members of the Naughties, and Brendan Gleeson as Patrick Winslow's stepfather. The Smurfs 2 was released on July 31, 2013, and received generally negative reviews from critics for its humor, characters, plot, screenplay and perceived lack of fidelity to its source material. The film was not as commercially successful as its predecessor, grossing $347 million against a $105 million budget. It was dedicated to Jonathan Winters, who voiced Papa Smurf in both films and died a few months earlier before the film's release. A fully animated reboot titled Smurfs: The Lost Village was released on April 7, 2017, directed by Kelly Asbury with Sony and Kerner returning to produce the film while having an all new cast (with the exception of Frank Welker as Azrael).
