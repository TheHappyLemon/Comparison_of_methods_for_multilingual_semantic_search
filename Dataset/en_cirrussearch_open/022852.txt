Tatiana Andreyеvna Volosozhar (Russian: Татьяна Андреевна Волосожар, Ukrainian: Тетяна Андріївна Волосожар; born 22 May 1986) is a Ukrainian-born Russian pair skater. With Maxim Trankov, she is the two-time 2014 Olympic champion in the pairs and in team events, the 2013 World champion, a four-time (2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016) European champion, the 2012 Grand Prix Final champion, and a three-time (2011, 2013 and 2016) Russian national champion. They have also won six events on the Grand Prix series. Volosozhar competed for Ukraine with Petr Kharchenko in 2000–04 and with Stanislav Morozov in 2004–10. She and Morozov are four-time Ukrainian national champions (2005, 2007, 2008 and 2010) and finished as high as fourth at the World Championships. In December 2010 she was granted expedited Russian citizenship, as both her parents are Russian. Volosozhar and Trankov are the historic World record holders for the short program, before the scoring change in the 2018–19 season. They are the first figure skaters to win two gold medals at the same Olympics, having taken gold in pairs and in the inaugural team event.
