Kondia or Konda Principality (Russian: Кондинское княжество) was the name of a Mansi principality until the late 16th century. The center of Konda was the settlement of Kartauzh (Russian: Картауж). The Konda Principality became part of the Pelym Principality [ru] as a fiefdom. Pelym resisted the conquests by the Moscow Principality for a long time and finally lost its independence only in the winter of 1593/94. The Russian monarch himself possessed the title of "Sovereign and Grand Prince of Kondia", as included in the full official title. The documentary information about Kondia is scarce.
