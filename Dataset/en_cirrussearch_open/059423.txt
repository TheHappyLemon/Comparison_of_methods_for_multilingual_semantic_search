The four-in-hand "mail coach" driving was one of five equestrian competitions held in late May and early June 1900 at the International Horse Show in Paris. The event was part of the Exposition Universelle, and later classified as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics. There were 31 entrants listed for the event; all 28 of them are known by name (three entered twice each). The event was won by the team of Georges Nagelmackers (one of the competitors who entered twice) of Belgium. The teams of LÃ©on Thome and Jean de Neuflize, both of France, were classified in second and third place respectively. Sources prior to 1996 often did not list this event as Olympic. The IOC website currently has affirmed a total of 95 medal events, after accepting, as it appears, the recommendation of Olympic historian Bill Mallon regarding events that should be considered "Olympic". These additional events include the mail coach event. (Mallon and de Wael had included this event in their Olympic lists.)
