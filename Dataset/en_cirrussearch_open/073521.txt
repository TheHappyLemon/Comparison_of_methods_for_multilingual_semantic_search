The Chinese Grand Prix (Chinese: 中国大奖赛; pinyin: Zhōngguó Dàjiǎngsài) is a round of the Formula One World Championship. The event was held every year from 2004 until 2019 and is contracted to be held in 2024 and 2025. The event was contracted to take place from 2020 to 2023, but was cancelled each of those years as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It is currently held at the Shanghai International Circuit, Jiading, Shanghai. Designed by Hermann Tilke and opened in 2004, the US$240 million Shanghai course was the most expensive Formula One circuit facility until the $6 billion Abu Dhabi course opened five years later. The 5.451 km (3.387 mi) track features one of the trickiest corner combinations on the Formula One calendar: Turn 1 and 2, a demanding 270-degree, right-handed corner combination whose radius increases as the corner progresses.
