Vuvuzela note A standard short 58-centimetre (1.9 ft) vuvuzela plays a single B♭ note. Problems playing this file? See media help. The vuvuzela /vuːvuːˈzɛlə/ is a horn, with an inexpensive injection-moulded plastic shell about 65 centimetres (2 ft) long, which produces a loud monotone note, typically around B♭ 3 (the first B♭ below middle C). Some models are made in two parts to facilitate storage, and this design also allows pitch variation. Many types of vuvuzela, made by several manufacturers, may produce various intensity and frequency outputs. The intensity of these outputs depends on the blowing technique and pressure exerted. The indoor noise level caused the U.S. NCAA to permanently ban them after the 7 February 1987 Division I Men's Ice Hockey game between Brown University at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The noise was so extreme that Brown formally complained and "The RPI Rule" was universally adopted. The vuvuzela is commonly used at football matches in South Africa, and it has become a symbol of South African football as the stadiums are filled with its sound. The intensity of the sound caught the attention of the global football community during the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in anticipation of South Africa hosting the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The vuvuzela has been the subject of controversy when used by spectators at football matches. Its high volume can lead to permanent hearing loss for unprotected ears after close-range exposure, with a sound level of 120 dB(A) (the threshold of pain) at one metre (3.3 ft) from the device opening.
