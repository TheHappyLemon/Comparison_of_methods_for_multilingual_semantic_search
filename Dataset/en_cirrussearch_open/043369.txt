Christopher Edward Hansen (born September 13, 1959) is an American television presenter, journalist, and YouTube personality. He rose to mainstream recognition as a correspondent for Dateline NBC and the host for its short-lived segment To Catch a Predator (2004â€“2007), which revolved around catching potential Internet predators using a sting operation. Despite its cancellation, Hansen saw continued praise for his predator investigations and interviews, which led him to host similarly-formatted shows on other networks. After parting ways with NBC in 2013, he hosted Killer Instinct on Investigation Discovery in 2015, which documented homicide investigations. He became the host for the second and third seasons of the syndicated television program Crime Watch Daily in 2015, where he hosted the segment Hansen vs. Predator. He co-founded the true crime-oriented streaming service TruBlu in 2020, where he produced and starred in the web series TakeDown with Chris Hansen. Hansen has earned numerous awards including eight Emmy Awards, four Edward R. Murrow Awards, three Clarion awards, the National Press Club award, and awards for excellence from the Associated Press and United Press International.
