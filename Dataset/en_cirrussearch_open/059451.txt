Georges Van Der Poele (23 March 1868 â€“ 1944) was a Belgian equestrian and Olympic medalist. In May 1900, Van Der Poele competed in the equestrian events during the International Horse Show in Paris. The show was part of the Exposition Universelle, and the equestrian events were later classified as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics. He came second in the show jumping event with Windsor Squire, and third in the high jump with Ludlow, a horse owned by Baron Carlo de Marchi.
