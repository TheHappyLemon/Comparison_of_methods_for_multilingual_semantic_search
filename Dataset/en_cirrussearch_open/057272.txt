Go_A (Ukrainian: Ґоу_Ей) is a Ukrainian folktronica band formed in 2012. The band represented Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2021, performing "Shum", and placed fifth in the final. The band's name was made by combining the English word "Go" with the Greek letter "Alpha", which symbolizes the beginning of everything, and the band's name is symbolic for "return to the roots". The band includes vocalist Kateryna Pavlenko from Nizhyn, keyboardist and percussionist Taras Shevchenko [uk] from Kyiv, Ihor Didenchuk [uk] from Lutsk (also a member of rap group Kalush), and Ivan Hryhoriak from Bukovyna.
