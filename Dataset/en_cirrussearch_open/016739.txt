The Chad national football team (Arabic: منتخب تشاد لكرة القدم, French: Équipe du Tchad de football), nicknamed Les Sao (Arabic: ساو), represents Chad in international football and is controlled by the Chadian Football Federation, the governing body for football in the country. The team has never qualified for the World Cup finals or Africa Cup of Nations. Home matches are played at the Idriss Mahamat Ouya Stadium. In April 2021, FIFA banned the Chad national football team from participating in global football over the Chadian government's interference with the Chadian Football Federation.
