The Fighter was released in theaters on December 17, 2010, by Paramount Pictures. The film grossed $129 million worldwide and received largely positive reviews, with critics praising the performances; many commented that Bale's physical transformation, accent, and mannerisms made for one of the greatest performances of that year.
