Rønne is the largest town on the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. It has a population of 13,798 (1 January 2023). It was a municipality in its own right from 1970 until 2002, when Bornholm was a county (Danish: Bornholms Amt). It has an area of 29.11 square kilometres (11.24 square miles), and is the administrative centre of the Bornholm municipality. As of 2018[update] 11,539 inhabitants live in Rønne Parish (number 16 on the map of parishes), which is a narrow piece of land on the westernmost of the island and stretching north and southward comprising around a third of the area of the former municipality. Knudsker Parish (number 11 on the map) made up the rest of the former municipality. Not all inhabitants of either Rønne (statistikbanken.dk/(table) KM1:number 400-7552) or Knudsker (400-7553) parishes live in the city (contiguous built-up area) of Rønne. Owing to its natural harbour and its strategic position in the Baltic Sea, Rønne has an interesting history coming under German and Swedish influence during its development as a herring fishing port. Today, with its cobbled streets, half-timbered houses and interesting museums, it attracts visitors mainly from Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Poland.
