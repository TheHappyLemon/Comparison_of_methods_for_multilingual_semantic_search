The Football War (Spanish: La guerra del f√∫tbol), also known as the Soccer War or the Hundred Hours' War, was a brief military conflict fought between El Salvador and Honduras in 1969. Existing tensions between the two countries coincided with rioting during a 1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier. The war began on 14 July 1969 when the Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The Organization of American States (OAS) negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence "100 Hour War"), which took full effect on 20 July. Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August. The war, while brief, had major consequences for both countries and was a major factor in starting the Salvadoran Civil War a decade later.
