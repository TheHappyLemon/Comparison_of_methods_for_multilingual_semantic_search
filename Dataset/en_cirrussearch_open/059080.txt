The Oceanian section of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification acted as qualifiers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, to be held in Qatar, for national teams which are members of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC). A total of 0.5 slots in the final tournament were available for OFC teams, which equated to one inter-confederation play-off slot. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Oceania, the qualification was held as a centralised tournament in Qatar from 17 to 30 March 2022.
