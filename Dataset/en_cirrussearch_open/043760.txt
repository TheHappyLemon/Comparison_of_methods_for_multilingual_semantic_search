The Waldstadion (German pronunciation: [ˈvalt.ʃtaːdi̯ɔn] , Forest Stadium), currently known as Deutsche Bank Park for sponsorship purposes, is a retractable roof sports stadium in Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany. The home stadium of the football club Eintracht Frankfurt, it was opened in 1925. The stadium has been upgraded several times since then; the most recent remodelling was its redevelopment as a football-only stadium in preparation for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2006 FIFA World Cup. With a capacity of 58,000 spectators for league matches, it is the seventh largest football stadium in Germany. The stadium was one of the nine venues of 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, and hosted four matches including the final. It will also host five matches of the UEFA Euro 2024. The sports complex, which is owned by the city of Frankfurt, includes the actual stadium and other sports facilities, including a swimming pool, a tennis complex, a beach volleyball court and a winter sports hall. The arena has its own railway station, Frankfurt Stadion, on the national rail network. In 2023, it hosted two regular season National Football League (NFL) American football games as part of the NFL Germany Games.
