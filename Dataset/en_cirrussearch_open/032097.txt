Kwangmyongsong-4 (Korean for 'Bright Star-4' / 'Lodestar-4') or KMS-4 is a reconnaissance satellite launched by North Korea on 7 February 2016. The launch happened after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on 6 January and as the United Nations Security Council was deciding on sanctions to be placed on the country following the nuclear test. The launch was also timed to celebrate the 74th birthday of the late leader Kim Jong-il on February 16.
