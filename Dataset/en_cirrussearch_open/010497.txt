The Kursenieki (Latvian: kursenieki, German: Kuren – 'Curonians', Lithuanian: kuršininkai, kuršiai) are a nearly extinct Baltic ethnic group living along the Curonian Spit. "Kuršiai" refers only to inhabitants of Lithuania and former East Prussia that speak a southwestern dialect of Latvian. Some autochthonous inhabitants of Šventoji in Lithuania call themselves "kuršiai" as well.
