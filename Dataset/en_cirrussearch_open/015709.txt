¡Dos! (stylized in all caps) is the tenth studio album by the American rock band Green Day. The album was released on November 9, 2012, in Australia, November 12 in the United Kingdom and on November 13 in the United States through Reprise Records. It is the second installment in the ¡Uno! ¡Dos! ¡Tré! trilogy. Following its predecessor's power pop style, ¡Dos! was billed as Green Day's take on garage rock. The album accumulated the highest average reviews of all three trilogy albums, receiving generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its dynamic style and catchy songs; others found its music dull and observed filler on the album. It debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 69,000 copies in the United States, a low for the band, becoming their first album since signing to a major record label to not sell 100,000 records in its first week.
