He promoted the Sunshine Policy, a policy of appeasement toward North Korea, and held the first-ever inter-Korean summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in June 2000. He was a 2000 Nobel Peace Prize recipient for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea and Japan in December 2000. He is also the only Korean to have won the Nobel Prize to date. He was sometimes referred to as "the Nelson Mandela of Asia". After completing his term in 2003, he died at the age of 85 on 18 August 2009 due to multiple organ failure and respiratory distress syndrome caused by pneumonia.
