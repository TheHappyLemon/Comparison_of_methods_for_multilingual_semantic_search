Styphnic acid (from Greek stryphnos "astringent"), or 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3-benzenediol, is a yellow astringent acid that forms hexagonal crystals. It is used in the manufacture of dyes, pigments, inks, medicines, and explosives such as lead styphnate. It is itself a low-sensitivity explosive, similar to picric acid, but explodes upon rapid heating.
