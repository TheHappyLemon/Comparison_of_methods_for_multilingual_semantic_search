Early Olympic Games allowed for individuals in a team to be from different nations. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) now groups their results together under the mixed team designation (IOC code ZZX). During the 1900 Summer Olympics, several teams comprising international members won 19 medals in 12 different events.
