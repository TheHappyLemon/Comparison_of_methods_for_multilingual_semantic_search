The Crișul Alb (Romanian), (Hungarian: Fehér-Körös) is a river in western Romania, in the historical region of Transylvania, and in south-eastern Hungary (Békés County). Its source is in the southern Apuseni Mountains (Romanian: Munții Apuseni) of Romania. It flows through the towns of Brad, Ineu, Chișineu-Criș in Romania, and Gyula in Hungary. Crossing the border of Hungary, the river, now called Fehér-Körös, joins the Fekete-Körös (Crișul Negru) a few kilometres north from Gyula to form the river Körös (Criș) which ultimately flows into the Danube. In Romania, its length is 234 km (145 mi) and its basin size is 4,240 km2 (1,640 sq mi).
