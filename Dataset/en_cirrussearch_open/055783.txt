Brendan Leipsic (born May 19, 1994) is a Canadian-Russian professional ice hockey forward currently under contract with SKA Saint Petersburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Leipsic was selected by the Nashville Predators in the third round (89th overall) of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. After stints with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Vegas Golden Knights, Vancouver Canucks and Los Angeles Kings, he was signed by the Washington Capitals to a one-year, $700,000 contract on July 1, 2019. During the indefinite suspension of league play due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Leipsic was the subject of controversy after a conversation on Leipsic's private Instagram account was leaked to the public. In response to his conduct, on May 8, 2020, the Capitals placed Leipsic on unconditional waivers for purposes of terminating his contract. Leipsic cleared waivers the following day and his contract was terminated. Following his termination from the Capitals, Leipsic moved to Russia to play in the Kontinental Hockey League. After three years in the country, Leipsic requested and was granted Russian citizenship on July 12, 2023.
