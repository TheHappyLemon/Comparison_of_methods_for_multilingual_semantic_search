The Cebuano Wikipedia (Cebuano: Wikipedya sa Sinugboanong Binisay√¢) is the Cebuano-language edition of Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia. Despite being the second-largest Wikipedia in numbers of articles, it has a small community of only 157 active users; nearly all of the 6,121,466 articles were initially created through automatic programs, most notably Sverker Johansson's Lsjbot.
