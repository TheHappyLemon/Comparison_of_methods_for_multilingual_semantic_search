Jaws: The Revenge is a 1987 American horror film produced and directed by Joseph Sargent. The fourth and final film in the Jaws franchise, it stars Lorraine Gary, who came out of retirement to reprise her role from the first two films, along with new cast members Lance Guest, Mario Van Peebles, Karen Young and Michael Caine. The film focuses on a now-widowed Ellen Brody (Gary) and her conviction that a great white shark is seeking revenge on her family, particularly when it kills her youngest son, and follows her to the Bahamas. The film was made in less than nine months. Production began in September 1986 so that the film could be released the following summer. Jaws: The Revenge was shot on location in New England and in the Bahamas and completed on the Universal lot. As with the first two films, Martha's Vineyard was the location of the fictional Amity Island for the opening scenes. Delays caused by the mechanical sharks and the weather led to concerns about whether the release date would be met. Ultimately, some critics suggested that the rushed production compromised the quality of the film. Jaws: The Revenge was the lowest grossing film of the franchise, with $51.9 million total gross (worldwide). It was universally lambasted by critics and audiences alike, who lamented the convoluted story, poor acting, and cheap-looking effects and felt like the franchise had run its course. The film introduced the infamous tagline "This time, it's personal."
