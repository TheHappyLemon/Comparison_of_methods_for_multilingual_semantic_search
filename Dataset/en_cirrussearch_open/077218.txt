Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport (IATA: SGN, ICAO: VVTS) (Vietnamese: Sân bay quốc tế Tân Sơn Nhất or Cảng hàng không quốc tế Tân Sơn Nhất) is the busiest international airport in Vietnam, with 32.5 million passengers in 2016 38.5 million passengers in 2018, and 42 million passengers in 2023. It serves Ho Chi Minh City as well as the rest of southeastern Vietnam. As of April 2023, it had a total capacity of only 28 million passengers, which has caused constant congestion and sparked debate for expanding or building a new airport. In 2022, It was the 34th busiest airport in the world, and the second busiest in Southeast Asia. Of the routes the airport offers, the domestic Ho Chi Minh City – Hanoi route is the busiest in Southeast Asia and the fifth busiest in the world, serving 10,253,530 customers in 2019. The airport's IATA code, SGN, is derived from the city's former name of Saigon.
