Jonjo Shelvey (born 27 February 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder or central midfielder for Turkish Süper Lig club Çaykur Rizespor and the England national football team. Shelvey began his career at Charlton Athletic, becoming their youngest-ever player at 16 years and 59 days old. In 2010, he moved to Liverpool for an initial £1.7 million, spending a brief loan at Blackpool. During his time at Anfield, Shelvey was part of a Liverpool squad which won the League Cup and lost the FA Cup final in 2012. He joined Swansea City for £5 million in 2013, and Newcastle United for £12 million two and a half years later. A month after joining Newcastle, he was made the team's stand-in captain in the absence of Fabricio Coloccini, as the season ended with relegation. He has since helped the club regain Premier League status, and established himself as Newcastle's vice captain. Shelvey played for England at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 level and has captained the under-19 team. He won his first cap for the senior team in 2012.
