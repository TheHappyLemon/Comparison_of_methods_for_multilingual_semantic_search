Gefreiter ([ɡəˈfraɪ̯tɐ], abbr. Gefr.; plural Gefreite, English: private, in the military context) is a German, Swiss and Austrian military rank that has existed since the 16th century. It is usually the second rank or grade to which an enlisted soldier, airman or sailor could be promoted. The word has also been lent into the Russian language Yefreytor (Russian: ефрейтор) and is in use in several Russian and post-Soviet militaries.
