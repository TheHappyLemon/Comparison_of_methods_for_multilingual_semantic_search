Aglona (Latgalian: Aglyuna, Russian: Аглона, hist. German: Aglohn) is a village in Preiļi Municipality, Latvia. It is located 40 kilometers (25 mi) northeast of the city of Daugavpils. Located on the narrow strip of land between the lakes Cirišs and Egles, the present-day village is the result of merger of three settlements: Aglona, Somerseta and Jaunciems. The scenery of the surrounding area attracts visitors during the summer.[citation needed] Traditionally, many families from Russia spend their summers in the countryside near Aglona.[citation needed] The nearby Sacrifice Island (Latvian: Upursala), Devil's Lake (Latvian: Velnezers), and the Madelanu Castle Mound are among the most beautiful places in Latvia.[citation needed] The surrounding pine forests have suffered from excessive logging in recent years.[when?]
