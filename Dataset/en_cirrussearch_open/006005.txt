The Gjelsvik Mountains are a group of mountains about 25 nautical miles (50 km) long, between the Sverdrup Mountains and the Mühlig-Hofmann Mountains in Queen Maud Land, East Antarctica. With its summit at 2,705 metres (8,875 ft), the massive Risemedet Mountain forms the highest point in these mountains,[citation needed] also marking their eastern end.
