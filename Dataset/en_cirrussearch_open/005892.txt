The 1985 NHL Entry Draft was the 23rd NHL Entry Draft. It was the first draft outside Montreal. The event was held at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre in Toronto, Ontario, and attended by 7,000 fans. The National Hockey League (NHL) teams selected 252 players eligible for entry into professional ranks, in the reverse order of the 1984–85 NHL season and playoff standings. Toronto hosted and made the first overall pick; this coincidence would not occur again until Montreal hosted and drafted first at the 2022 Draft. The last active players in the NHL from this draft class were Joe Nieuwendyk and Sean Burke, who both played their last NHL games in the 2006–07 season.
