The Croatian Olympic Committee (Croatian: Hrvatski olimpijski odbor (HOO)) is the non-profit organization representing Croatian athletes in the International Olympic Committee. The COC organizes Croatia's representatives at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. It also organizes the Croatian contingent at smaller events such as the Mediterranean Games. Members of the committee are 44 sports federations, which elect the Executive Council composed of the president and 15 members. In 2006, the COC organized the first Croatian World Games in Zadar. These games gather various groups of diaspora Croats against contingents from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
