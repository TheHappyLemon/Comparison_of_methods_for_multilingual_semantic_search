The city, dubbed as the "South Summer Capital of the Philippines", is bordered north by Impasugong; west by Lantapan; south by Valencia and San Fernando; and east by Cabanglasan and Agusan del Sur. It was formerly part of the province of Misamis Oriental as a municipal district in the late 19th century.

It was then formally established as a municipality on October 19, 1907, and was created into a city on February 11, 1998, by virtue of Republic Act 8490. Malaybalay City is the venue of the Kaamulan Festival, held annually from mid-February to March 10.
