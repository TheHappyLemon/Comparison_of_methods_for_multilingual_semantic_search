Reticular connective tissue is a type of connective tissue with a network of reticular fibers, made of type III collagen (reticulum = net or network). Reticular fibers are not unique to reticular connective tissue, but only in this tissue type are they dominant. Reticular fibers are synthesized by special fibroblasts called reticular cells. The fibers are thin branching structures.
