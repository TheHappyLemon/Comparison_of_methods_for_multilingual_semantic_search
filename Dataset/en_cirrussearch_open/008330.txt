Rebecca Renee Black (born June 21, 1997) is an American singer, songwriter, and YouTuber. She gained extensive media coverage when the music video for her 2011 debut single "Friday" went viral on YouTube and various social media sites. The song peaked at number 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 amidst being panned by audiences and music critics, many of whom considered it "among the worst songs ever made". In 2013, Black released a follow up single "Saturday" (with Dave Days) to similar commercial success and marginally improved reception. Black has also pursued a career as a YouTube personality. Her debut studio album Let Her Burn—preceded by two extended plays—was released in February 2023 to generally favorable critical reception.
