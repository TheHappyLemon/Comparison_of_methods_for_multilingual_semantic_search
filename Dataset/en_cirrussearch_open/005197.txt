Business game (also called business simulation game) refers to simulation games that are used as an educational tool for teaching business. Business games may be carried out for various business training such as: general management, finance, organizational behavior, human resources, etc. Often, the term "business simulation" is used with the same meaning. A business game is defined as "a game with a business environment that can lead to one or both of the following results: the training of players in business skills (hard and/or soft), or the evaluation of players' performances (quantitatively and/or qualitatively)". Business games are used as a teaching method in universities, and more particularly in business schools, but also for executive education. Simulation are considered to be an innovative learning method, and are often computer-based.
