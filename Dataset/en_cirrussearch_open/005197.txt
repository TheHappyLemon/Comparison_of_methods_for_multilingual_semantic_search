The Junior Eurovision Song Contest (often shortened to JESC, Junior Eurovision or Junior EuroSong) is an international song competition which has been organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) annually since 2003. The competition has many similarities to the Eurovision Song Contest from which its name is taken. Each participating broadcaster sends an act, the members of which are aged 9 to 14 on the day of the contest, and an original song lasting three minutes at most to compete against the other participating entries. Each entry represents the country served by the participating broadcaster. Since 2017, viewers from all around the world are invited to vote for their favourite performances by online voting, and a national jury from each participating country also vote. The overall winner of the contest is the entry that receives the most points after the scores from every country have been collected and totalled. The main differences with the Eurovision Song Contest are that in the junior version, the song must be predominantly in the language of the country it represents, and viewers can vote for their own country. The most recent winner is Zoé Clauzure of France, who won the 2023 contest in Nice, France, with her song "Cœur". In addition to the participating countries, the contest has also been broadcast in Finland in 2003 and Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2004 and from 2006 to 2011, Andorra in 2006 and Iceland in 2021, although these countries have not yet taken part in the contest. What's more, since 2006, the contest has been streamed live on the Internet through the official website of the contest. Australia was invited to participate in the 2015 contest, while Kazakhstan was invited in the 2018 contest, making it the only major Eurovision event to feature multiple associate member broadcasters.
