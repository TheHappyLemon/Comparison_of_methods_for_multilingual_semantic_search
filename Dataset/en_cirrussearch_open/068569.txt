Church of the Holy Cross (Lithuanian: Šv. Kryžiaus bažnyčia) is a Roman Catholic church in the Vilnius Old Town. Initially, in 1543 a chapel was built which was later expanded and rebuilt. The current towers were built in 1725. Following the fire in 1737 the church was reconstructed and a late baroque interior was installed. A former monastery complex of the Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God is nearby the church. The church is famous for a spring with miraculous water in its basement (people believe that this water cures eye diseases) and a painting of Mary, mother of Jesus, which bestows favors.
