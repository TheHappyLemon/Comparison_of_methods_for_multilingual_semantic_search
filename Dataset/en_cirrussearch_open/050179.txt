Pasažieru vilciens (lit. 'Passenger train', abbreviated: PV; trade name Vivi) is the only passenger-carrying railway company in Latvia, operating both electric and diesel trains on various lines throughout the country. It was formed in November 2001 by bringing together two separate companies, PPU Elektrovilciens ('Electric Train') and PPU Dīzeļvilciens ('Diesel Train') under one name, creating the first subsidiary of Latvian Railways (Latvijas dzelzceļš). As of October 2008 JSC "Pasažieru vilciens" is an independent state-owned company. As of 2017, the company employed 1,075 people. Vivi currently operates ten routes (four electric, six diesel) with its main operating base being the capital city, Riga; and carried 18.6 million passengers in 2019. In November 29, 2023, Pasažieru vilciens launched a rebrand to Vivi (from the Latvian phrase vienā vilcienā - 'on one train') and a signal yellow-grey colour scheme. The gradual rebrand is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2024. The original name will be kept as the legal name of the company.
