The nordic combined competition of the 2010 Winter Olympics was held at Whistler Olympic Park. The events were held between 14 and 25 February 2010. Sprint and individual Gundersen events of 7.5 km and 15 km events were replaced by two 10 km individual events with one jump each from the normal and large hills respectively. Team event went from two jumps down for one jump per team member. This was done during the 2008–09 Nordic Combined World Cup season and was also applied to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 in Liberec, Czech Republic.
