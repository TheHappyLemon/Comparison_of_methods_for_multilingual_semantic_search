Ioannis Georgios Lavrentis (Greek: Ιωάννης Λαυρέντης) was a Greek athlete who was likely the second runner to win a marathon. On March 12, 1896, he was first in a field of 38 runners attempting to qualify for the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece (3:11:27). One month later, he was one of 17 athletes to compete in the first Olympic marathon. Seven runners, including Lavrentis, did not finish the race.
