Count Erik Jönsson Dahlbergh (10 October 1625 – 16 January 1703) was a Swedish military engineer, Governor-general and Field marshal. He rose to the level of nobility through his military competence. According to Cathal Nolan, Count Dahlberg was a highly innovative military engineer in the 17th and 18th century, often referred to as the "Swedish Vauban". He was expert in both building and destroying fortifications. In warfare he won several sieges, including Copenhagen and Kronborg. He famously led a Swedish army across the frozen Great and Little Belts to attack Copenhagen. Dahlberg commanded Swedish engineers in several wars and his historic influence was ensured via his skill at map-making, the fortresses he designed, and his widely read writings on military architecture. Today he is well known through his Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna, a collection of engravings of topographical research.
