Since the 19th century, industry and tourism have been important elements of the city's economy. Under Soviet rule Bila Tserkva became a centre of agricultural education. During the Cold War an major base of the Soviet Air Force was located near the city. In independent Ukraine, until 2020 Bila Tserkva served as a city of regional significance.
