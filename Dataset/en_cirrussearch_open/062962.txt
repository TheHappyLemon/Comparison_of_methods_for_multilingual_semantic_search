In organic chemistry, phthalic acid is an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, with formula C6H4(CO2H)2 and structure HO(O)C−C6H4−C(O)OH. Although phthalic acid is of modest commercial importance, the closely related derivative phthalic anhydride is a commodity chemical produced on a large scale. Phthalic acid is one of three isomers of benzenedicarboxylic acid, the others being isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid.
