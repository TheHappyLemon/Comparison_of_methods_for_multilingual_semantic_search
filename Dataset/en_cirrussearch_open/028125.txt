The Zagros Mountains (Persian: کوه‌های زاگرس, romanized: Kuh hā-ye Zāgros; Arabic: جبال زاغروس, romanized: Jibal Zaghrus; Kurdish: چیاکانی زاگرۆس, romanized: Çiyakanî Zagros; Turkish: Zagros Dağları; Luri: Kûya Zagrus کویا زاگرس or کوه یل زاگرس) are a long mountain range in Iran, northern Iraq, and southeastern Turkey. The mountain range has a total length of 1,600 km (990 mi). The Zagros range begins in northwestern Iran and roughly follows Iran's western border while covering much of southeastern Turkey and northeastern Iraq. From this border region, the range continues southeast under also the waters of the Persian Gulf. It spans the southern parts of the Armenian highlands, the whole length of the western and southwestern Iranian plateau, ending at the Strait of Hormuz. The highest point is Mount Dena, at 4,409 metres (14,465 ft).
