Love Actually is a 2003 British romantic comedy film written and directed by Richard Curtis. The Christmas holiday film features an ensemble cast, composed predominantly of British actors, many of whom had worked with Curtis in previous projects. An international co-production between the U.K., U.S., and France, it was mostly filmed on-location in London, England. The movie delves into different aspects of love as shown through 10 separate stories involving a variety of individuals, many of whom are interlinked as the plot progresses. The story begins five weeks before Christmas and is played out in a weekly countdown until the holiday, followed by an epilogue that takes place in the New Year. The film was released in the U.S. on 14 November 2003 and a week later in the U.K. during its theatrical run. Love Actually was a box-office success, grossing $245 million worldwide on a budget of $40 million. The film received mixed reviews and received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. A made-for-television short film sequel, Red Nose Day Actually, aired in two different versions on BBC One and NBC in 2017.
