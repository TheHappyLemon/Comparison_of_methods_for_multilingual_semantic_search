Motherwell Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, which plays in the Scottish Premiership. Motherwell have not dropped out of the top-flight of Scottish football since 1985, and have lifted one trophy in that time – the Scottish Cup in 1991. Clad in their traditional claret and amber, Motherwell play their home matches at Fir Park Stadium and have done so since 1896. The club's main rivals over the years have been Hamilton Academical and Airdrieonians, due in part to their close geographical proximities. These matches are known as the Lanarkshire derby. The club have won four major trophies in domestic football: the Scottish League title in 1931–32, the Scottish Cup in 1951–52 and 1990–91, and the Scottish League Cup in 1950–51. Sports Illustrated has suggested Motherwell F.C.'s fans as the originators of the "Viking Thunder Clap", a supporting chant eventually popularized by the fans of the Iceland national football team where fans stay silent and let out loud synchronized claps seconds apart, gradually speeding up; the chant received wider international attention during Euro 2016.
