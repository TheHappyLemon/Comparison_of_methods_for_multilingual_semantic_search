OpenTimestamps (OTS) is an open-source project that aims to provide a standard format for blockchain timestamping. With the advent of systems like Bitcoin, it is possible to create and verify proofs of existence of documents (timestamps) without relying on a trusted third party; this represents an enhancement in term of security, since it excludes the possibility of a malicious (or careless) trusted third party to compromise the timestamp. OTS defines a set of rules for conveniently creating timestamps and later independently verifying them. Currently, timestamping with Bitcoin is fully supported, however the format is flexible enough to support a variety of methods. Anyone could create timestamp with the permissionless blockchain by paying the transaction fees, for convenience OTS built an infrastructure that aggregates timestamp requests from users and packs them into transactions funded by public calendar servers; as a result, users can timestamp for free, in a trust-minimized setting.
