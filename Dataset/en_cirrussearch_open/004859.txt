The Mizuho Station (Japanese: みずほ基地, Hepburn: Mizuho Kichi) was a permanent Japanese Antarctic transshipment station. Located on Mizuho Plateau 2230 m above sea level, it was opened in 1970. It was operated by the Japanese National Institute of Polar Research, and closed in 1987. It was occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and glaciological observations.
