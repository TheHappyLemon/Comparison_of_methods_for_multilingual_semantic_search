Pood (Russian: пуд, tr. pud, IPA: [put], plural: pudi or pudy) is a unit of mass equal to 40 funt (фунт, Russian pound). Since 1899 it is set to approximately 16.38 kilograms (36.11 pounds). It was used in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. Pood was first mentioned in a number of 12th-century documents. Unlike funt, which came at least in the 14th century from Middle High German: phunt, Old East Slavic: пудъ pud (formerly written *пѫдъ pǫdŭ) is a much older borrowing from Late Latin "pondo", from Classical "pondus".
