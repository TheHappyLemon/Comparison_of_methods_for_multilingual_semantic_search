Sathya Sai Baba (born Ratnakaram Sathyanarayana Raju; 23 November 1926 – 24 April 2011) was an Indian guru and philanthropist. At the age of fourteen, he claimed that he was the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba, and left his home to accept his devotees. Sai Baba's believers credited him with miracles such as materialisations of vibhuti (holy ash) and other small objects such as rings, necklaces and watches, along with reports of miraculous healings, resurrections, clairvoyance, bilocation and was purportedly omnipotent and omniscient. His devotees believe them to be signs of his divinity, while some individuals have concluded that his acts were based on sleight of hand or had other explanations that were fake and not supernatural. In 1963, Universalist Avatar Meher Baba referred to Sathya Sai as "the tantric and using tantric powers for his so-called "miracles." In 1972, Sathya Sai Baba founded the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust. Its goal was "to enable its members to undertake service activities as a means to spiritual advancement". Through this organisation, Sathya Sai Baba established a network of free super speciality hospitals and general hospitals, clinics, drinking water projects, a university, auditoriums, ashrams, and education technology.
