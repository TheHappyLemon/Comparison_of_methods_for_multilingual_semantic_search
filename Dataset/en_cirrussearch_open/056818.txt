Sweetwater was an American rock band originally from Los Angeles, California. They were the act scheduled to open the Woodstock festival in 1969 but were stuck in traffic, so that folksinger Richie Havens's trio was the first act to perform. Sweetwater was eventually flown into Woodstock by helicopter and performed next, becoming the first band to perform at the festival.
