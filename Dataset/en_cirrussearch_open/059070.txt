The 1988–89 European Cup was the 34th season of the European Cup football club tournament. The competition was won for the first time since 1969, and third time overall, by Milan comfortably in the final against former winners Steaua București. As the defending champions, PSV Eindhoven received a bye to the second round, but were eliminated by Real Madrid in the quarter-finals. English clubs were still banned, following the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985, so Liverpool were denied a place in the competition.
