Diamond Eyes is the sixth studio album by the American alternative metal band Deftones, released on May 4, 2010, by Reprise Records. It was the first album to feature bassist Sergio Vega, who replaced original bassist Chi Cheng. An album tentatively titled Eros was originally intended to be the band's sixth full-length release following Saturday Night Wrist (2006), but was not finished due to Cheng entering a coma after a serious car accident that occurred in November 2008, eventually resulting in his death in 2013. The band continued on with Vega as his replacement, and the release of Eros was put on hold in favor of Diamond Eyes in June 2009. Diamond Eyes was a critical and commercial success, peaking within the top ten of the US Billboard 200 and several other international charts; it was the band's highest charting album on the Billboard 200 since their 2003 eponymous fourth album. Four singles were released from Diamond Eyes: the title track, "Rocket Skates", "Sextape", and "You've Seen the Butcher".
