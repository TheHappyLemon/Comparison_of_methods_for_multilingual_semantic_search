AaB, (full name: Aalborg Boldspilklub, pronounced [ˈʌlˌpɒˀ ˈpʌlˀtspe̝lˌkʰlup]) internationally referred to as Aalborg BK, or sometimes also known as AaB Aalborg, is a professional football team located in Aalborg. The club is represented in the NordicBet Liga from 2023–24 after relegation from Danish Superliga in 2022–23 and has won four Danish football Championships and three Danish Cup trophies. Most recently the team won the double in 2014. AaB was founded on 13 May 1885 by English engineers who were building Jutland's railway system, and the first years were concentrated on the game of cricket. It was initially named Aalborg Cricketklub (Aalborg Cricket club) but the name of the club was changed to Aalborg Boldklub (Aalborg ballclub) in 1899. Football was adopted on an amateur basis in 1902, and has since been the main sport, as the name was changed to the current Aalborg Boldspilklub af 1885 (Aalborg ballgameclub of 1885) in 1906. In 1995 AaB became the first Danish team to participate in the UEFA Champions League group stage when they were awarded a place because Dynamo Kyiv was expelled from the tournament after one game for attempted match-fixing. AaB qualified for the 2008–09 Champions League and is with two appearances the Danish club who has participated the second most in the tournament after F.C. Copenhagen.
