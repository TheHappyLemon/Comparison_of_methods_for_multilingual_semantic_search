Death playing chess (in Swedish: Döden spelar schack) is a monumental painting in Täby Church located just outside Stockholm, Sweden. It was painted around 1480–1490, by the Swedish medieval painter Albertus Pictor. The painting depicts a man and a skeleton at a chessboard. Above them is a ribbon, now faded, which once read "Jak spelar tik matt", "I checkmate thee". A copy of the mural is stored in the collections of the Swedish Museum of History in Stockholm.
