The common Surinam toad or star-fingered toad (Pipa pipa) is a purely aquatic species of frog in the family Pipidae with a widespread distribution in South America. The species is known for incubating its eggs in honeycombed chambers in the skin of the mother's back, releasing fully formed froglets after a period of 4â€“5 months. It is an ambush predator that lies in wait in the water for prey to come into range, which it then captures using suction feeding.
