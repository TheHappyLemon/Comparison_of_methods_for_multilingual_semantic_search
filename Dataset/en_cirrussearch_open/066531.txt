The Yemen national football team (Arabic: منتخب الْيَمَن الْوَطَنِيُّ لِكُرَّةُ الْقَدَم) represents Yemen in international football. The national team is administered by the Yemen Football Association. When the nation was split into North Yemen and South Yemen before 1990, two national teams existed. After unification, the Yemen national football team is considered the successor of the North Yemen national football team. See the article South Yemen national football team for details on the South Yemen team. Despite being the 5th most populated country in the Middle East, Yemen has never achieved the same success as those with smaller population.
