The 1982–83 season of the European Cup football club tournament was won for the first time by Hamburg, who beat Juventus 1–0 in the final at Athens' Olympic Stadium. It was the first time since 1976 that the trophy was not won by an English club. Aston Villa, the defending champions, were eliminated by Juventus in the quarter-finals. Villa's 3–1 victory over Beşiktaş J.K. was played behind closed doors due to trouble from the Villa crowd against Anderlecht in the previous season’s semi-final in Brussels. Liverpool, the other English side in the tournament, were defeated by Polish champions Widzew Lodz, also in the quarter-finals.
