The Alaska Range is a relatively narrow, 600-mile-long (950Â km) mountain range in the southcentral region of the U.S. state of Alaska, from Lake Clark at its southwest end to the White River in Canada's Yukon Territory in the southeast. Denali, the highest mountain in North America, is in the Alaska Range. The range is part of the American Cordillera. The Alaska range is one of the higher ranges in the world after the Himalayas and the Andes.
