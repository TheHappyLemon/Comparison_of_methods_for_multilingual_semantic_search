The Slovene Wikipedia (Slovene: slovenska Wikipedija) is the Slovene-language edition of the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia. It has been active since 26 February 2002. On 15 August 2010, it reached 100,000 articles. As of March 2024, it has about 185,000 articles. Wikipedia is a widely used reference work and one of the most visited social networking services by users from Slovenia, but official internet usage statistics do not distinguish between Wikipedia editions, analyzing only the base domain wikipedia.org. In most cases, the Slovene-language edition gets a passing note of its existence in media reports about Wikipedia in general. However, as a relatively large and freely accessible body of structured knowledge, Slovene Wikipedia has been used, as an example, for building text corpora for the purpose of training linguistic software and analyzing Slovene literary authors' web presence. There are several successful collaboration projects with professors at the University of Ljubljana, using content creation by students as a teaching method. Active Wikipedians from Slovenia have also been featured in discussions about Wikipedia (both general and Slovene-language specific) in national media.
