In the reign of Ordoño I of Asturias (850–866), the kingdom began to be known as that of León. In 910, an independent Kingdom of León was founded when the king of Asturias divided his territory amongst his three sons. Below follows a list of Leonese monarchs. It is, in part, a continuation of the list of Asturian monarchs.
