TigriSat is a CubeSat built in 2014 by a team of Iraqi students at the La Sapienza University of Rome. It uses an RGB camera to detect dust storms over Iraq, and transmits the data to ground stations in Baghdad and Rome. It is considered Iraq's first satellite. It was launched from Orenburg on June 19, 2014 on a Dnepr launch vehicle. It was deployed using a UniSat-6. As of July 2019, it remains operational.
