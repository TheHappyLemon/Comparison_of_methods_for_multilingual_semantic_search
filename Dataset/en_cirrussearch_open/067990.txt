Jannik Sinner (born 16 August 2001) is an Italian professional tennis player. He has been ranked as high as world No. 2 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), and is the highest-ranked Italian tennis player in history. Sinner has won 13 ATP Tour singles titles, including a Grand Slam title at the 2024 Australian Open and two Masters 1000 titles. He has reached the semifinals at Wimbledon as well as the quarterfinals of the French Open and US Open. At the end of the 2023 season, Sinner was runner-up at the ATP Finals and led Italy to the Davis Cup crown. Sinner also has a career-high ranking of world No. 124 in doubles, achieved in September 2021, and has won one ATP Tour title in doubles. Sinner grew up in northern Italy in the predominantly German-speaking region of South Tyrol. He was active in sports such as skiing, football, and tennis as a child. After being a competitive skier between the ages of 8-12, Sinner switched to focus exclusively on tennis at age 13 and moved to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train with veteran coach Riccardo Piatti. Despite limited success as a junior, Sinner began playing in professional men's events at age 16 and became one of the few players to win multiple ATP Challenger Tour titles at age 17. In 2019, he broke into the top 100, winning the Next Generation ATP Finals and the ATP Newcomer of the Year award. Sinner continued his rise into the top 50 in 2020 with his first top 10 victory, a French Open quarterfinal, and his first ATP Tour title at the 2020 Sofia Open. In 2021, he became the youngest ATP 500 champion at the 2021 Citi Open, was a Masters runner-up at the Miami Open, and became the first player born in the 2000s to enter the top 10 in rankings. After reaching his first major semifinal at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, Sinner won his first Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open. He finished the season by reaching the final of the ATP Finals and contributing to Italy lifting Davis Cup for the first time after 1976. In the 2024 Australian Open, Sinner defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the semifinals to reach his first major final. He then defeated Daniil Medvedev in a five-set final, coming back from two sets down to win his first Grand Slam title.
