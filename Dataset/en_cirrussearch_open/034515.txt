Trickle-down economics is a generally critical term for supply-side economics, criticizing such policies as favoring wealthy individuals and large corporations. In the "trickle down" description, wealthy individuals directly benefit from supply-side style tax cuts, leaving only the leftover wealth to "trickle down" to those less fortunate. The term has been used broadly by critics of supply-side economics to refer to taxing and spending policies by governments that, intentionally or not, result in widening income inequality; it has also been used in critical references to neoliberalism. While economists who favor supply-side economics generally avoid the "trickle down" analogy and dispute the focus on tax cuts to the rich, the phrase "trickle down" has also been occasionally used by proponents of such policies. Similar criticisms have existed since at least the 19th century, though the term "trickle-down economics" was popularized in the U.S. in reference to the economic policies of Ronald Reagan. Major examples of what critics have called "trickle-down economics" in the U.S. include the Reagan tax cuts, the Bush tax cuts, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Major UK examples include Liz Truss's mini-budget tax cuts of 2022. As of 2023, studies have not shown that there is a demonstrable link between reducing tax burdens on the upper end and economic growth.
