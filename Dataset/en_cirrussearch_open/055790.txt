The Grote Markt (Dutch: [ˌɣroːtə ˈmɑr(ə)kt] ; "Big Market") is the central square of Antwerp, Belgium, situated in the heart of the old city quarter. It is surrounded by the city's Renaissance Town Hall, as well as numerous guildhalls with elaborate façades, the majority of which are reconstructions from the 19th and early 20th century, approximating paintings of the square by Flemish artists. A few of the guildhall façades, such as that of Sint-Joris's are intact originals entirely dating back to the 16th century. The square also has many restaurants and cafés, and it lies within walking distance of the Scheldt river. The Grote Markt hosts a Christmas market and ice rink every winter.
