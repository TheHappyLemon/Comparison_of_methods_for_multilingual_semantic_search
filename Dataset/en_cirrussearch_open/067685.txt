The 2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League is the third season of the UEFA Europa Conference League, Europe's tertiary club football tournament organised by UEFA. The final will be played at the Agia Sophia Stadium in Athens, Greece. The winners of the tournament will automatically qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League league stage, unless they qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League through their league performance. This edition will be the final season with the current format of 32 teams participating in the group stage, after UEFA announced that a brand-new format would be introduced for the following edition. Due to the change, no clubs can be transferred from the Europa League group stage to the UEFA Europa Conference League under the Swiss format, and this edition's winners onwards will no longer be able to defend their title. This will also be the final season under its current name as it is renamed to the UEFA Conference League from the 2024–25 season onwards. According to UEFA, the new denomination of the competition will enable further development as a stand-alone competition in their research amongst fans and commercial partners. As the title holders, West Ham United qualified for the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League. They are unable to defend their title after advancing to the Europa League knockout phase.
