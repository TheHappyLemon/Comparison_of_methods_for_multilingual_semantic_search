Orthographic transcription is a transcription method that employs the standard spelling system of each target language. Examples of orthographic transcription are "Pushkin" and "Pouchkine", respectively the English and French orthographic transcriptions of the surname "Пу́шкин" in the name Алекса́ндр Пу́шкин (Alexander Pushkin). Thus, each target language (English and French) transcribes the surname according to its own orthography. Contrast with phonetic transcription, phonemic orthography, transliteration, and translation.
