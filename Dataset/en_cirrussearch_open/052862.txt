The 2012 World Wrestling Championships was held at Millennium Place in Strathcona County, Alberta, Canada. Traditionally, Wrestling World Championships are not held in Olympic years, but in 2012 a female championship was held because the 2012 Summer Olympics included only four of the seven FILA weight classes for females.
