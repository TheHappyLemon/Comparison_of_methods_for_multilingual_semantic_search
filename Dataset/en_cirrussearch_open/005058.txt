The Basketball Super League (Turkish: Basketbol Süper Ligi; TBSL), also known as the Türkiye Sigorta Basketbol Süper Ligi for sponsorship reasons, is the top men's professional basketball division of the Turkish basketball league system. It replaced the former Turkish Basketball Championship (1946–1967) to become the Turkish Basketball League (TBL) until 2015 when it adopted its current name while the TBL name became exclusive to the second-tier and third-tier divisions. The BSL is administered by the Turkish Basketball Federation (TBF) and is contested by 16 teams, with the two lowest-placed teams relegated to the second-tier TBL and replaced by the top two teams of that division. Since the league's restructuring in 1966, 11 clubs have been crowned champions, with Anadolu Efes winning the title a record 16 times and Fenerbahçe 10 times. In recent years, Fenerbahçe won 9 titles out of 15 from the 2006–07 season onward.
