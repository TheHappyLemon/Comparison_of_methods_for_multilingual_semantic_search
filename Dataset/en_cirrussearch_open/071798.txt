On 22 March 2024, a terrorist attack carried out by the Islamic State occurred on the Crocus City Hall music venue in Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast, Russia. The attack began at around 20:00 MSK (UTC+3), shortly before the Russian band Picnic was scheduled to play a sold-out show at the venue. Four gunmen carried out a mass shooting, as well as slashing attacks on the people gathered at the venue, and used incendiary devices to set the venue on fire. Investigators said the attack had killed 144 people (including those who died later in hospital), and more than 551 concertgoers were injured by gunshot wounds and "poisoning" related to the fire. On 28 March, Russian authorities also claimed that a further 95 people were missing. The Islamic State – Khorasan Province (IS–KP), a regional affiliate of the Islamic State that operates along the Afghanistan–Pakistan border, claimed responsibility in a statement through the IS-affiliated Amaq News Agency shortly after the attack. Amaq also published a video filmed by one of the attackers. It showed the attackers shooting victims and slitting the throat of a victim, while the filming attacker was reciting the takbir, praising God and speaking against infidels. Russian president Vladimir Putin called the attack a "barbaric terrorist act" and said that the gunmen had been arrested. He also declared 24 March 2024 to be a national day of mourning, and sought to link assailants to Ukraine. Russia's Foreign Ministry called the incident a terrorist attack. It was the deadliest terrorist attack on Russian soil since the Beslan school siege in 2004. Investigators detained 11 people in relation to the attack, including four suspects, who were charged with terrorism on 24 March.
