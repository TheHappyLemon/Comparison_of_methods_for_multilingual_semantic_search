UPSat was the first satellite manufactured in Greece to be successfully launched into orbit, by the University of Patras and Libre Space Foundation (an earlier Greek-made communications satellite, HELMARS-SAT, although entirely constructed by 1999, was not launched due to budget limitations). It was part of the QB50 mission with ID GR-02. The UPSat mission was the first satellite launched into orbit made entirely of open-source software and open-source hardware.
