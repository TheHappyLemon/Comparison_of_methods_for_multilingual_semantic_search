The Maya (Russian: Мая; Yakut: Маайа, Maaya) is a river in Khabarovsk Krai and Sakha, Russia. It is a right tributary of the Aldan of the Lena basin. The length of the river is 1,053 kilometres (654 mi). The area of its basin 171,000 square kilometres (66,000 sq mi). The Maya was part of the river route from Yakutsk to the Okhotsk Coast. From the Mati either the Lama Portage or the Alanchak Portage led to the Ulya and the coast. Near the southernmost point was the settlement of Nelkan from which a track led over the mountains to Ayan. From Ust-Maya there was a horse-track to Yakutsk. Eastbound boats that reached Ust-Maya from the Lena were replaced by smaller boats to continue up the Maya.
