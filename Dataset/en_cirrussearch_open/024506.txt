Neofelis is a genus comprising two extant cat species in Southeast Asia: the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) of mainland Asia, and the Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) of Sumatra and Borneo. The scientific name Neofelis is a composite of the Greek word neo- (νέος) meaning 'young' and 'new', and the Latin word fēlēs meaning 'cat'.
