Population: 98,365 (2010 Census); 106,341 (2002 Census); 128,083 (1989 Census). The Kuzbass region, where Kiselyovsk is located, supplies 60% of Russia's coal, and the town suffers from heavy pollution due to the dominance of the coal mining and processing industries. The coal ash leads to a phenomenon known as "black snow". Another danger is spontaneous combustion of discarded coal.
