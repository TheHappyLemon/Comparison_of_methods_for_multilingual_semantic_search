Fifty Shades Darker is a 2017 American erotic romantic drama film directed by James Foley and written by Niall Leonard, based on E. L. James's 2012 novel of the same name. The second installment in the Fifty Shades film series and the sequel to the 2015 film Fifty Shades of Grey, it stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, respectively, with Eric Johnson, Eloise Mumford, Bella Heathcote, Rita Ora, Luke Grimes, Victor Rasuk, Kim Basinger, and Marcia Gay Harden in supporting roles. It follows on Ana and Christian as they must decide to rekindle their relationship, this time with "no rules, no punishments, and no more secrets" terms. Before the release of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015, there was high anticipation from fans for the sequel. When the first film premiered at a special fan screening in New York City in February 2015, development on the sequels promptly began. By November 2015, Foley was hired to direct both sequels, which would be shot back-to-back in 2016. Principal photography was initially set to begin in Vancouver in June 2015. However, it was later postponed due to delays in the script. Filming on Fifty Shades Darker and its sequel Fifty Shades Freed (2018) ultimately began on February 9, 2016, in Paris and Vancouver, and concluded on April 11, 2016. Fifty Shades Darker was released in the United States on February 10, 2017. The film grossed over $380 million worldwide against its $55 million budget, despite receiving generally negative reviews for its screenplay, acting and narrative, though some of the performance received some praise. At the 38th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film received nine nominations; including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Dornan) and Worst Actress (Johnson), and won two for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, and Worst Supporting Actress (Basinger).
