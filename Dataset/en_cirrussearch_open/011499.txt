In mathematics, the Kronecker delta (named after Leopold Kronecker) is a function of two variables, usually just non-negative integers. The function is 1 if the variables are equal, and 0 otherwise: δij={0if i≠j,1if i=j.{\displaystyle \delta _{ij}={\begin{cases}0&{\text{if }}i\neq j,\\1&{\text{if }}i=j.\end{cases}}} or with use of Iverson brackets: δij=[i=j]{\displaystyle \delta _{ij}=[i=j]\,} For example, δ12=0{\displaystyle \delta _{12}=0} because 1≠2{\displaystyle 1\neq 2}, whereas δ33=1{\displaystyle \delta _{33}=1} because 3=3{\displaystyle 3=3}. The Kronecker delta appears naturally in many areas of mathematics, physics, engineering and computer science, as a means of compactly expressing its definition above. In linear algebra, the n×n{\displaystyle n\times n} identity matrix I{\displaystyle \mathbf {I} } has entries equal to the Kronecker delta: Iij=δij{\displaystyle I_{ij}=\delta _{ij}} where i{\displaystyle i} and j{\displaystyle j} take the values 1,2,⋯,n{\displaystyle 1,2,\cdots ,n}, and the inner product of vectors can be written as a⋅b=∑i,j=1naiδijbj=∑i=1naibi.{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} =\sum _{i,j=1}^{n}a_{i}\delta _{ij}b_{j}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}b_{i}.} Here the Euclidean vectors are defined as n-tuples: a=(a1,a2,…,an){\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =(a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{n})} and b=(b1,b2,...,bn){\displaystyle \mathbf {b} =(b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n})} and the last step is obtained by using the values of the Kronecker delta to reduce the summation over j{\displaystyle j}. It is common for i and j to be restricted to a set of the form {1, 2, ..., n} or {0, 1, ..., n − 1}, but the Kronecker delta can be defined on an arbitrary set.
