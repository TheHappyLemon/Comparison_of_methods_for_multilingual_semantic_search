Fudbalski klub Napredak Kruševac (Serbian Cyrillic: Фудбалски клуб Напредак Крушевац), commonly known as Napredak Kruševac, is a Serbian professional football club based in the city of Kruševac. The word Napredak means "progress" in Serbian. The club's nickname is the Čarapani which translates in English to the sock-men, the origin of this nickname are from the times of the First Serbian Uprising, when the local insurgents took off their slippers and silently went to defend their homeland against the Ottoman occupation of Serbia, in socks. Another interpretation is related to the custom of men in this area who in urban legend in medieval times wore beautiful, long embroidered socks.
