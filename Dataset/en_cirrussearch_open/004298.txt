The knockout stage of the 2010 FIBA World Championship commenced play on 4 September 2010. The teams that finished fourth or higher at their respective preliminary round groups qualify for the knockout stage; the knockout stage is a modified single-elimination tournament, with a thirdâ€“place game for the losers of the semifinals. The teams played all of their games at Sinan Erdem Dome, Istanbul, Turkey. Eliminated teams at the quarterfinals played for fifth to eighth places, the loser of the first round play for seventh place, while the winners play for fifth place. In order to give each contest more ticket sales, more TV coverage and more media coverage, the Local Organizing Committee proposed the measure to FIBA to extend the eighth-finals (round of 16)'s schedule to last four days instead of the previously done two days as was done in Saitama. FIBA accepted the proposal.
