This is a list of the largest cities in the European Union according to the population within their city boundary. The cities listed all have populations over 300,000. The list deals exclusively with the areas within city administrative boundaries as opposed to urban areas or larger urban zones (metropolitan areas), which are generally larger in terms of population than the main city. As some cities have a very narrow boundary and others a very wide one, the list may not give an accurate view of the comparative magnitude of entire urban areas, and thus the figures in the list should be treated with caution. For example Paris is the most populous urban area in the European Union, however the city proper of the French capital has a lower population than top ranked Berlin and a couple of other cities, as shown in the table. Likewise the City of Brussels is only one of a total of 19 municipalities making up the greater Brussels Capital Region, and by itself does not reach the population threshold to be listed here. While this phenomenon is partially due to different approaches to local government and administration in different countries, differences may be stark even within the same country; the city of Dresden is actually slightly larger by area than the city of Munich but contains just over a third the inhabitants - a figure which in the case of Munich excludes the relatively densely populated Landkreis MÃ¼nchen which surrounds Munich on three sides and is home to another 350000 inhabitants - albeit on twice the area of Munich proper.
