The Ferencváros Stadion, also known as the Groupama Aréna for sponsorship purposes, is a multi-purpose stadium in Ferencváros, Budapest, Hungary and the home of Ferencvárosi TC. With a capacity of 22,000, it was for a time the largest stadium in Hungary (between the demolition of the larger Ferenc Puskás Stadium in 2017 and the opening of the Puskás Aréna in November 2019). It was built on the site of the former Flórián Albert Stadium, the club's previous home, which was demolished in 2013. The French insurance group Groupama purchased the naming rights to the stadium. However, the name cannot be used when hosting FIFA and UEFA events, since these governing bodies have policies forbidding corporate sponsorship from companies that are not official tournament partners.
