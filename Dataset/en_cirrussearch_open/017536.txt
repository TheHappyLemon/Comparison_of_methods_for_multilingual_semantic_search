Raspberry Pi (/paÉª/) is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom. Since 2013, Raspberry Pi devices have been developed and supported by a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, now named Raspberry Pi Ltd. The Raspberry Pi project originally leaned toward the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools. The original model became more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for diverse uses such as robotics, home and industrial automation, and by computer and electronic hobbyists, because of its low cost, modularity, open design, and its adoption of the HDMI and USB standards. After the release of the second board type, the Raspberry Pi Foundation set up a new entity, named Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd, and installed Eben Upton as CEO, with the responsibility for developing their computers. The Foundation was rededicated as an educational charity for promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries. Most Raspberry Pis are made in a Sony factory in Pencoed, Wales, while others are made in China and Japan. In 2015, the Raspberry Pi surpassed the ZX Spectrum in unit sales, becoming the best-selling British computer. In 2021, Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd changed its name to Raspberry Pi Ltd.
