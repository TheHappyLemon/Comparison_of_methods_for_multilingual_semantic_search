All in Good Taste (originally known as It's All in Good Taste) is a Canadian comedy film, which was produced in 1981 but not shown in theaters until 1983. The film was produced, directed and cowritten by Anthony Kramreither, who was inspired by his own experience as a producer whose creative ambitions had been eclipsed by a commercial imperative to keep his Brightstar Pictures studio operating by making low-budget B-movies.
