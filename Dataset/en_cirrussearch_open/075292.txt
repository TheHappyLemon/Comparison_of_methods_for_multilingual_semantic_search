Estline (sometimes spelled EstLine) was a Swedish-Estonian shipping company, owned jointly by Nordström & Thulin and the Estonian Government via Estonian Shipping Company (ESCO). Estline was founded in 1989, and had a 10 year exclusive right to the passenger traffic between Stockholm, Sweden and Tallinn, Estonia. On 28 September 1994, the flagship of the company, MS Estonia, sank in an autumn storm. In 1998, Nordström & Thulin left the joint venture, making Estline a fully owned Estonian shipping company. By the end of 2000, Estline's ships were chartered by Tallink. Estline was officially declared bankrupt in the middle of year 2001.
