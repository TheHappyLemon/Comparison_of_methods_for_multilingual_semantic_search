In mathematics, the set of positive real numbers, R>0={x∈R∣x>0},{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{>0}=\left\{x\in \mathbb {R} \mid x>0\right\},} is the subset of those real numbers that are greater than zero. The non-negative real numbers, R≥0={x∈R∣x≥0},{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{\geq 0}=\left\{x\in \mathbb {R} \mid x\geq 0\right\},} also include zero. Although the symbols R+{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{+}} and R+{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{+}} are ambiguously used for either of these, the notation R+{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{+}} or R+{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{+}} for {x∈R∣x≥0}{\displaystyle \left\{x\in \mathbb {R} \mid x\geq 0\right\}} and R+∗{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{+}^{*}} or R∗+{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{*}^{+}} for {x∈R∣x>0}{\displaystyle \left\{x\in \mathbb {R} \mid x>0\right\}} has also been widely employed, is aligned with the practice in algebra of denoting the exclusion of the zero element with a star, and should be understandable to most practicing mathematicians. In a complex plane, R>0{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{>0}} is identified with the positive real axis, and is usually drawn as a horizontal ray. This ray is used as reference in the polar form of a complex number. The real positive axis corresponds to complex numbers z=|z|eiφ,{\displaystyle z=|z|\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \varphi },} with argument φ=0.{\displaystyle \varphi =0.}
