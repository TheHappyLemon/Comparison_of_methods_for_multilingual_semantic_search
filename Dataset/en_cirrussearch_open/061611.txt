The Chott el Hodna (Arabic: شط الحضنة) is a very shallow saline lake in Algeria. It is located within an endorheic basin in the Hodna region, towards the eastern end of the Hautes Plaines. The Chott el Hodna includes seasonal brackish and saline pools and marshes, but the central zone of the lake is characterized by a complete absence of vegetation. J. Despois argues that the Chott el Hodna is not a proper Chott, but a Sebkha.
