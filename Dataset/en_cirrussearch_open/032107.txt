The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Dominica accepted the convention on April 4, 1995, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Dominica has only one World Heritage Site, Morne Trois Pitons National Park, which was inscribed in 1997.
