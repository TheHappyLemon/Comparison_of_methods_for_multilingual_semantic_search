A spitz (the name derives from the German word spitz, (German: [ʃpɪt͡s] ) meaning "pointed", in reference to the pointed muzzle) is a type of domestic dog consisting of between 50 and 70 breeds depending on classification. There is no precise definition of 'spitz' but typically most spitz breeds have pricked ears, almond shaped eyes, a pointed muzzle, a double coat, and a tail that curves over the back. The exact origins of spitz dogs remain unknown, though most of the spitzes seen today originate from the Arctic region or from Siberia.[citation needed] Johann Friedrich Gmelin described the type as Canis pomeranus in his 1788 revision of Systema Naturae.
