Zengő (Hungarian: [ˈzɛŋɡøː]; Croatian: Zenka) is the highest mountain in Mecsek Mountains in southern Hungary – its height is 682 metres. The peak is situated in the southeastern part of the range. On its top, along with a look-out tower, stand the ruins of a small medieval castle, which was probably built on the site of an earlier guard tower of the Roman Empire. The peak can be most easily reached from Pécsvárad or Hosszúhetény.
