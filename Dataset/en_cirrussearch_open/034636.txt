Sempiternal is the fourth studio album by British rock band Bring Me the Horizon. It was released on 1 April 2013 worldwide through RCA Records, a subsidiary label of Sony Music, and 2 April 2013 in the United States and Canada through Epitaph Records. It is the first album to feature former Worship keyboardist Jordan Fish and the first with guitarist Lee Malia playing both lead and rhythm components. Written and recorded throughout 2012, Sempiternal showed the band pull diverse influences from nu metal, electronic music, ambient music and pop. "Sempiternal" is an archaic English word denoting the concept of "everlasting time" that can never actually come to pass. It stems from the Latin word "sempiternus" (a concatenation of root "semper" and suffix "aeternum"). The album spawned four singles ("Shadow Moses"; "Sleepwalking"; "Go to Hell, for Heaven's Sake"; and "Can You Feel My Heart"). The album made its debut at No. 3 on the UK Album Chart and is their second successive album to top the ARIA Charts in Australia. It also managed to reach No. 11 on the US Billboard 200 with 27,522 first week sales, making Sempiternal the band's highest charting album in America until That's the Spirit debuted at No. 2 in 2015. Upon its release, the album received critical acclaim.
