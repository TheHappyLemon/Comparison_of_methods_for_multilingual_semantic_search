The channel delivers its signal via satellites in four orbits, which allow its 27 television stations to receive it in their corresponding time zones. The signal is received and redistributed by local stations broadcasting in most large cities and 5,900 smaller communities in the Russian Federation. TNT reserves the rights to all original shows and owns two of Russia's largest production companies: Comedy Club Production and Good Story Media. It also has exclusive contracts with a number of Russian showrunners. Since 2016, TNT has been directed by Artur Janibekyan (head of Gazprom-Media Entertainment TV). In February 2022, Tina Kandelaki was named channel`s interim CEO as a substitute for Roman Petrenko, the new adviser to Gazprom-Media CEO.
