The state emblem of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani: Az…ôrbaycan gerbi) mixes traditional and modern symbols. The focal point of the emblem is a stylized flame. The flame is a reference to Azerbaijan's eternal natural oil-gas resources, which has given it the nickname "land of eternal fire". The emblem is supported by a crossed stalk of wheat and an oak bough. Wheat is the symbol of abundance in Azerbaijan. Also, wheat bread is the main staple food. The oak tree is the symbol of power and youth in time.
