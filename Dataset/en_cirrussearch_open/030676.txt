The Baltic Defense (also known as the Grau Defense, or the Sahovic Defense) is a chess opening characterized by the moves: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 Bf5!? The Baltic is an unusual variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD). In most defenses to the QGD, Black has difficulties developing her queen bishop. This opening takes a radical approach to the problem by bringing out the queen bishop immediately. The Baltic has not found widespread acceptance among chess masters, but some world-class players have used it including grandmasters Paul Keres and Alexei Shirov. The ECO code for the Baltic Defense is D06. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
