Phoenix is the seventh studio album released by American punk rock band Zebrahead. Shawn Harris of The Matches created the artwork for the album, as he did with the band's previous album Broadcast to the World. Phoenix was made available for streaming via Fuse's website on July 31, 2008, before being released on August 5, 2008 through Icon Mes. The band was due to embark on a US tour in August and September 2008, but had to cancel it when frontman Matty Lewis started suffering from vocal issues. They ended up going on a tour of mainland Europe in October 2008.
