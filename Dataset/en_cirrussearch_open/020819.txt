Bad Muskau (German pronunciation: [ˌbaːt ˈmʊskaʊ]; formerly Muskau, Upper Sorbian: Mužakow [ˈmuʒakɔf], Polish: Mużaków, Czech: Mužakov) is a spa town in the historic Upper Lusatia region in Germany, at the border with Poland. It is part of the Görlitz district in the State of Saxony. It is located on the banks of the Lusatian Neisse river. The town is part of the recognized Sorbian settlement area in Saxony. Upper Sorbian has an official status next to German, with all villages bearing names in both languages. The town of Lugknitz, formerly incorporated into Bad Muskau, was separated in 1945 by the new state border drawn along the Oder–Neisse line. Muskau Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is similarly split with the municipality containing its western half. Bad Muskau gained worldwide fame through prince and landscape artist Hermann von Pückler-Muskau, who created a unique cultural asset with his landscape park.
