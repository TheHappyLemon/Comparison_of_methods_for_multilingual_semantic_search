2023 in film is an overview of events, including award ceremonies, festivals, a list of country- and genre-specific lists of films released, and notable deaths. Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Studios celebrated their 100th anniversaries in 2023. A huge number of the year's films significantly underperformed at the box office, attributed to high budgets and low marketing due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. In particular, many superhero films (except Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse) released this year were poorly received and/or bombed at the box office; this pattern of increasing decline and/or rejection of the genre (which, to many, had saturated the motion picture market) was named “superhero fatigue”.[citation needed]
