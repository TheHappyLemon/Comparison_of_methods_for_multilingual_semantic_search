Stephen McClaren (born 3 May 1961) is an English former professional footballer and coach who currently serves as an assistant coach for Premier League club Manchester United, in his second spell at the club. McClaren began his coaching career with Oxford United, before joining Derby County in 1995. In 1999, McClaren was hired by Manchester United as Brian Kidd's replacement as Alex Ferguson's assistant manager. He held that position for two years, until he was hired as manager of Middlesbrough. During his tenure, Middlesbrough won their first (and thus far only) major trophy, the League Cup in 2004. They were also UEFA Cup runners-up in 2006. He was appointed manager of the England national team in August 2006, but was dismissed a year later after England failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008, and was the subject of strong media criticism. In 2008, McClaren was appointed manager of Dutch club Twente, with whom he won the club's first ever Eredivisie championship in 2010. Soon afterwards, he took over at VfL Wolfsburg in Germany, though he was dismissed mid-season due to poor results. After a short spell as manager of Nottingham Forest, he returned to Twente in 2012. His second stint with Twente was less successful than his first, however, and McClaren resigned in early 2013. He returned to Derby later that year, leading the club to the play-offs in the 2013â€“14 season, but failed to win promotion and he was dismissed in 2015. He was soon appointed as head coach of Newcastle United, but was dismissed after less than year after winning only six of his 28 Premier League matches in charge. He had a second spell as Derby manager from October 2016 to March 2017 and in 2018, McClaren was appointed manager of Queens Park Rangers, before being dismissed in April 2019.
