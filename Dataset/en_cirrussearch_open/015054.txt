Amsler Island is a small island off the south coast of Anvers Island in the Palmer Archipelago of Antarctica. It sits between Loudwater Cove and Arthur Harbour. The island is a roughly triangular rocky plot of granite land approximately 2.1 km (1.3 mi) long and 1 km (0.6 mi) wide at its widest point. Narrow Norsel Point, formerly considered a headland of Arthur Harbour, marks its westernmost extremity.
