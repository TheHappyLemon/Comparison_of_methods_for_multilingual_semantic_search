The coat of arms of Brazil (Portuguese: Brasão de Armas do Brasil) was created on 19 November 1889, four days after Brazil became a republic. It consists of the central emblem surrounded by coffee (Coffea arabica, at the left) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, at the right) branches, which were important crops in Brazil at that time. In the round shield in the center, the Southern Cross (Cruzeiro do Sul) can be seen. The ring of 27 stars around it represents Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District. The blue ribbon contains the official name of Brazil, República Federativa do Brasil — Federative Republic of Brazil, in its first line. Prior to 1964, this line contained the previous official name, Estados Unidos do Brasil — United States of Brazil. In the second line, the date of the proclamation of the Republic (15 November 1889) is written.
