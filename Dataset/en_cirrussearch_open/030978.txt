The Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack (also known as the Nimzo-Larsen Attack, Larsen's Opening and Queen's Fianchetto Opening) is a chess opening typically starting with the move: 1.b3 but sometimes introduced by the move order 1.Nf3 and then 2.b3. The flank opening move 1.b3 prepares to fianchetto the queen's bishop where it will help control the central squares in hypermodern fashion and put pressure on Black's kingside. Lines are classified under codes A01â€“A06 in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings.
