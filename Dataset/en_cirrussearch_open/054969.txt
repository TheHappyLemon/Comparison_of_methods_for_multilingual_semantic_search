Smurfs: The Lost Village is a 2017 American animated fantasy adventure comedy film based on The Smurfs comic series by Peyo, produced by Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, The Kerner Entertainment Company, and Wanda Pictures, in association with LStar Capital, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. A reboot to Sony's previous live-action/animated hybrid films and the third and final installment in Sony's Smurfs film series, the film was directed by Kelly Asbury from a screenplay written by Stacey Harman and Pamela Ribon, and stars the voices of Demi Lovato, Rainn Wilson, Joe Manganiello, Mandy Patinkin, Jack McBrayer, Danny Pudi, Michelle Rodriguez, Ellie Kemper, Jake Johnson, Ariel Winter, Meghan Trainor, and Julia Roberts. In the film, a mysterious map prompts Smurfette, Brainy, Clumsy, and Hefty to find a lost village before Gargamel does. The film introduced the female Smurfs, who appeared in the franchise the following year. Smurfs: The Lost Village premiered on April 2, 2017 and was released in the United States on April 7, 2017. The film received mixed reviews from critics (although some considered it an improvement over the previous two films), and was not as successful as its two predecessors, grossing over $197 million worldwide against a $60 million budget, but still a commercial success. The movie is dedicated to Jonathan Winters, the voice actor of both Grandpa Smurf from the 1980s animated series and Papa Smurf from the original movie series who died on 2013, Anton Yelchin, the voice actor of Clumsy Smurf, and Nine Culliford, the wife of Peyo, who both died in 2016. This is the last Smurfs movie to be distributed by Sony Pictures, as Paramount Pictures would later acquire the film rights to the franchise in 2021 to produce an upcoming Smurfs musical film, set for release on February 14, 2025.
