Adler (Russian: Адлер) is a resort on the Black Sea coast located in the mouth of the Mzymta River. It used to be a town but is now a microdistrict within Adlersky City District of Sochi, Krasnodar Krai, Russia. It hosts a railway station on the North Caucasus railway, which became the terminus after the Georgian–Abkhazian conflict broke the railway.
