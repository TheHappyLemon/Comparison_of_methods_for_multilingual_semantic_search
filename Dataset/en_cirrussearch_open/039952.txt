The Weeping Angels are a race of predatory creatures from the long-running science fiction series Doctor Who. They were introduced in the 2007 episode "Blink", making repeat appearances in later episodes. They also appeared in the spin-off series Class. Since their initial appearance, they have been persistently nominated as one of the most popular and frightening Doctor Who monsters. Steven Moffat attributes their appeal to childhood games such as Grandmother's Footsteps and the notion that every statue might secretly be a disguised Weeping Angel.
