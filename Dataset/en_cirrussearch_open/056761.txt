Võru railway station (Estonian: Võru raudteejaam) is a now closed train station located in Võru, Estonia. There is no passenger rail service to the station as of 2014. There was hope of having passenger trains stop at the station, but in 2010, the Estonian railways said they were not interested. Regardless, the station would have to be upgraded to meet current standards; it sits in disrepair with the windows boarded up. In 2015, a project by Estonian director Anna Hints consisting of interviews with survivors of the Soviet deportations was installed in the station as part of Estonia's Kilometre of Sculpture festival.
