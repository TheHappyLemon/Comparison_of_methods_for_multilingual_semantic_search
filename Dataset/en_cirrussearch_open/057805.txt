"Un premier amour" (French pronunciation: [œ̃ pʁəmjɛʁ‿amuʁ]; "A First Love") was the winning song of the Eurovision Song Contest 1962, sung in French by Isabelle Aubret representing France. The song was performed ninth on the night, following the Netherlands' De Spelbrekers with "Katinka" and preceding Norway's Inger Jacobsen with "Kom sol, kom regn". By the close of voting, it had received 26 points, placing it first in a field of 16. The song is a typically dramatic ballad, with Aubret singing about the power that a first love has over people. The song was succeeded as contest winner in 1963 by "Dansevise" performed by Grethe & Jørgen Ingmann representing Denmark. It was succeeded as French representative that year by Alain Barrière with "Elle était si jolie". Isabelle Aubret returned to the Contest in 1968, again representing France, singing "La source", placing third with 20 points, behind winner Massiel with "La, la, la" and runner-up Cliff Richard with "Congratulations".
