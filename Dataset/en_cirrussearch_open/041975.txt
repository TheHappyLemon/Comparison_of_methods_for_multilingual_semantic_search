Miina Härma (born Miina Hermann; February 9, 1864 – November 16, 1941) was an Estonian composer. She was the second Estonian musician with higher education. Her greatest contribution is perhaps the fact that she took organ music to the countryside, as virtually no skilled organists gave concerts outside of towns. During her 60-year creative career, she wrote more than 200 choral songs, 10 cavatinas, a canto, "Kalev and Linda" and much more. She composed mainly vocal music.
