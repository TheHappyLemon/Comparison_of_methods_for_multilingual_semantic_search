Sverdlovsk (Ukrainian: Свердловськ; Russian: Свердловск) or Dovzhansk (Ukrainian: Довжанськ) is an industrial city in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine, near the internationally recognized border with Russia. It is located approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the administrative center of the oblast, Luhansk. Its population is estimated to be 62,691 (2022 estimate). Sverdlovsk has its origins in several mining settlements that appeared in the late 18th century and 19th century. They were united into a single city in 1938, which grew over time despite destructive occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II. It has been controlled by the Luhansk People's Republic since 2014.
