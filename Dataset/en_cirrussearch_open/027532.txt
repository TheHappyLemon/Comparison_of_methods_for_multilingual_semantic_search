The Rennes Metro (French: Métro de Rennes) (Breton: Metro Roazhon) is a light metro system serving the city of Rennes in Brittany, France. Opened on 19 March 2002, it made Rennes the smallest city in the world to have a metro system from 2002 to 2008. Currently the system contains two lines, Line A and B. It has 28 stations and stretches 23.5 kilometres (14.6 mi), with the majority of its route underground. Line A connects the quarter of Villejean to the quarter of Poterie, passing the city center. It is based on the Siemens VAL (véhicule automatique léger or light automatic vehicle in English) technology. In 2023, approximately 145,000 trips a day were made on Line A, and 80,000 on Line B. A second line, Line B, is opened on 20 September 2022. Running north-east to south-west between Cesson-Sévigné and Saint-Jacques-de-la-Lande, it also has 15 stations, two of them interchangeable with Line A, forming an x-shaped network. It will be the first metro line in the world to use the NeoVal technology. Originally planned to open in 2020, the line suffered multiple delays, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After the opening of Line B, Rennes became the smallest city with two metro lines.
