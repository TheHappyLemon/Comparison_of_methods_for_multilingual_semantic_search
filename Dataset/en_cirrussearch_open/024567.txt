South Khorasan Province (Persian: استان خراسان جنوبی Ostān-e Khorāsān-e Jonūbī) is one of the 31 provinces of Iran, located in the eastern part of the country. Birjand is the centre and capital of the province. At the time of the National Census of 2006, the province had a population of 600,568 in 159,255 households. The following census in 2011 counted 662,534 people in 183,114 households. In 2014, it was placed in Region 5. At the most recent census in 2016, the population of South Khorasan province had risen to 768,898 in 223,984 households. This new province, is but the old Quhistan which was included into greater Khorasan in the Iranian administrative planning. However, historically Qohistan forms a separate entity, with a distinct culture, history, environment and ecology. South Khorasan is one of the three provinces that were created after the division of Khorasan in 2004. While at the beginning, the newly created "South Khorasan" included only Birjand County and some new counties detached from that county (i.e. Nehbandan, Darmian and Sarbisheh), in subsequent years, all northern and western cities and territories of the old Quhistan (such as Qaen, Ferdows and Tabas) have been annexed into South Khorasan, which as of 2016 consists of 11 counties.
