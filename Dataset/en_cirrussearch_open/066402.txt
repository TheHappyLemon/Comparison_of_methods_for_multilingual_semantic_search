The "Russian world" (Russian: Русский мир, romanized: Russkiy mir, lit. 'Russian world', 'Russian order', 'Russian community') is a concept and a political doctrine usually defined as the sphere of military, political and cultural influence of Russia. This concept is sometimes also phrased as Pax Russica, in parallel to the Pax Romana, and as a counterweight to the Pax Britannica of the nineteenth century and the Pax Americana after WWII.
