The Ananke group is a group of retrograde irregular satellites of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Ananke and are thought to have a common origin. Their semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) range between 19.2 and 21.8 Gm, their orbital inclinations between 144.3° and 155.5°, and their orbital eccentricities between 0.09 and 0.30. The members of the Ananke group are: The International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names ending in -e for all retrograde moons, including this group's members.
