SpaceX CRS-20 (CRS-20), also known as SpaceX-20, was a Commercial Resupply Service mission to the International Space Station (ISS) launched on 7 March 2020. The mission was contracted by NASA and was flown by SpaceX using Dragon. This was SpaceX's last flight for Dragon 1 and concluded the NASA Commercial Resupply Services (CRS-1) contract extension. The twenty (20) missions by SpaceX under the CRS-1 contract carried more than 43,000 kg (94,000 pounds) of cargo to the International Space Station, and returned about 33,000 kg (74,000 pounds) of equipment and specimens to Earth, according to NASA. The second contract (CRS-2) was awarded in January 2016 and began with the SpaceX CRS-21 in December 2020 using Dragon 2. The Dragon capsule C112 used for CRS-20 previously flew to the ISS on CRS-10 and CRS-16. It arrived at the ISS on 9 March 2020 at 10:25 UTC and was captured by the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm, the last capture of a Dragon with Canadarm2. Cargo Dragon 2 vehicles, which will replace Dragon 1, will dock directly at the space station. The 1st stage booster B1059 previously supported the CRS-19 mission.
