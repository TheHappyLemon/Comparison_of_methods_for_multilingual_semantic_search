The province of Málaga (Spanish: Provincia de Málaga [ˈmalaɣa]) is located in Andalusia, Spain. It is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the south and by the provinces of Cádiz to the west, Seville to the northwest, Córdoba to the north, and Granada to the east. The province is subject to extreme water stress in the wake of the proliferation of avocado plantations in the Axarquía region, with the arid local climate being unsuitable to the plant's large water demands.
