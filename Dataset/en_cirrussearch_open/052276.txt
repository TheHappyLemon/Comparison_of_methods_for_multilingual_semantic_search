Football Club Dnipro (Ukrainian: Футбо́льний Клуб «Дніпро́», IPA: [d(j)n(j)iˈprɔ] ) was a Ukrainian football club based in Dnipro. The club played its last season in the 2018–19 Ukrainian Amateur League. The club was owned by Ihor Kolomoyskyi. In 2018 FC Dnipro was forced into bankruptcy by FIFA due to multiple legal claims for failing to pay the promised monetary compensation to players and managers. SC Dnipro-1 currently exists as a unofficial successor. The club was founded in 1918. During the Soviet era, the club was a member of the Soviet Volunteer Sports Society "Metallurg" (therefore it carried names Metallurg/Metalurh and Stal) and until 1961 was under sponsorship of the Petrovsky Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Plant. After that, the club was sponsored by the Southern Machine-building Plant Yuzhmash and carried both names Russian Dnepr and Ukrainian Dnipro, while Dnepr was also used for international competitions. During the Soviet era, the club was the second most successful club, based in Ukraine, that participated in the Soviet Top League, winning in 1983 and 1988. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the club was privatized.
