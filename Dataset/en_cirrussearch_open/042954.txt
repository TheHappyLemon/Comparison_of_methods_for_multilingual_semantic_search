Dęblin [ˈdɛmblʲin] is a town at the confluence of Vistula and Wieprz rivers, in Lublin Voivodeship, Poland. Dęblin is the part of the agglomeration with adjacent towns of Ryki and Puławy, which altogether has over 100 000 inhabitants. The population of the town itself is 15,505 (December 2021). Dęblin is part of the historic region of Lesser Poland. Since 1927 it has been the home of the chief Polish Air Force Academy (Polish: Lotnicza Akademia Wojskowa), and as such Dęblin is one of the most important places associated with aviation in Poland. The town is also a key railroad junction, located along the major Berlin – Warsaw line, with two additional connections stemming from Dęblin – one westwards to Radom, and another one northeast to Łuków.
