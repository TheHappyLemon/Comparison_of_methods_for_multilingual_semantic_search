Victor Rask (born 1 March 1993) is a Swedish professional ice hockey center who is currently playing with the SC Rapperswil-Jona Lakers of the National League (NL) after he spent eight years in the National Hockey League (NHL), playing for the Carolina Hurricanes, Minnesota Wild, and Seattle Kraken. Born and raised in Leksand, Sweden, Rask began his playing career with Leksands IF of the then Swedish HockeyAllsvenskan. Following the 2010–11 HockeyAllsvenskan season, in which he tallied five goals and six assists, Rask was drafted by two North American organizations. He was first drafted by the Carolina Hurricanes in the second round (42nd overall) of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft and then taken by the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in the 2011 CHL Import Draft. Rask chose to begin his major junior hockey with the Hitmen during the 2011–12 season and played two full seasons in the WHL before officially joining the Hurricanes organization. Rask made his NHL debut for the Hurricanes during the 2014–15 season and matched numerous franchise records. With a record of 11 goals and 22 assists through 78 games, he became the sixth rookie in Hurricanes history to hit the 30-point milestone. Rask also joined a franchise record by becoming one of five Hurricanes rookies to score 10 or more goals in a season since the team’s relocation to Raleigh. On 17 January 2019, Rask was traded by the Hurricanes to the Minnesota Wild in exchange for winger Nino Niederreiter. After playing with the team for nearly four seasons, Rask was traded by the Wild to the Seattle Kraken for future considerations in 2022.
