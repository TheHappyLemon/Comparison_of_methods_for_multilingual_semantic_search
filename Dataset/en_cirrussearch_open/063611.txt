Look at Me: The Album is the only compilation album by American rapper and singer XXXTentacion. Announced alongside a documentary of the same name, the album was released posthumously on June 10, 2022, 8 days before the fourth anniversary of his death. Look at Me was supported by two singles: "Vice City" and "True Love", both of which were announced early on, being previously absent from streaming services due to sample clearance problems. The album features both Ski Mask the Slump God and Kanye West.
