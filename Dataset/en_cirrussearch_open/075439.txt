The Prince of Novgorod (Russian: князь новгородский, romanized: knyaz novgorodsky) was the title of the ruler of Novgorod in present-day Russia. From 1136, it was the title of the figurehead leader of the Novgorod Republic. The position was originally an appointed one until the late 11th or early 12th century, then became something of an elective one until the early 14th century, after which the grand prince of Vladimir (who was almost always the prince of Moscow) was almost invariably the prince of Novgorod as well. The title originates sometime in the 9th century when, according to tradition, the Varangian chieftain Rurik and his brothers were invited to rule over the East Slavic and Finnic tribes of northwest Russia, but reliable information about it dates only to the late 10th century when Vladimir, the youngest son of Sviatoslav I, was made the prince of Novgorod. During the reign of Ivan III, the title was restored and Novgorod was included in the title of the Russian monarch, which lasted until the abdication of Nicholas II of Russia in 1917. After Novgorod was formally annexed by Moscow in 1478, Ivan assumed the title of sovereign of all Russia.
