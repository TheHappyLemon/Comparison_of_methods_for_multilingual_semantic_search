Ulf Niklas Alexander Edler (born 21 April 1986) is a Swedish professional ice hockey defenceman who is an unrestricted free agent. He previously played for the Vancouver Canucks and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted out of Sweden's third-tier ice hockey league by the Canucks in the third round, 91st overall, in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft, and played junior ice hockey with Modo Hockey of the J20 SuperElit and the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League (WHL). Edler turned professional in North America with the Canucks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, in 2006–07, seeing some time in the NHL over the course of the season. He became a full-time member of the Canucks the following season, and has since been named to one NHL All-Star Game (2012). Having played in games for the Canucks in 2006–07, he was the longest tenured player on the team's lineup following the retirement of the Sedin twins, Daniel and Henrik, until the Kings acquired him in 2021. Internationally, Edler has competed for Sweden on four occasions: at the 2006 World Junior Championships, the 2008 and 2013 IIHF World Championships (winning gold) and the 2014 Winter Olympics (winning silver). Edler is an offensive defenceman noted for his calm on-ice demeanor and strong slapshot. Edler is regarded as one of the best Canucks defencemen of all time, holding franchise records for most goals, assists, and points scored by a defenceman for the Canucks.
