Tatra T6B5 is a Czechoslovak-built high floor four axle tram with a pulse-width-modulation ('chopper') speed control. This model of tram was produced by CKD Praha in Smíchov, Prague in the period of 1983–1995, following one year in Zličín until 1996. After ČKD Praha went bankrupt, the final assembly and sale of incomplete trams were managed by Inekon Trams until 2007. The last four trams were supplied to the city of Ufa by late 2007. About 1,150 tramcars of this model were produced. In the former Soviet Union, it is also known as Т-3М. In 2015 most of these trams were used in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.
