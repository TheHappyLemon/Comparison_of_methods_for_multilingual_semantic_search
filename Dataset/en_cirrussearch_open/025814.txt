The Nokia 6630 is a 3G mobile phone announced by Nokia on 14 June 2004 and released in November. It runs on Symbian OS 8.0a (Series 60 2nd Edition FP2). Codenamed Charlie during development, it is an evolution of the 6600 and 6620 smartphones, supporting tri-band GSM (run on lower operating systems). The Nokia 6630 is the first phone ever that allows truly global roaming; previously GSM phones have had near-global coverage except in Japan where 2G phone standards were different. The 6630 automatically uses the W-CDMA network in Japan. Nokia 6650 and 7600 were also able to function in Japan, but they did not support GSM 1900, often needed in the United States and Canada (the Nokia 6651 has the GSM 1900). Nokia says the Nokia 6630 is the first dual-mode, tri-band handset designed to work on 3G (WCDMA), EDGE and 2G networks in Europe, Asia and the Americas. In September 2005, Nokia introduced a 6630 "Music Edition" which retailed for 500 euros.
