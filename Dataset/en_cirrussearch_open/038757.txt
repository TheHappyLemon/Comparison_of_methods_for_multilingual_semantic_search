This is a list of Dalai Lamas of Tibet. There have been 14 recognised incarnations of the Dalai Lama. There has also been one non-recognised Dalai Lama, Ngawang Yeshe Gyatso (declared in 1707), by Lha-bzang Khan as the "true" 6th Dalai Lama â€“ however, he was never accepted as such by the majority of the Tibetan people.
