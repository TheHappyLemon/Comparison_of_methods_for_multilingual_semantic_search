The Baltic Ice Lake is a name given by geologists to a freshwater lake that evolved in the Baltic Sea basin as glaciers retreated from that region at the end of the last ice age. The lake existed between 12,600 and 10,300 years Before Present (BP). The Baltic Ice Lake is one of a number of water stages that eventually resulted in the modern Baltic Sea. After the Baltic Ice Lake came the Yoldia Sea (10,300–9,500 BP), the Ancylus Lake (9,500–8,000 BP), the Mastogloia Sea (8,000–7,500 BP), the Littorina Sea (7,500–4,000 BP) and finally the Baltic Sea (4,000 BP–present day).
