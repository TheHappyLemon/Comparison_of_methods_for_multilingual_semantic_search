A Serbian Film (Serbian: Српски филм/Srpski film) is a 2010 Serbian exploitation horror film produced and directed by Srđan Spasojević in his feature directorial debut, with Aleksandar Radivojević co-writing. It tells the experience of a financially struggling pornstar who agrees to participate in an "art film", only to discover that he has been drafted into a snuff film with pedophilic and necrophilic themes. The film stars Serbian actors Srđan Todorović, Sergej Trifunović, and Jelena Gavrilović. Upon its debut on the art film circuit, A Serbian Film received substantial attention and controversy for its depictions of graphic violence and sexual content. The film has been banned in several countries including the Philippines, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, and Norway, and was temporarily banned from screening in Brazil. It also required compulsory cuts in order to be released in the United Kingdom and received an NC-17 rating in the United States. The film's notoriety has continued to the present day, and a number of sources have described A Serbian Film as the single most disturbing movie of all time.
