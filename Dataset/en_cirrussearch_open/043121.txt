The Great Fire of Bucharest (Romanian: Marele incendiu din Bucure»ôti or simply Focul cel mare) was the largest conflagration ever to occur in Bucharest, Romania, then the capital of Wallachia. It started on 23 March 1847 and destroyed 1850 buildings, a third of the city, including, according to Prince Gheorghe Bibescu, "the most populated and richest part of Bucharest". The fire destroyed the central commercial part of the city, replacing the small and crowded wooden buildings with two-story brick merchants' and craftsmen's houses, inspired by those in Austria, having their shops and warehouses at the first floor and the habitation at the second floor.
