Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCA), now part of Stellantis, was an Italian-American multinational corporation primarily known as a manufacturer of automobiles, commercial vehicles, auto parts and production systems. At the time[when?] it was the world's eighth largest automobile maker. The group was established in 2014 through the merger of Chrysler Group and Fiat S.p.A. Its corporate headquarters were domiciled in Amsterdam and its financial headquarters were in London. The holding company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Milan's Borsa Italiana. Exor, an Italian investment group controlled by the Agnelli family, owned 29% of FCA and controlled 44% through a loyalty voting mechanism, the largest block of shares. FCA's mass-market brands operated through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat) with headquarters in Turin, and FCA US (previously Chrysler) in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The company's portfolio included brands Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, and Ram Trucks. Ferrari was spun off in 2016. FCA operated in four global markets (NAFTA, LATAM, APAC, EMEA). Starting in late 2019, FCA merged with the PSA Group (owner of the Peugeot and CitroÃ«n brands among others) on a 50-50 all-stock basis in a $50 billion merger. In 2020, the company announced its new name, Stellantis. In January 2021, the merger was complete with FCA resulting as the surviving entity and changed its name to Stellantis. FCA also owned industrial subsidiaries Comau, Mopar, Teksid and VM Motori.
