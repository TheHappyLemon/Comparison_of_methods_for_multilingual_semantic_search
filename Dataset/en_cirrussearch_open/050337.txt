The Russian occupation of Crimea is an ongoing military occupation of the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. It began on 27 February 2014, when unmarked Russian special forces were deployed in Crimea; although the Ukrainian government considers it to have begun on 20 February. The occupation of Crimea was the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The occupation began during Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, which ousted pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. Russian special forces without insignia took control of Crimea's government buildings, surrounded Ukrainian military bases, and blockaded the peninsula. A pro-Russian government was installed and a referendum on Crimea's status was held under occupation. According to the Russian-installed authorities, the result was in favor of joining Russia. It annexed Crimea on 18 March 2014, creating the Russian Republic of Crimea and federal city of Sevastopol. From the outset of its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia has used Crimea as a base from which to attack mainland Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has responded with attacks on Russian forces in Crimea. One of Russia's preconditions for ending its invasion is the recognition of its annexation of Crimea, while one of Ukraine's goals is to liberate the territory, by military means if necessary.
