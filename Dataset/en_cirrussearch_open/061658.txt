Zoran Tošić (Serbian Cyrillic: Зоран Тошић, pronounced [zǒran tǒʃitɕ, - tôː-]; born 28 April 1987) is a Serbian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Greek Super League club Lamia. He has built a reputation as a free-kick specialist and a tricky dribbler. Tošić began his career with his local side Proleter Zrenjanin, before making his debuts with Mladost Lukićevo. He then joined Budućnost Banatski Dvor, who then merged with Proleter to form Banat Zrenjanin. A year later, he signed for Serbian giants Partizan, for whom he played for two years before a high-profile move to Manchester United of England. After he struggled to break into the Red Devils first-team, he was sent on a six-month loan to German side 1. FC Köln in January 2010, and was then transferred to CSKA Moscow of Russia that summer. A full international between 2007 and 2016 , Tošić has earned 76 caps for Serbia. He was part of their teams at the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2010 World Cup.
