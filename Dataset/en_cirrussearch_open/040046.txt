A rapier (/ˈreɪpiər/) or espada ropera ('dress sword') is a type of sword used in Renaissance Spain to designate a sword with a straight, slender and sharply pointed two-edged long blade wielded in one hand. It was widely popular in Western Europe throughout the 16th and 17th centuries as a symbol of nobility or gentleman status. It is called espada ropera because it was carried as an accessory to clothing, generally used for fashion and as a weapon for dueling, self-defense and as a military side arm. Its name is of Spanish origin and appears recorded for the first time in the Coplas de la panadera, by Juan de Mena, written approximately between 1445 and 1450: Say, baker. A Wednesday that left Prince Enrique to look for some good bite for his espada ropera, he left without another wait from Olmedo such a great company, that with very beautiful skill to the Port was withdrawn. Fencing spread throughout Western Europe and important sources for rapier fencing arose in Spain, known under the term of destreza ("dexterity"), in the Italian city-states and France. The French small sword or court sword of the 18th century was a direct continuation of this tradition of fencing, but was later used primarily for dueling, though self-defense certainly happened. The smallsword was also used in a limited military context. Rapier fencing forms part of Historical European Martial Arts.
