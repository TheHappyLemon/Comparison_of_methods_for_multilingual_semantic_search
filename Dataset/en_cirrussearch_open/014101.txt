The Vernadsky Research Base (Ukrainian: Антарктична станція Академік Вернадський) is a Ukrainian Antarctic research station at Marina Point on Galindez Island in the Argentine Islands, not far from Kyiv Peninsula. The region is under territorial claims between three countries (see Territorial claims in Antarctica). The single Ukrainian Antarctic station is named after the mineralogist Volodymyr Vernadsky (1863–1945) who was the first president of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. A British research base was established in 1947 and transferred to Ukraine in 1996. Coordination and operational administration of the base is conducted by the National Antarctic Scientific Center of Ukraine which is part of Ministry of Education and Sciences of Ukraine. The closest Antarctic stations are Palmer Station of the United States and Yelcho Base of Chile, reopened in 2015.
