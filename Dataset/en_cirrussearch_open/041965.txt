Athletes from Belarus began their Olympic participation at the 1952 Summer Games in Helsinki, Finland, as part of the Soviet Union (IOC code: URS). After the Soviet Union disbanded in 1991, Belarus, along with four of the other fourteen former Soviet republics, competed in the 1992 Winter Olympics (held in Albertville, France) as the Unified Team. Later in 1992, Belarus joined eleven republics to compete as the Unified Team at the Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. Two years later, Belarus competed for the first time as an independent nation in the 1994 Winter Olympics, held in Lillehammer, Norway. With a total of 105 medals, Belarus is ranked third amongst post-Soviet states, after Russia and Ukraine. Since 1994, Belarus has won medals at each Winter and Summer Olympics it has participated in. In 2022, in response to the Belarus-assisted Russian invasion of Ukraine and its treatment of Belarusian athletes, Belarusian athletes were temporarily suspended by the International Olympic Committee. In January 2023, the International Olympic Committee announced plans to allow Belarusian athletes to participate at the 2024 Summer Olympics as neutrals.
