The Fiji men's national football team (Fijian: timi ni soka ni Viti) is Fiji's national men's team and is controlled by the governing body of football in Fiji, the Fiji Football Association. The team plays most of their home games at the HFC Bank Stadium in Suva. Fiji first participated in the FIFA World Cup qualification in 1982; since 1990, Fiji have attempted to qualify for each World Cup without success. Their best result was a final round appearance in 2010. The national team also represents Fiji at the OFC Nations Cup, having appeared in eight out of ten previous tournaments. Fiji's best result is a third-place finish at the 1998 and 2008 editions. They have won the Melanesia Cup five times and competed in the Pacific Games from 1963 until 2015 when the competition became an under-23 tournament. As in most countries in Oceania where football (or soccer) is not the most popular sport (such as Australia and New Zealand), Fiji's most popular sport is rugby union. As of 2022, Fiji has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. In spite of this, the country's youth football team has enjoyed recent success, qualifying for both the 2015 and 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cups and the 2016 Olympic football tournaments.
