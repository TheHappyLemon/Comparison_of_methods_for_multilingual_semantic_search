According to the theorem, it is possible to expand the polynomial (x + y)n into a sum involving terms of the form axbyc, where the exponents b and c are nonnegative integers with b + c = n, and the coefficient a of each term is a specific positive integer depending on n and b. For example, for n = 4, (x+y)4=x4+4x3y+6x2y2+4xy3+y4.{\displaystyle (x+y)^{4}=x^{4}+4x^{3}y+6x^{2}y^{2}+4xy^{3}+y^{4}.} The coefficient a in the term of axbyc is known as the binomial coefficient (nb){\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{b}}} or (nc){\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{c}}} (the two have the same value). These coefficients for varying n and b can be arranged to form Pascal's triangle. These numbers also occur in combinatorics, where (nb){\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{b}}} gives the number of different combinations (i.e. subsets) of b elements that can be chosen from an n-element set. Therefore (nb){\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{b}}} is usually pronounced as "n choose b".
