Tokaj wine region (Hungarian: Tokaji borvidék Slovak: Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj) or Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region (short Tokaj-Hegyalja or Hegyalja) is a historical wine region located in northeastern Hungary and southeastern Slovakia. It is also one of the seven larger wine regions of Hungary (Hungarian: Tokaji borrégió). Hegyalja means "foothills" in Hungarian, and this was the original name of the region. The region consists of 28 named villages and 11,149 hectares of classified vineyards, of which an estimated 5,500 are currently planted. Tokaj is particularly famous as the origin of Tokaji aszú wine, the world's oldest botrytized wine. Because of its testimony to a long and unique tradition of viticulture and its cultural importance as a wine-making region, Tokaj was declared a World Heritage Site in 2002 under the name Tokaj Wine Region Historic Cultural Landscape. Due to the Treaty of Trianon, a smaller part of the historical wine region now belongs to Slovakia.
