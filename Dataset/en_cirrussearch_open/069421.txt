The Balabac Strait (Filipino: Kipot ng Balabak; Malay: Selat Balabak) is one of the straits that connects the South China Sea with the Sulu Sea. It separates Balabac Island (Palawan province), Philippines, from Balambangan and the Banggi Islands north of Borneo that are a part of Malaysia's Sabah state. The strait is about 50 kilometres (31 mi) wide with a maximum depth of around 100 metres (330 ft). It was therefore likely to have been below sea level before the last ice age, which could have permitted an exchange of flora and fauna between Borneo and the Palawans, such as the tiger.
