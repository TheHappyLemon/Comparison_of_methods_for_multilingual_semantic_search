Shaun the Sheep Movie (marketed as Shaun the Sheep: The Movie) is a 2015 stop-motion animated adventure comedy film written and directed by Richard Starzak and Mark Burton. It is based on the British television series Shaun the Sheep, in turn a spin-off of the Wallace and Gromit film A Close Shave (1995). Starring the voices of Justin Fletcher, John Sparkes, and Omid Djalili, the film follows Shaun and his flock navigating the big city to save their amnesiac farmer, while an overzealous animal control worker pursues the group. It was produced by Aardman Animations, and financed by StudioCanal in association with Anton Capital Entertainment. The film premiered on 24 January 2015 at the Sundance Film Festival, and was theatrically released in the UK on 6 February 2015 and 5 August 2015 in the US. It made $106.2 million at the box office, and became the 9th highest-grossing animated film of 2015. Shaun the Sheep Movie was widely praised by critics, and received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a BAFTA Award, and also garnered five nominations at the Annie Awards, including Best Animated Feature. A stand-alone sequel entitled A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon was released on 18 October 2019.
