In fluid dynamics, dynamic pressure (denoted by q or Q and sometimes called velocity pressure) is the quantity defined by: q=12ρu2{\displaystyle q={\frac {1}{2}}\rho \,u^{2}} where (in SI units): q is the dynamic pressure in pascals (i.e., kg/(m*s2), ρ (Greek letter rho) is the fluid mass density (e.g. in kg/m3), and u is the flow speed in m/s. It can be thought of as the fluid's kinetic energy per unit volume. For incompressible flow, the dynamic pressure of a fluid is the difference between its total pressure and static pressure. From Bernoulli's law, dynamic pressure is given by p0−ps=12ρu2{\displaystyle p_{0}-p_{\text{s}}={\frac {1}{2}}\rho \,u^{2}} where p0 and ps are the total and static pressures, respectively.
