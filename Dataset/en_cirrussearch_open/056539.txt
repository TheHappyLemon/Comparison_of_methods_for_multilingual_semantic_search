The Adršpach-Teplice Rocks (Czech: Adršpašsko-teplické skály, German: Adersbach-Weckelsdorfer Felsenstadt) are a set of sandstone formations in Hradec Králové Region of the Czech Republic. They are named after two nearby municipalities: Adršpach, and Teplice nad Metují. The site was apparently a regional destination during the 19th and early 20th century, as attested by the varied language of stone inscriptions on the site, and surviving postcards. The rocks have been protected as a national nature reserve since 1933, and since 1991 the reserve is within the Broumovsko Protected Landscape Area. The national nature reserve has an area of 17.12 km2 (6.61 sq mi). The area is a popular destination for rock climbers. In recent years, it has become a focus for the high-risk climbing-related sport of rock jumping. The area is also one of the largest permanent breeding sites of peregrine falcon in Europe, as they are protected here under federal law. Some areas have been designated off limits to climbers and hikers to make sure the birds aren't disturbed.
