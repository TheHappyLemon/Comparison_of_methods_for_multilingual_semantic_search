The 2013 NBA All-Star Game was an exhibition basketball game that was played on February 17, 2013, during the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2012–13 season. It was the 62nd edition of the NBA All-Star Game, and was played at Toyota Center in Houston, home of the Houston Rockets. The Western Conference defeated the Eastern Conference, 143–138. Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers was named the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player. The Rockets were awarded the All-Star Game in an announcement by commissioner David Stern on February 8, 2012. This was the third time that Houston had hosted the All-Star Game; the city had previously hosted the event in 1989 at the Astrodome and 2006 at the Toyota Center. Starters for the game were selected by the fans, who could select three frontcourt players and two guards from each conference. Previously, fans selected two forwards and one center instead of generic frontcourt players. Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers received the most overall votes at 1,591,437. Starting this season, NBA All-Star Saturday Night events became contests between the Eastern and Western Conferences.
