Located in the northwestern section of Luzon, it is bordered by the Cordillera Administrative Region to the east, the Cagayan Valley to the northeast and southeast, Central Luzon to the south, and the South China Sea to the west. The region comprises four provinces (Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, and Pangasinan) and one independent city (Dagupan). Its regional center is San Fernando, La Union, whereas the largest settlement is San Carlos, Pangasinan. The 2000 census reported that the major languages spoken in the region were Ilocano (64% of the total population at that time), Pangasinan (32.5%), and Tagalog and other languages (3.21%).
