Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, formerly known as Stadio San Paolo, is a stadium in the western Fuorigrotta suburb of Naples, Italy. It is the fourth largest football stadium in Italy, after Milan's San Siro, Rome's Stadio Olimpico and Bari's San Nicola. For the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, the stadium hosted the football preliminaries. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of S.S.C. Napoli. Constructed in 1959, the stadium was extensively renovated in 1989 for the 1990 World Cup and again in 2018. The stadium currently accommodates 60,240 spectators, but in the past with terraced sections, the stadium took close to 90,000.
