Paradise Harbour, also known as Paradise Bay, is a wide embayment behind Lemaire and Bryde Islands in Antarctica, indenting the west coast of Graham Land between Duthiers and Leniz Points. The name was first applied by whalers operating in the vicinity and was in use by 1920. Argentina's Almirante Brown Antarctic Base stands on the coast of the bay, as does Chile's Gonz√°lez Videla Antarctic Base.
