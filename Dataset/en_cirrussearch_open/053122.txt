A straw mobile is a mobile made from reeds, straw or other similar material bound together with string, often forming geometric shapes such as octahedrons, and can be decorated further with craft supplies such as wood, yarn, or feathers. Such mobiles have been traditional in Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and some countries in Central Europe (such as Poland and Germany) where they may serve as symbolic or religious decorations. Modern variations can be made from materials like brass or plastic. In 2023, Lithuanian straw mobile “sodai” making has been inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
