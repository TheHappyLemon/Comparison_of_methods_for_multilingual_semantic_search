The Milwaukee Brewers are an American professional baseball team based in Milwaukee. The Brewers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central Division. The team's name is derived from the city's association with the brewing industry and has been used by several other baseball teams that have called Milwaukee home. Since 2001, the Brewers have played their home games at American Family Field, which was named Miller Park through the 2020 season and has a seating capacity of 41,900 people. The team was founded as the Seattle Pilots, an expansion team that joined the American League (AL) and began play in Seattle, Washington, in 1969. The Pilots played their home games at Sick's Stadium. After only one season, the team relocated to Milwaukee, becoming known as the Brewers and playing their home games at Milwaukee County Stadium. In 1998, the Brewers joined the National League. They are the only franchise to play in four different divisions since the advent of divisional play in Major League Baseball in 1969. They are also one of two current MLB franchises to switch leagues in the modern era (1900–present); the other franchise is the Houston Astros. The Brewers appeared in the World Series in 1982, and they are one of only five current MLB teams that have never won the World Series. The Brewers are also the oldest MLB team to never win the World Series along with the San Diego Padres and, at 55 seasons, have the second-longest active championship drought in the MLB behind the Cleveland Guardians. After winning the 1982 American League Championship Series (ALCS) against the California Angels, the Brewers faced off against the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series, losing 4–3. In 2011, the Brewers defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks to win the 2011 National League Division Series (NLDS), 3–2, but lost in the National League Championship Series (NLCS) to the eventual World Series champion Cardinals, 4–2. In 2018, the Brewers swept the Colorado Rockies in the NLDS, 3–0, but lost the NLCS to the Los Angeles Dodgers, 4–3. The club has won one AL pennant, six division titles, and has qualified for the postseason as a wild card three times. From 1969 through 2023, the Brewers' overall regular-season win–loss record is 4,215–4,461–4 (.486). Since moving to Milwaukee in 1970, the Brewers have an overall win–loss record of 4,151–4,363–3 (.488) through the end of 2023.
