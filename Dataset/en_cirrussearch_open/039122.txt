Prodrive F1 Team was the name of a proposed Formula One team to be run by Prodrive. The team was selected by the FIA in 2006 to be the 12th entry into the 2008 Formula One world championship. In November 2007, a legal challenge to the team's proposed use of customer cars led to Prodrive pulling out of the 2008 season. In 2009, Prodrive boss David Richards announced that either Prodrive or Aston Martin Racing would appear in F1 from 2010 should the budget caps planned be acceptable. Prodrive Ltd. is based in Banbury, England, but has unveiled plans to relocate to a new 200-acre (81Â ha) motorsport facility called "The Fulcrum" (based at the former RAF Honiley airfield) near Wroxall, Warwickshire.
