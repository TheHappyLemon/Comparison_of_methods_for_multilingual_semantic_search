László Kubala (10 June 1927 – 17 May 2002) was a Hungarian professional footballer. He played as a forward for Ferencváros, Slovan Bratislava, Barcelona and Espanyol, among other clubs. Regarded as one of the best players in history, Kubala is considered a hero of Barcelona. A Hungarian national by birth, he also held Czechoslovak and Spanish citizenship, and played for the national teams of all three countries. Kubala was noted for his quick and skilful dribbling, composed and powerful finishing, and accuracy from free kicks. During the 1950s, he was a leading member of the successful Barcelona team, scoring 280 goals in 345 appearances (including unofficial goals). During the club's 1999 centenary celebrations, a fan's poll declared Kubala the best player ever to play for the Spanish club. After retiring as a player, he had two spells as coach of Barcelona and also coached both Spain's senior national team and Olympic team.
