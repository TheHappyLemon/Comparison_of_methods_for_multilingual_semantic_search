Japanese people (Japanese: 日本人, Hepburn: Nihonjin) are an East Asian ethnic group native to the Japanese archipelago. Japanese people constitute 97.6% of the population of the country of Japan. Worldwide, approximately 126 million people are of Japanese descent, making them one of the largest ethnic groups. Approximately 122.0 million Japanese people are residents of Japan, and there are approximately 4 million members of the Japanese diaspora, known as Nikkeijin (日系人). In some contexts, the term "Japanese people" may be used to refer specifically to the Yamato people (Yamato-minzoku) from mainland Japan; in other contexts the term may include other groups native to the Japanese archipelago, including Ryukyuan people (Ryūkyū-minzoku), who share connections with the Yamato but are often regarded as distinct, and Ainu people (Ainu-minzoku). In recent decades, there has also been an increase in the number of people with both Japanese and non-Japanese roots, including half Japanese people.
