The Golden Globe Awards are accolades bestowed for excellence in both American and international film and television. It is an annual award ceremony held since 1944 to honor artists and professionals and their work. The ceremony is normally held every January, and has been a major part of the film industry's awards season, which culminates each year in the Academy Awards. The eligibility period for the Golden Globes corresponds to the calendar year (from January 1 through December 31). The Golden Globes were founded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), an organization representing international journalists who reported on the American entertainment industry. Revenue from the ceremony was used by the HFPA to fund entertainment-related charities and scholarships, such as the Young Artist Awards. The HFPA had a history of criticism from the movie industry since the 1950s for the small size of its voting membership compared to the Academy Awards and other such accolades, the group's celebrity fawning, and their voting tactics. In 2021, these issues culminated with boycotts of the Golden Globes over the lack of racial diversity in its member body. These resulted in a series of reforms to the HFPA, intended to improve its accountability and widen its voting membership. In June 2022, the HFPA approved a reorganization of the Golden Globes into a for-profit venture owned by Eldridge Industries. This was finalized in June 2023, with the ceremony's assets being acquired by the Eldridge-owned Dick Clark Productions (which has produced the Golden Globes telecast since 1993), and the Golden Globe Foundation being established to continue the HFPA's philanthropic activities.
