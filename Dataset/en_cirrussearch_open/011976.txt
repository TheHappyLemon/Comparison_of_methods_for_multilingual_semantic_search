South Ice was a British support base 560 kilometres (300Â nmi) from the South Pole in Edith Ronne Land, Antarctica during the International Geophysical Year, established by Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, where three men overwintered during the Antarctic winter of 1957. In the same winter, men overwintered for the first time at the South Pole. The name of the station contrasts to North Ice which was a British research station in Greenland.
