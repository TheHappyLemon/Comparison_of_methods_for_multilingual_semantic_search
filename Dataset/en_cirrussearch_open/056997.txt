Vangeliya Pandeva Gushterova (née Surcheva; Bulgarian: Вангелия Пандева Гущерова, née Сурчева, [vɐnˈɡɛlijɐ ˈpɑndevɐ ɡuˈʃtɛrovɐ (ˈsurt͡ʃevɐ)]; 3 October 1911 – 11 August 1996), commonly known as Baba Vanga (Bulgarian: Баба Ванга, lit. 'Grandmother Vanga'), was a Bulgarian attributed mystic and healer who claimed to have foreseen the future. Blind since her early childhood, she spent most of her life in the Rupite area of the Belasica mountains in Bulgaria. In the late 1970s and 1980s, she was widely known in Eastern Europe for her alleged abilities of clairvoyance and precognition. After the fall of communism, and even after her death in 1996, her persona has remained popular.
