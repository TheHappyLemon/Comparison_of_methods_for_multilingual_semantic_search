NordLink is a subsea 1,400 megawatt (MW) HVDC power cable between Norway and Germany, opened in May 2021. The over 500 kilometres (310 mi) long cable operates at a voltage of 500 kV DC. The cable enables Deutsche Bahn to buy the full production from Mågeli kraftverk in Ullensvang, thereby helping the German railways to become climate-neutral by 2040.
