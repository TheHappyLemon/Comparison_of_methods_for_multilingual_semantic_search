Ulukhaktok (Kangiryuarmiutun (Inuit language) spelling Ulukhaqtuuq ([ulukhɑqtuːq̚]) and known until 1 April 2006 as Holman or Holman Island) is a small hamlet on the west coast of Victoria Island, in the Inuvik Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. Like other small traditional communities in the territories, hunting, trapping, and fishing are major sources of income, but printmaking has taken over as the primary source of income in recent years. The two principal languages in Ulukhaktok are the Kangiryuarmiutun dialect of Inuinnaqtun, which is part of the Inuvialuktun group, and English. The village has the world's most northerly golf course. The community was covered in the Inuvialuit Final Agreement as part of their land claims and is in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region.
