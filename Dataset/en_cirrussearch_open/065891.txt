Vyatka Land (Russian: Вятская земля) is a historical region in the basin of the Vyatka River, approximately corresponding to modern-day Kirov Oblast in Russia. While the Permians were its original inhabitants, it was gradually settled by Slavic settlers whose arrival is traditionally dated to the late 12th century. Vyatka Land, being geographically isolated from the rest of the Russian lands, sometimes accepted the suzerainty of other Russian and Tatar states but de facto enjoyed a large degree of independence until it was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1489.
