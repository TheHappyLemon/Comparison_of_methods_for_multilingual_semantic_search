Khachapuri (Georgian: ხაჭაპური khach’ap’uri [χatʃʼapʼuɾi] from ხაჭო khachʼo [χat͡ʃʼo] 'curd' + პური pʼuri [pʼuri] 'bread') is a traditional Georgian dish of cheese-filled bread. The bread is leavened and allowed to rise, molded into various shapes, and then filled in the center with a mixture of cheese (fresh or aged, most commonly, specialized khachapuri cheese), eggs, and other ingredients. It is popular in Georgia, both in restaurants and as street food. As a Georgian staple food, the price of making khachapuri is used as a measure of inflation in different Georgian cities by the "khachapuri index", developed by the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University. It is Georgia's national dish, included in the list of the intangible cultural heritage of Georgia. On the behalf and initiative of the Gastronomic Association of Georgia, the 27th of February was announced as National Khachapuri Day, to celebrate Georgia's signature pastry as well as to promote its recognition internationally. The khachapuri is served hot from the oven, otherwise it loses the taste of its unique cheese mixture and becomes bitter.
