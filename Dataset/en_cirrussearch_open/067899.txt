Nusantara (Indonesian pronunciation: [nusanˈtara]), officially the Capital City of Nusantara (Indonesian: Ibu Kota Nusantara, IKN), is the future capital of Indonesia, scheduled to be inaugurated on 17 August 2024, coinciding with Indonesian Independence Day. Nusantara will replace Jakarta as the national capital, a position the latter city has held since the country's proclamation of independence in 1945. The site is situated on the east coast of the island of Borneo, specifically in the province of East Kalimantan. The city is expected to encompass an area of 2,560 km2 (990 sq mi), surrounded by hilly landscapes, a forest, and a natural bay. Construction began in July 2022, starting with land clearing and the construction of access roads. The initial phase, known as the 'Government Central Area zone', will comprise government offices, schools, and hospitals. The project is estimated to be worth Rp 523 trillion (US$35 billion) and will be finished in 5 phases. Phase 1 started in August 2022. Around 150,000 to 200,000 workers from around Indonesia participated in this project with an additional workforce around the Nusantara region to ensure the participation of local workers. The project is expected to be fully finished in 2045, with Phase 5 being the last. 6,000 civil servants are expected to move into Nusantara by October 2024, in time for the inauguration of President-elect Prabowo Subianto.
