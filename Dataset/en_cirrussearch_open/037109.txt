Crotonic acid ((2E)-but-2-enoic acid) is a short-chain unsaturated carboxylic acid described by the formula CH3CH=CHCO2H. The name crotonic acid was given because it was erroneously thought to be a saponification product of croton oil. It crystallizes as colorless needles from hot water. With a cis-alkene, Isocrotonic acid is an isomer of crotonic acid. Crotonic acid is soluble in water and many organic solvents. Its odor is similar to that of butyric acid.
