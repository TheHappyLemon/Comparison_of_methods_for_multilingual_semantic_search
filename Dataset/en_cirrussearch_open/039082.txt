Estadio Azteca (Latin American Spanish: [esˈtaðjo asˈteka]) is a football stadium located in Mexico City. It is the official home of football team Club América, as well as the Mexico national team. The stadium sits at an altitude of 2,200 m (7,200 feet) above sea level. With a capacity of 87,523, it is the largest stadium in Latin America and the eighth-largest association football stadium in the world. Regarded as one of the most famous and iconic football stadiums in the world, it is the first to have hosted two FIFA World Cup finals; the 1970 World Cup Final, where Brazil defeated Italy 4–1, and the 1986 World Cup Final, where Argentina defeated West Germany 3–2. It also hosted the 1986 quarter-final match between Argentina and England in which Diego Maradona scored both the "Hand of God goal" and the "Goal of the Century". The Estadio Azteca is the only football stadium in the world to have both Pelé (1970) and Diego Maradona (1986) win the FIFA World Cup, both of whom are considered among the greatest football players of all time. The stadium also hosted the "Game of the Century", when Italy defeated West Germany 4–3 in extra time in one of the 1970 semifinal matches. The stadium was also the principal venue for the football tournament of the 1968 Summer Olympics and the 1971 Women's World Cup. The stadium is scheduled to host games during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, including the opening game, making it the only stadium to host three editions of the FIFA World Cup. Additionally, the National Football League (NFL) features one game at Estadio Azteca per season as a part of its International Series.
