Happy Feet Two is a 2011 animated jukebox musical comedy film directed, produced and co-written by George Miller. It is the sequel to the 2006 film Happy Feet starring Elijah Wood, Robin Williams in his final animated feature, Hank Azaria, Alecia Moore (P!nk), Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Sofia Vergara, Common, Hugo Weaving, Richard Carter, Magda Szubanski and Anthony LaPaglia. Wood, Williams, Weaving, Szubanski and LaPaglia reprised their roles with Moore and Common replacing the late Brittany Murphy, and Fat Joe respectively. In addition, E.G. Daily also returned in different roles. In the film, Erik (Ava Acres), the son of Mumble (Wood) and Gloria (Moore) who is reluctant to dance, runs away from home and encounters the Mighty Sven (Azaria), a tufted puffin that can fly. But when the penguins are trapped by a giant wall of ice and snow, they must stop the apocalypse of Antarctica and get a chance to see the true colors. An international co-production between the United States and Australia, Kennedy Miller Mitchell and Dr. D Studios from Sydney, Australia, produced the film, which premiered in North American theaters on November 18, 2011, and in Australia on December 26, 2011 in Digital 3D, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats. The film was released with an attached 3D Looney Tunes short entitled I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat. The film received mixed reviews with critics praising its animation, music and voice acting, while criticizing its narrative. The film underperformed at the box-office grossing just $150.4 million against its $135 million budget (not including marketing costs), which resulted in the closure of Miller's Dr. D Studios, making this their only animated film.
