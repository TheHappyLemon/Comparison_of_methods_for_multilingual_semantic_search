Rúben Filipe Marques Amorim (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈʁubɛn ɐmuˈɾĩ]; born 27 January 1985) is a Portuguese professional football manager and former player who is the current manager of Primeira Liga club Sporting CP. As a footballer, Amorim played mainly as a midfielder, although he could also be deployed as a right-back or winger. He spent most of his professional career with Belenenses and Benfica, signing with the latter in 2008 and going on to win ten major titles, including three league titles, one Taça de Portugal, five Taças da Liga and one Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. He represented Portugal in two FIFA World Cups, earning a total of 14 caps. Upon retiring in 2017, he began his coaching career at Casa Pia in 2018, before resigning in 2018, amid a dispute with the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF). He was appointed as head coach at Braga B, before taking charge of the first team in December 2019, winning the 2020 Taça da Liga. In March 2020, Amorim was appointed manager of Sporting CP for a managerial transfer worth €10 million (£8.65 million), becoming then the third-most expensive manager ever. He guided the club to a double of the Taça da Liga and the Primeira Liga, ending the latter's 19-year league title drought. These achievements won him the Primeira Liga's Manager of the Year award in 2021.
