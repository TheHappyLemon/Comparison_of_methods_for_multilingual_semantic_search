SpaceX Crew-5 was the fifth operational NASA Commercial Crew Program flight of a Crew Dragon spacecraft, and the eighth overall crewed orbital flight. The mission was successfully launched on 5 October 2022 with the aim of transporting four crew members to the International Space Station (ISS). The Crew Dragon spacecraft docked at the ISS on 6 October 2022 at 21:01 UTC. The crew for this mission comprised two NASA astronauts, one JAXA astronaut, and one Russian cosmonaut. Three of the crew members were assigned to this mission due to delays in Boeing's Starliner program. Commander Nicole Mann was reassigned from Boeing's Boe-CFT mission, while Pilot Josh Cassada and Mission Specialist Koichi Wakata transferred from Boeing Starliner-1. Anna Kikina was reassigned from Soyuz MS-22. Among the crew members, three were embarking on their first spaceflight, while Mission Specialist Koichi Wakata was a veteran of four previous space flights.
