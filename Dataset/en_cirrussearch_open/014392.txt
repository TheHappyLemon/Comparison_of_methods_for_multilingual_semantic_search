John Joseph Louis Johnson III (born January 13, 1987) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman who is currently playing for the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has previously played for the Los Angeles Kings, Columbus Blue Jackets, Pittsburgh Penguins, New York Rangers, and Chicago Blackhawks. In his prime, he was a capable two-way defenseman, combining physical prowess and offensive capability. Johnson won the Stanley Cup with the Avalanche in 2022. Following two years with the USA Hockey National Team Development Program, Johnson was selected third overall by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. After a year at the University of Michigan, his rights were traded to the Los Angeles Kings. He played another year at Michigan before signing his first professional contract with the Kings. In February 2012, he was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets after five seasons in Los Angeles. In 2018, he signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins in free agency. But after two disappointing campaigns, he was bought out by the Penguins and he signed a one-year contract with the Rangers. Johnson has represented the United States on the international stage multiple times, most notably playing for Team USA at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.
