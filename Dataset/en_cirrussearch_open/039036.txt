In chess, a skewer is an attack upon two pieces in a line and is similar to a pin. A skewer is the opposite of a pin; the difference is that in a skewer, the more valuable piece is the one under direct attack and the less valuable piece is behind it. The opponent is compelled to move the more valuable piece to avoid its capture, thereby exposing the less valuable piece which can then be captured (see chess piece relative value). Only line pieces (i.e. bishops, rooks, and queens) can skewer; kings, knights, and pawns cannot. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
