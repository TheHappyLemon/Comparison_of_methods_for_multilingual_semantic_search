"Sonne" (German for "sun") is a song by German rock band Rammstein. It was released in February 2001, as the first single from their album Mutter. According to Till Lindemann, the song was originally written as an entrance song for the boxer Vitali Klitschko, whose surname was also the working title of the song. The female vocal comes from Spectrasonic's "Symphony of Voices" sample library. The music video for the band's 2019 single "Deutschland" features a piano-based version of "Sonne" in the ending credits.
