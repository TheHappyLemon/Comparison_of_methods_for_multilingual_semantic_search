The Province of Lapland (Finnish: Lapin lääni, Swedish: Lapplands län) was a province of Finland from 1938 to 2009. It was established in 1938, when it was separated from the Province of Oulu. After the Second World War, the Petsamo municipality (former province) and part of the Salla municipality were ceded to the Soviet Union. It had the same territory as today's region Lapland (Finland).
