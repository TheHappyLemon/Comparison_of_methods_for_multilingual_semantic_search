Munin is a free and open-source computer system monitoring, network monitoring, and infrastructure monitoring software application. Munin is written in Perl and uses RRDtool to create graphs, which are accessible over a web interface. Its emphasis is on plug and play capabilities. About 500 monitoring plugins are currently available. It is intended to make it easy to determine "what's different today" when a performance problem happens and to provide visibility into capacity and utilization of resources.
