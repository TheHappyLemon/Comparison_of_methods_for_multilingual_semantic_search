Panama finished as runners-up at the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 2005, 2013 and 2023, losing to the United States on the former two occasions and to Mexico in the latter. Panama has also competed in the sub-regional Copa Centroamericana which they won in 2009, beating Costa Rica in the final (0–0 on full-time, 5–3 on penalties). They finished in third place on three occasions (1993, 2011, 2014), and finished as runners-up behind Honduras in the 2017 edition, which they hosted. The national team is nicknamed "Los Canaleros" (lit. 'The Canal Men'), in reference to the Panama Canal.
