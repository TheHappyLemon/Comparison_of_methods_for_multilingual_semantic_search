The Museum of the Occupation of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Okupācijas muzejs) is a museum and historic educational institution located in Riga, Latvia. It was established in 1993 to exhibit artifacts, archive documents, and educate the public about the 51-year period in the 20th century when Latvia was successively occupied by the USSR in 1940–1941, then by Nazi Germany in 1941–1944, and then again by the USSR in 1944–1991. Official programs for visits to Latvia of top level representatives of other countries normally include a visit to the Museum of the Occupation. The institution also operates an exhibition in the Corner House - the former KGB headquarters in Riga. After 10 years of reconstruction work, a new permanent exhibition was opened to the public on June 1, 2022. A day before the exhibition was attended by the President of Latvia, Egils Levits, and the Minister of Culture, Nauris Puntulis.
