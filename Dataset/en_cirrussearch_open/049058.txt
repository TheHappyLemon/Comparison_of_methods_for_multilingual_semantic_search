Elena Anatolyevna Lashmanova (Russian: Елена Анатольевна Лашманова, born 9 April 1992 in Saransk, Mordovia) is a Russian race walker. In March 2022, she received a two-year ban, retroactive to March 2021, with all of her results disqualified from February 18, 2012, to January 3, 2014, disqualified for doping use. Lashmanova was the 2012 Olympic Champion in the 20 km walk. In 2021, she received a two-year ban for a doping violation along with a similar penalty for the majority of her training partners shortly thereafter. Her Olympic gold (at time of writing) will be stripped following an IOC decision in March 2022. It is claimed by Russian whistleblower Rodchenkov that her positive sample (found with the doping compound GW1516) was in fact one from her 2012 Olympics mistakenly substituted for a further positive test result by the state run-doping programme. He claims that she had at least 2 positive findings that went unreported and that this one was reported only because it was witnessed by non-Russian experts.
