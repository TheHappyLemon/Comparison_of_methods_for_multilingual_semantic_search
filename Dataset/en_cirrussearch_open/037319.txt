The Accountant is a 2016 American action thriller film directed by Gavin O'Connor, written by Bill Dubuque and starring Ben Affleck, Anna Kendrick, J. K. Simmons, Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, Jeffrey Tambor, and John Lithgow. The storyline follows Christian Wolff, a certified public accountant with autism who makes his living (un-)'cooking the books' (i.e.: sanitizing the already fraudulent financial and accounting records) of criminal and terrorist organizations around the world that are experiencing internal embezzlement. The Accountant premiered in Los Angeles on October 10, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on October 14, 2016. Receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film grossed $155 million worldwide. It received praise for Affleckâ€™s performance and the action sequences featuring pencak silat, an Indonesian martial art, but it was also criticized for its portrayal of autism. A sequel to the film, with most of the cast and creative team returning, is currently in the works at Amazon MGM Studios.
