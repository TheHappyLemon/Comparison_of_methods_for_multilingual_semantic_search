During the existence of the Soviet Union, different governments existed within the Crimean Peninsula. From 1921 to 1936, the government in the Crimea was known as the Crimean Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic and was an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (SFSR); from 1936 to 1945, the name was slightly altered to the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. As a result of alleged collaboration of Crimean Tatars with Nazi Germany during World War II, all Crimean Tatars were deported by the Soviet regime and the peninsula was resettled with other peoples, mainly Russians and Ukrainians. The autonomous republic was thus left without its titular nationality and was downgraded to an oblast within the Russian SFSR on 30 June 1945. It was subsequently transferred to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954. As a result of a state-sanctioned referendum in 1991, it became again an autonomous republic within the Ukrainian SSR, and then within independent Ukraine after 1992.
