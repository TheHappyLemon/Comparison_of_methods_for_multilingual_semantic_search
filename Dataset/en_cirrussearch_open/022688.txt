Peter Prevc (Slovene: [ˈpéːtəɾ ˈpɾéːwts]; born 20 September 1992) is a Slovenian former ski jumper. He won the 2016 Ski Jumping World Cup overall title and four Olympic medals, including gold at the 2022 Winter Olympics in the mixed team event. He also won the 2016 Four Hills Tournament, 2016 Ski Flying World Championships, and three consecutive Ski Flying World Cup overall titles (2014, 2015, and 2016). In addition, Prevc won two team events with the Slovenia national team at the Ski Flying World Championships, in 2022 and 2024. A specialist in ski flying, Prevc is a former world record holder and the first athlete in history to land a jump of 250 metres (820 ft), which remains the Slovenian national distance record. In 2015, in Planica, Prevc became one of the few ski jumpers in history to achieve a "perfect jump", with all five judges awarding him the maximum style points of 20. In the following year, Prevc achieved the most individual World Cup competition wins in a single season – 15 – which is also a record. Prevc was named Slovenian Sportsman of the Year for four consecutive years between 2013 and 2016. In March 2016, he was voted Athlete of the Month by the United States Sports Academy and also ranked third in the Athlete of the Year voting for 2016.
