The House of Hahn (originally Hane and Hanen) was an ancient German-Baltic noble family which was prominent in the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and on the Baltic Island Ösel. It was founded in 1230 and existed until 1914. Von Hahn noble family doesn't exist anymore, no lineage. It was also part of the old Mecklenburg noble family, first mentioned on October 30, 1230. The Mecklenburg clan branched out at the turn of the 14th century into a Mecklenburg and a Courland clan. Later, the family carried the title Baron or Baron (Baroness, Baroness, Freifrau, Freiin), which eas the highest title, which the family ever held. Ludolf Hahn (around 1300) is mentioned as the ancestor of the Baltic lines, whose descendants later established their residence with Heinrich von Hahn (around 1518) in Postenden near Talsen. Johann August von Hahn (around 1725–1799) descended from the Saaremaa von Hahns. Both family lines carried the same coat of arms.
