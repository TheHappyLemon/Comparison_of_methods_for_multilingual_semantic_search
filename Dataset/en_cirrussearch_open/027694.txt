"Himno Istmeño" (English: "Isthmian Hymn") is the national anthem of Panama (Spanish: Himno Nacional de Panamá). The music was composed by Santos A. Jorge, and the lyrics were written by Jeronimo de la Ossa. It is also known by its incipit, "Alcanzamos por fin la victoria" ("At last we reached victory"). The song is directed to the average, working-class Panamanian, with such lyrics as "Ahead the shovel and pick; At work without any more dilation".
