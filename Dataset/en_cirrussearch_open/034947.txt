Tricholoma equestre or Tricholoma flavovirens, commonly known as the man on horseback or yellow knight is a widely eaten but arguably toxic fungus of the genus Tricholoma that forms ectomycorrhiza with pine trees. Known as Grünling in German, gąska zielonka in Polish, míscaro in Portuguese and canari in French, it has been treasured as an edible mushroom worldwide and is especially abundant in France and Central Portugal. Although it is regarded as quite tasty, cases of poisoning from eating T. equestre have been reported. Research has revealed it to have poisonous properties, but these claims are disputed.
