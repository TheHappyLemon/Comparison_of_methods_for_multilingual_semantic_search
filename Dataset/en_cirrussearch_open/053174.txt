The voiced labiodental plosive or stop is a consonant sound produced like a [b], but with the lower lip contacting the upper teeth, as in [v]. This can be represented in the IPA as ⟨b̪⟩. A separate symbol that is sometimes seen, especially in Bantu linguistics, but not recognized by the IPA, is the db ligature ⟨ȸ⟩. The voiced labiodental plosive is not known to be phonemic in any language. However, it does occur allophonically: In the Austronesian language Sika, this sound occurs as an allophone of the labiodental flap in careful pronunciation.[citation needed] The XiNkuna dialect of Tsonga has affricates, [p̪͡f] (voiceless labiodental affricate) and [b̪͡v] (voiced labiodental affricate).
