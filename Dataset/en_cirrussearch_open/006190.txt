Agnieszka Roma Radwańska (Polish: [aɡˈɲɛʂka raˈdvaj̃ska] ; born 6 March 1989) is a Polish former professional tennis player. She won 20 career singles WTA Tour titles, two doubles titles, and achieved a career-high singles ranking of world No. 2 on 9 July 2012. Her achievements include winning the season-ending 2015 WTA Finals, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Fan Favourite Award six times, Shot of the Year five times, and Shot of the Month on a regular basis. Radwańska holds a number of tennis accolades. She is the first Polish player in the Open Era to reach a major singles final (at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships), the first to win the WTA Finals (in 2015), the first to claim a WTA Tour singles title (the 2007 Nordic Light Open), and was part of the first Polish team to win the Hopman Cup in 2015. In addition, she won the WTA award for Most Impressive Newcomer in 2006, and finished with a top 10 year-end ranking eight times (including six consecutive times from 2011 to 2016). Radwańska is widely considered one of the best tennis players to have never won a major; her accomplishments among Polish players have only recently been surpassed by those of Iga Świątek. Radwańska was voted the WTA's Fan Favorite Singles Player for six consecutive years (2011–2016), the most of any player, in polls held by WTATennis.com. Radwańska also won WTA's Fan Favorite Shot of the Year for five consecutive years (2013–2017). For her accomplishments in sport and for representing her country with distinction, in 2013 she was awarded the Gold Cross of Merit by Polish President Bronisław Komorowski. On 14 November 2018, Radwańska announced her retirement from professional tennis at the age of 29.
