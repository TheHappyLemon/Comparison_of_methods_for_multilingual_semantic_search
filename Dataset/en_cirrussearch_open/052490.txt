A veteran (from Latin vetusÂ 'old') is a person who has significant experience (and is usually adept and esteemed) and expertise in an occupation or field. A military veteran is a person who is no longer serving in the armed forces. A topic of interest for researchers has been the health of military personnel after leaving the military, particularly those who served in combat areas. This concern stems from veterans in countries like the US and Australia, being disproportionately over-represented in psychological and substance abuse disorders relative to the general population. In Australia, the Department of Veterans' Affairs provides a proactive service to address 'real life' health care problems in the veteran community.
