"$456,000 Squid Game in Real Life!" is a YouTube video by American YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, known on the platform as MrBeast. The video, released on November 24, 2021, is a competition based on the games featured in the 2021 South Korean Netflix show Squid Game. Donaldson began work on the video in October 2021. Partially funded by Finnish video game developer Supercell to promote its mobile game Brawl Stars, the video cost US$3.5 million to produce, of which $2 million was spent on sets and production and $1.5 million was given as cash prizes to the contestants. Donaldson recreated several of the show's sets for the video. As in the show, the 456 players competed in a series of games until only one player remained. After the video was published on November 24, 2021, it quickly received over 100 million views and became MrBeast's most-viewed video (not including Shorts). As of February 2024[update], it has received over 570 million views. Publications praised Donaldson for his accurate recreations of the sets, but some critics saw the video as unoriginal and a misunderstanding of Squid Game's anti-capitalist themes.
