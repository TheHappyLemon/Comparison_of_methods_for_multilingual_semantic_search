Limonka - newspaper of direct action (Russian: Лимонка - газета прямого действия) is a Moscow-based newspaper. Limonka was the official organ of the National Bolshevik Party until it was banned in 2007; since 2010 it has been the official organ of The Other Russia. The name is a play of words on the party's founder surname Limonov and idiomatic Russian for grenade. The organization was banned in 2002.
