A solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device. It provides persistent data storage using no moving parts. It is sometimes called semiconductor storage device, solid-state device and, despite not having a disk-shaped part such as in a hard disk drive (HDD) or a floppy disk, solid-state disk. An SSD is often used as secondary storage to provide relatively fast, persistent, direct-attached storage in a computer.
