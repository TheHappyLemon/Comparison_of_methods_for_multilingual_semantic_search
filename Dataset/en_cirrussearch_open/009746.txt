Nonmetals are chemical elements that mostly lack distinctive metallic properties. They range from colorless gases like hydrogen to shiny crystals like iodine. Physically, they are usually lighter (less dense) than metals; brittle or crumbly if solid; and often poor conductors of heat and electricity. Chemically, nonmetals have high electronegativity (meaning they usually attract electrons in a chemical bond); and their oxides tend to be acidic. Seventeen elements are widely recognized as nonmetals. Additionally, some or all of six borderline elements (metalloids) are sometimes counted as nonmetals. The two lightest nonmetals, hydrogen and helium, together make up about 98% of the mass of the observable universe. Five nonmetallic elements—hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and silicon—make up the bulk of Earth's oceans, atmosphere, biosphere, and crust. The diverse properties of nonmetals enable a range of natural and technological uses. Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen are essential building blocks for life. In technology, nonmetals are used in, for example, electronics, energy storage, agriculture, and chemical production. Most nonmetallic elements were not identified until the 18th and 19th centuries. While a distinction between metals and other minerals had existed since antiquity, a basic classification of chemical elements as metallic or nonmetallic emerged only in the late 18th century. Since then over twenty properties have been suggested as criteria for distinguishing nonmetals from metals.
