Scott Pilgrim is a series of graphic novels by Canadian author and comic book artist Bryan Lee O'Malley. The original edition of the series consists of six digest size black-and-white volumes, released between August 2004 and July 2010, by Portland-based independent comic book publisher Oni Press. It was later republished by Fourth Estate, an imprint of HarperCollins. Full-colour hardback volumes, coloured by Nathan Fairbairn, were released from August 2012 to April 2014. The series revolves around the titular Scott Pilgrim, a slacker and part-time musician who lives in Toronto and plays bass ‚Äçin a band, dating a high school student while recovering from a traumatic breakup. He starts a tentative romance with American delivery girl Ramona Flowers, soon discovering that Ramona possesses superpowers. It transpires that her seven supervillain exes have similar abilities. They are manipulated into targeting Scott in combat by her most recent ex, Gideon Graves, forcing both Scott and Ramona to come to terms with their respective pasts, relationships, and behaviors. The Scott Pilgrim series received widespread acclaim and garnered a large cult following. A film adaptation of the series titled Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, directed by Edgar Wright, was released in August 2010. A video game adaptation, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game, developed by Ubisoft for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was released the same month. An animated series adaptation titled Scott Pilgrim Takes Off released on Netflix in November 2023, with the cast of the 2010 film reprising their roles, O'Malley writing the script, and Wright serving as an executive producer. Because each adaptation in the franchise covers the same story as the graphic novels, but with slight changes between each of them, Scott Pilgrim has been widely discussed as an example of transmedia storytelling.
