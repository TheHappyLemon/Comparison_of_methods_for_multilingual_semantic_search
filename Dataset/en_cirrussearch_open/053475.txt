The Stade Josy Barthel is the former national stadium of Luxembourg, and the former home of the Luxembourg national football team. The stadium, which also hosted rugby union and athletics events, is located on route d'Arlon, in the Luxembourg City quarter of Belair. Following the opening of the Stade de Luxembourg in September 2021, the stadium and its grounds are currently due for demolition and redevelopment, to be ultimately replaced with a new mixed use neighbourhood named "Wunnquartier Stade".
