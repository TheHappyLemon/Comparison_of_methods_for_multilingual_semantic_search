Hidradenitis is any disease in which the histologic abnormality is primarily an inflammatory infiltrate around the eccrine glands.: 780  This group includes neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis and recurrent palmoplantar hidradenitis.: 780  It can also be defined more generally as an inflammation of sweat glands. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic cutaneous condition originally thought to be primarily characterized by suppurative inflammation of the apocrine sweat glands.: 710  Recent evidence supports that the primary event is follicular hyperkeratosis and obstruction, but the term hidradenitis supperativa has continued to be used in major medical journals.
