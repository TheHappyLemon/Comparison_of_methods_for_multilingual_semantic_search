Primorsky Krai (Russian: Приморский край, lit. 'coastal territory'), informally known as Primorye (Приморье, [prʲɪˈmorʲjɪ]), is a federal subject (a krai) of Russia, located in the Far East region of the country and is a part of the Far Eastern Federal District. The city of Vladivostok on the southern coast of the krai is its administrative center, and is one of the two largest cities in the Russian Far East together with Khabarovsk. The krai has the largest economy among the federal subjects in the Russian Far East, and a population of 1,845,165 as of the 2021 Census. The krai shares Russia's only border with North Korea, along the Tumen River in Khasansky District in the southwestern corner of the krai. Peter the Great Gulf, the largest gulf in the Sea of Japan, is located along the south coast. Historically part of Manchuria, Primorsky Krai was ceded to the Russian Empire by Qing China in 1860 as part of a region known as Russian Manchuria, forming most of the territory of Primorskaya Oblast. During the Russian Civil War it became part of the Far Eastern Republic before joining the Soviet Union, going through numerous changes until reaching its current form in 1938. Primorsky Krai is home to the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet and is also known as the birthplace of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
