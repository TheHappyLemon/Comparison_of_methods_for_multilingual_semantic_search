In matrix theory, the rule of Sarrus is a mnemonic device for computing the determinant of a 3×3{\displaystyle 3\times 3} matrix named after the French mathematician Pierre Frédéric Sarrus. Consider a 3×3{\displaystyle 3\times 3} matrix M=[abcdefghi]{\displaystyle M={\begin{bmatrix}a&b&c\\d&e&f\\g&h&i\end{bmatrix}}} then its determinant can be computed by the following scheme. Write out the first two columns of the matrix to the right of the third column, giving five columns in a row. Then add the products of the diagonals going from top to bottom (solid) and subtract the products of the diagonals going from bottom to top (dashed). This yields det(M)=|abcdefghi|=aei+bfg+cdh−ceg−bdi−afh.{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\det(M)={\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\d&e&f\\g&h&i\end{vmatrix}}=aei+bfg+cdh-ceg-bdi-afh.\end{aligned}}} A similar scheme based on diagonals works for 2×2{\displaystyle 2\times 2} matrices: |abcd|=ad−bc{\displaystyle {\begin{vmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{vmatrix}}=ad-bc} Both are special cases of the Leibniz formula, which however does not yield similar memorization schemes for larger matrices. Sarrus' rule can also be derived using the Laplace expansion of a 3×3{\displaystyle 3\times 3} matrix. Another way of thinking of Sarrus' rule is to imagine that the matrix is wrapped around a cylinder, such that the right and left edges are joined.
