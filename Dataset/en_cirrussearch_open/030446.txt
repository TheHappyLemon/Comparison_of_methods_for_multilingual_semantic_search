Karl Robatsch (October 14, 1929 in Klagenfurt – September 19, 2000) was a leading Austrian chess player and a noted botanist. He moved to Graz at the age of 17 to become a student and often frequented the Mountainside Café, a popular meeting place for chess players. As he already had a recognisable chess talent, he joined a local club 'SK Gemeinde' (Municipal chess club) and quickly advanced to master standard.
