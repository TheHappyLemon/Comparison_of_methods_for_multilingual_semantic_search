La Cérémonie (English: lit. The Ceremony) is a 1995 French-German psychological thriller film by Claude Chabrol, adapted from the 1977 novel A Judgement in Stone by Ruth Rendell. The film echoes the case of Christine and Lea Papin, two French maids who brutally murdered their employer's wife and daughter in 1933, as well as the 1947 play they inspired, The Maids by Jean Genet. The film received widespread critical acclaim with detached praise towards Chabrol's screenplay and directing, and Bonnaire and Huppert's performances.
