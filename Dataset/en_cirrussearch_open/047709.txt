The Croatian Wikipedia (Croatian: Wikipedija na hrvatskome jeziku) is the Croatian language version of Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, started on February 16, 2003. This version has 219,994 articles and a total of 6.88 million edits have been made. It has 310,624 registered users, out of which 491 have been active in the last 30 days, and 13 administrators. Throughout 2014, fewer than two dozen editors made more than 100 edits a month; around 150 made more than 5 edits a month. Around 750 articles are ranked as featured (Croatian: Izabrani članci). In the period from 2013 to 2021, the Croatian Wikipedia received attention from international media for promoting a far-right worldview, including anti-LGBT propaganda and bias against Serbs of Croatia by the means of historical denialism and by negating or diluting the severity of crimes committed by the Ustaše regime. Apart from whitewashing the crimes and vices of World War II–era criminals, the same has been done for contemporary Croatian politicians and public figures; such falsified and biased content on Croatian Wikipedia has been supported through massive usage of unreliable sources, all of which received negative reception from the Croatian government, media, and historians. Several editors involved in co-opting Croatian Wikipedia throughout the 2010s were banned or demoted in 2021, when it was found that one of the most active administrators took control of the site by having about eighty sockpuppet accounts.
