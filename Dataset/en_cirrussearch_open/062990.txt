The Hutsuls (Ukrainian: Гуцули, romanized: Hutsuly; Polish: Huculi, Hucułowie; Romanian: huțuli) are an East Slavic ethnic group spanning parts of western Ukraine and Romania (i.e. parts of Bukovina and Maramureș). They have often been officially and administratively designated a subgroup of Ukrainians, and are largely regarded as constituting a broader Ukrainian ethnic group.
