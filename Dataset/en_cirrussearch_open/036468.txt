Psyllic acid (also psyllostearic acid, tritriacontanoic acid or ceromelissic acid) is a saturated fatty acid. The rare fatty acid occurs in insect waxes, in the wax of wax scale insects, in the propolis of bees and bumblebees and in a few plants. Its name is derived from the alder leaf flea (Psylla alni).
