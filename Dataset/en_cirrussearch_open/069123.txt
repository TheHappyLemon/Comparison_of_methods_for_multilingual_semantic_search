Canigao Channel is a strait in the Central Visayan and Eastern Visayan regions in the Philippines. This strait separates the islands of Bohol and Leyte, while the Cebu Strait separates Bohol and Cebu. Thus, the Camotes Sea is connected to the Bohol Sea both by the Canigao Channel (east of Bohol) and Cebu Strait (west of Bohol). The Adam Reef, the Abel Reef, the Cain Reef, and the Eve Reef are coral reefs that can be found in this channel. The Tood Islets and Canigao Island can also be found in this channel.
