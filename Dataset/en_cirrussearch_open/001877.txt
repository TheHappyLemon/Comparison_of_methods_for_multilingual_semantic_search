Biruta Baumane (6 June 1922 – 21 January 2017) was a Latvian figurative painter, one of the most notable of her generation of 20th century artists who developed the "harsh style" as a variety of Socialist realism that dominated in the late 1950s and 1960s in Latvian art. She is best known for her figural scenes, still lifes, portraits and women nudes. She was an honorary member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences and Artists’ Union of Latvia.
