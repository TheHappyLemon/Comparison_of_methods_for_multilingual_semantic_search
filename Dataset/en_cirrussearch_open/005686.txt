59°44′N 30°5′E﻿ / ﻿59.733°N 30.083°E﻿ / 59.733; 30.083 Krasnoye Selo (Russian: Кра́сное Село́, lit. Red (or beautiful) village) is a municipal town in Krasnoselsky District of the federal city of St. Petersburg, Russia. It is located south-southeast of the city center. Population: 44,323 (2010 Census); 44,081 (2002 Census). It was founded in the early 18th century as simply Krasnoye, as a suburban village south of St. Petersburg. In 1764, the village had a paper mill, located near the road leading to St. Petersburg. During the 19th century, Krasnoye Selo developed as a recreational suburb of the capital with numerous summer dachas and villas, including the summer residences of the royals. In 1884, the famous airplane designer Alexander Mozhaysky tested his early monoplane there, achieving a power-assisted take off or 'hop' of 60 to 100 feet (18 to 30 m). In late pre-revolutionary times, Krasnoye Selo was the location of the annual military manoeuvres presided over by the ruling Emperor himself. It was in Krasnoye Selo that, on Saturday July 25, 1914, the council of ministers was held at which Tsar Nicholas II decided to protect Serbia in its conflict with Austria, thereby bringing about Russia's entrance in the First World War. During World War II, Krasnoye Selo was under German occupation from 12 September 1941 until 19 January 1944. Krasnoye Selo was granted town status in 1925, and in 1973 it was transferred under the jurisdiction of the city of Leningrad (St. Petersburg's name in 1924–91).
