Mestis (from Finnish: Mestaruussarja, meaning 'Championship series', stylized as MEST1S) is the second-highest men's ice hockey league in Finland. The league was established by the Finnish Ice Hockey Association in 2000 to replace the I-divisioona ('First Division'). Mestis is the highest league that can be reached through playing merits alone. Being promoted to SM-liiga is only possible if a team's Liiga license application is accepted. Mestis, however, is an open league where relegation and promotion are possible with the 3rd league, Suomi-sarja. Mestis is also the highest league governed by the FIHA.
