Jorge de Amorim Campos (born 17 August 1964), better known as Jorginho, is a Brazilian professional football manager and former player who is the head coach of Thai League 1 club Buriram United. A quick, technically gifted, and hard-working right back, Jorginho is regarded as one of the best full-backs of his generation, and as one of the greatest Brazilian defenders of all time. He played in his native country for five different clubs, and also spent six years in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich and three in Japan with Kashima Antlers; at international level, he was part of the Brazilian team that won the 1994 World Cup. After retiring in 2002, Jorginho took up coaching for a short period before working as the assistant to head coach Dunga with the Brazil national team for four years. He later returned to coaching duties, being in charge of several clubs in his home country as well as his former side Kashima Antlers in Japan and Al Wasl in the UAE.
