The province of Enna (Italian: provincia di Enna; Sicilian: pruvincia di Enna; officially libero consorzio comunale di Enna) is a province in the autonomous island region of Sicily, Italy. It was created in 1927, out of parts of the provinces of Caltanisetta and Catania. The capital was designated as Enna (then called Castrogiovanni), instead of Piazza Armerina, due to the influence of politician Napoleone Colajanni. Following the suppression of the Sicilian provinces, it was replaced in 2015 by the free municipal consortium of Enna (Italian: libero consorzio comunale di Enna). Its capital is the city of Enna, located on a mountain and the highest provincial capital in Sicily. Located in the center of the island, it is the only landlocked province in Sicily. The province of Enna has an area of 2,562 square kilometres (989 sq mi), and a total population of 168,052 (2017). There are 20 comuni (sg.: comune) in the province [1], see comuni of the province of Enna. The main comunes by population are:
