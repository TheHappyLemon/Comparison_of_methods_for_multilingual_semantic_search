Douglas (Manx: Doolish, pronounced [ˈdðuːlʲəʃ]) is the capital city and largest settlement of the Isle of Man, with a population of 26,677 (2021) and an area of 10.5  km2 (4.05  mi2). It is located at the mouth of the River Douglas, and on a sweeping bay of two miles (three kilometres). The River Douglas forms part of the city's harbour and main commercial port. Douglas was a small settlement until it grew rapidly as a result of links with the English port of Liverpool in the 18th century. Further population growth came in the following century, resulting during the 1860s in a staged transfer of the High Courts, the Lieutenant Governor's residence (actually located in nearby Onchan), and finally the seat of the legislature, Tynwald, to Douglas from the ancient capital, Castletown. The city is the island's main hub for business, finance, legal services, shipping, transport, shopping, and entertainment. The annual Isle of Man TT motorcycle races start and finish in Douglas.
