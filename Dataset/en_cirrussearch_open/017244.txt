The Foyn Coast (66°40′S 64°20′W﻿ / ﻿66.667°S 64.333°W﻿ / -66.667; -64.333) is that portion of the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula between Cape Alexander and Cape Northrop. It was discovered in 1893 by a Norwegian expedition under Captain Carl Anton Larsen, who named it for Svend Foyn, a Norwegian whaler of Tønsberg whose invention of the grenade harpoon greatly facilitated modern whaling.
