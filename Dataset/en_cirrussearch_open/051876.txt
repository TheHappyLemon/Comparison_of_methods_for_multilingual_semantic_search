Vilkitsky Island, (Russian: Остров Вильки́цкого; Ostrov Vil'kitskogo) is an island in the Kara Sea. It is located 40 km northeast of Shokalsky Island, off the tip of the Gyda Peninsula in North Siberia. This island is not to be confused with other islands called "Vilkitsky", such as the small Vilkitsky group (now mentioned as Dzhekman Islands in most maps) which is part of the Nordenskiöld Archipelago, the Vilkitsky Islands located in the Laptev Sea off the eastern shores of the Taymyr Peninsula, and also Vilkitsky Island in the De Long Group in the East Siberian Sea.
