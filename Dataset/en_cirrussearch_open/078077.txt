"Seemann" ("Seaman"/"Sailor") is a song by German band Rammstein, released as the second single from their album Herzeleid. It was composed by bass player Oliver Riedel, with lyrics by Till Lindemann. The video shows Christoph Schneider, Oliver Riedel, Paul Landers and Richard Kruspe pulling a boat through the sand, with Till Lindemann and Flake, who's wearing a plague doctor mask, inside. Later, they decide to keelhaul Lindemann, still singing. The boat winds up in flames. The video is intertwined with shots of a woman, alternately dressed in a white robe and black clothing.
