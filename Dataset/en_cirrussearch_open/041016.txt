Time and Again is a 1970 illustrated novel by American writer Jack Finney. The many illustrations in the book are real, though, as explained in an endnote, not all are from 1882, the year in which the main action of the book takes place. A sequel, From Time to Time (1995), was published during the final year of the author's life. The book left room for a third novel, apparently never written. In the afterword of 11/22/63, Stephen King states that Time and Again is "in this writerâ€™s humble opinion, the great time-travel story." He had originally intended to dedicate his book to Jack Finney.
