Brendan Lemieux (born March 15, 1996) is an American-born Canadian professional ice hockey left winger for the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Buffalo Sabres selected Lemieux in the second round, 31st overall, of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. He previously played for the Winnipeg Jets, New York Rangers, Los Angeles Kings and Philadelphia Flyers. The son of former NHL player Claude Lemieux, Lemieux began playing hockey at a young age despite his father's wishes, and spent his minor ice hockey career in the Greater Toronto Hockey League and The Hill Academy. He agreed to spend two years with the Green Bay Gamblers of the United States Hockey League before attending the University of North Dakota, but abandoned both commitments after being drafted by the Barrie Colts of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in 2012. Lemieux's strong performance during his second year of junior ice hockey made him an attractive prospect going into the 2014 NHL draft, and his family was disappointed that he was not taken in the first round. While still playing with Barrie, Lemieux was traded to Winnipeg, with which he signed a contract in July 2015. He finished his junior hockey career with the Windsor Spitfires after a midseason trade during the 2015–16 OHL season. Lemieux began his professional hockey career with the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League during the 2016–17 AHL season. He was selected to Winnipeg's NHL roster for the 2018–19 season, but received only limited ice time, and was traded to the Rangers that February for Kevin Hayes. His development during the 2019–20 NHL season was impeded by a fractured hand and the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 2020–21 season, Lemieux was traded to the Kings, where he followed his father into becoming a pest and agitator on the lower offensive lines.
