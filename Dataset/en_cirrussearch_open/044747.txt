Disaster Movie is a 2008 American parody film written and directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer and produced by Peter Safran, Friedberg, and Seltzer. It stars Matt Lanter, Vanessa Minnillo, Gary "G Thang" Johnson, Crista Flanagan, Nicole Parker, Ike Barinholtz, Carmen Electra, Tony Cox, and Kim Kardashian in her feature film debut. It was released on August 29, 2008, by Lionsgate. The film is mainly a parody of the disaster film genre, although it also references many other films, TV shows, people, and pop culture events of the time. The film was panned by critics and audiences for its forced adult humor, excessive pop culture references, and poor writing, acting and directing, with many considering it to be the worst movie directed by Seltzer and Friedberg, as well as one of the worst films of all time. The movie received six nominations for the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $34.8 million against a budget of $20 million.
