TV5 (also known as 5 and formerly known as ABC) is a Philippine free-to-air television and radio network. It is headquartered in Mandaluyong, with alternate studios located in Novaliches, Quezon City. TV5 serves as the flagship property of TV5 Network, Inc., which is owned by MediaQuest Holdings, the multimedia arm of telecommunications conglomerate PLDT. The network is commonly referred to as "The Kapatid Network", using the Filipino term for "sibling", a branding introduced in 2010. TV5 derives its name from its flagship station in Metro Manila, DWET-TV, which broadcasts on VHF Channel 5 for analog transmission, UHF Channel 18 for digital transmission, and UHF Channel 51 for digital test transmission (licensed to TV5's sister company, Mediascape/Cignal TV). In addition to DWET-TV, TV5 operates seven other owned-and-operated stations and has nine affiliate television stations. Its programming is available on cable and satellite TV providers nationwide. TV5's content is also accessible outside the Philippines through Kapatid Channel and AksyonTV International.
