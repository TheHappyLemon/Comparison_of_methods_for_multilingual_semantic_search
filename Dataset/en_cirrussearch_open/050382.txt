The Union of Brest took place in 1595-1596 and represented an agreement by Eastern Orthodox Churches in the Ruthenian portions of the Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth to accept the Pope's authority while maintaining Eastern Orthodox liturgical practices, leading to the formation of the Ruthenian Uniate Church, which currently exists as the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church.
