An antianginal is a drug used in the treatment of angina pectoris, a symptom of ischaemic heart disease. Myocardial ischemia arises from the dysfunction of coronary macrovascular or microvascular components, leading to a compromised supply of oxygen and nutrients to the myocardium. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms encompass a range of factors, including atherosclerosis in epicardial coronary arteries, vasospasm in large or small vessels, and microvascular dysfunctionâ€”whose clinical significance is increasingly acknowledged. The diverse clinical presentations of myocardial ischemia collectively fall under the term chronic coronary syndromes. Addressing these conditions involves a multifaceted approach, where the most common antianginal medications alleviate symptoms by inducing coronary vasodilation and modifying the determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption, such as heart rate, myocardial wall stress, and ventricular contractility. Additionally, these medications can alter cardiac substrate metabolism to alleviate ischemia by enhancing the efficiency of myocardial oxygen utilization. While there is consensus on the prognostic importance of lifestyle interventions and preventive measures like aspirin and statin therapy, determining the optimal antianginal treatment for chronic coronary syndrome patients remains less defined. The majority of individuals experiencing stable angina can effectively address their condition through lifestyle modifications, particularly by embracing smoking cessation and incorporating regular exercise into their routine. Alongside these lifestyle changes, the use of antianginal drugs is a common approach. However, findings from randomized controlled trials reveal that the efficacy of various antianginal drugs is comparable, with none demonstrating a significant reduction in mortality or the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Despite this, prevailing guidelines lean towards recommending beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers as the preferred first-line treatment. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for managing stable coronary artery disease provide well-defined classes of recommendation with corresponding levels of evidence. In a parallel vein, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for stable angina management consider cost-effectiveness in their recommendations, designating terms such as first-line and second-line therapy. Notably, both sets of guidelines advocate for the use of low-dose aspirin and statins as disease-modifying agents. This article aims to critically examine and evaluate the pharmacological recommendations outlined in these guidelines for the management of patients with stable angina. By delving into the nuances of these recommendations, we seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of the rationale behind the suggested pharmacological interventions for stable angina, shedding light on their respective strengths and considerations in clinical practice.
