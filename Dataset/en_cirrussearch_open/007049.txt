The afghani (sign: ؋ or Af (plural: Afs) code: AFN; Pashto: افغانۍ; Dari: افغانی) is the official currency of Afghanistan since the 1920s. It is nominally subdivided into 100 puls (پول), although there are no pul coins in circulation these days.[when?] Printed in Poland, the afghani currency is managed solely by the nation's central bank, Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB). The afghani was introduced in 1923 but is still informally referred to as a rupee by some in conversing and transactions, a legacy of its predecessing Afghan rupee currency. Its exchange rate is around 70 afghanis for 1 United States dollar (as of November 2023).
