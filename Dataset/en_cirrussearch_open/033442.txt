The 107th edition of the Milan–San Remo cycling classic took place on Saturday, 19 March 2016. It was the fourth of 28 races of the 2016 UCI World Tour; the first one-day race. It was also the first cycling monument of the season. It was won by Arnaud Démare in a sprint finish, ahead of Ben Swift (Team Sky) and Jürgen Roelandts (Lotto–Soudal). The finish was disrupted by a crash involving Fernando Gaviria (Etixx–Quick-Step), causing several riders to take avoiding action, ruling them out of contention. A landslide on the road caused the race to be diverted for a length of 9 km (5.6 mi).
