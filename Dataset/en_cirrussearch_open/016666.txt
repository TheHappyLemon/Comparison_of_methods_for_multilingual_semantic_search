The World Mission Society Church of God is a new religious movement originated in South Korea in 1964. After Ahn Sahng-hong died in 1985, Kim Joo-cheol and Zahng Gil-jah changed the church's name to Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong Church of God. Thereafter, the Church expanded its activities to other parts of the world and began using the name World Mission Society Church of God. Its headquarters as well as its main church are located in the southeast of the Seoul metropolitan area (see end of infobox). The church believes in Christ Ahn Sahng-hong, as well as God the Mother, Zahng Gil-jah, as God. The church also believes it is restoring the truth of the early church.
