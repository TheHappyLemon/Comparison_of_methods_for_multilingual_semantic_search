Khanty-Mansi Town; Khanty: Ёмвоҷ, Jomvoćś; Mansi: Абга, Abga) is a city and the administrative centre of Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug–Yugra, Russia. It stands on the eastern bank of the Irtysh River, 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) from its confluence with the Ob, in the oil-rich region of Western Siberia. Though an independent city, Khanty-Mansiysk also functions as the administrative centre of Khanty-Mansiysky District. Khanty-Mansiysk is one of few capitals of Russian regions that is not the largest city in the area, surpassed by Surgut, Nizhnevartovsk and Nefteyugansk.
