The astronomical unit (symbol: au, or AU) is a unit of length defined to be exactly equal to 149,597,870,700Â m. Historically, the astronomical unit was originally conceived as the average Earth-Sun distance (the average of Earth's aphelion and perihelion), before its modern redefinition in 2012. The astronomical unit is used primarily for measuring distances within the Solar System or around other stars. It is also a fundamental component in the definition of another unit of astronomical length, the parsec. One au is equivalent to 499 light-seconds to within 10 parts per million.
