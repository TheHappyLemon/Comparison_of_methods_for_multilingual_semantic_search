Dimethyl ether (DME; also known as methoxymethane) is the organic compound with the formula CH3OCH3, (sometimes ambiguously simplified to C2H6O as it is an isomer of ethanol). The simplest ether, it is a colorless gas that is a useful precursor to other organic compounds and an aerosol propellant that is currently being demonstrated for use in a variety of fuel applications. Dimethyl ether was first synthesised by Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugene PÃ©ligot in 1835 by distillation of methanol and sulfuric acid.
