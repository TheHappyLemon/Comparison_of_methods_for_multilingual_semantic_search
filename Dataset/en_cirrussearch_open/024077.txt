Jørgen Alfred Hviid (Latvian: Jergens Alfreds Hvīds; 1 September 1916 – 5 September 2001) was a Danish and Latvian multi-sport athlete, and an officer in the Royal Danish Navy. He was primarily an ice hockey player, but also competed in speed skating and sailing. Hviid grew up in Riga, and played on the Latvia men's national ice hockey team as a teenager. He later moved to Denmark, and joined the Danish resistance movement at the onset of World War II, and began a military career. He founded the Kjøbenhavns SF hockey team in 1938, and served as the first captain of the Denmark men's national ice hockey team at the 1949 World Ice Hockey Championships. He won Danish ice hockey league championships as a player and as a coach, and was later a board member on the Danish Ice Hockey Union. He was posthumously inducted into both the IIHF Hall of Fame, and the Danish Ice Hockey Hall of Fame, and is referred to as the "father of Danish ice hockey".
