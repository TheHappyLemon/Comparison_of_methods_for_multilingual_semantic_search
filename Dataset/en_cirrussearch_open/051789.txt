The Horyn or Haryn (Ukrainian: Горинь IPA: [ɦoˈrɪnʲ]; Belarusian: Гарынь IPA: [ɣaˈrɨnʲ]; Russian: Горы́нь, romanized: Goryn; Polish: Horyń) is a tributary of the Pripyat, which flows through Ukraine and Belarus. The Horyn is 659 kilometres (409 mi) long, and has a drainage basin of 27,700 square kilometres (10,700 sq mi). It has a maximum width of 80 m, and a maximum depth of 16 m. An important tributary of the Horyn River is the Sluch. The Horyn takes its source in the Ternopil Oblast of Ukraine, south of the city of Kremenets, located north of the administrative center of the Ternopil Oblast, Ternopil. The river then flows north, where it makes s-shaped formations, through the Ukrainian oblasts of Khmelnitsky and Rivne. The river then flows northeast into the Belarusian Brest Region, where it finally flows into the Pripyat. The Khmelnytskyi atomic power plant, located near the city of Netishyn, uses water from the Horyn for its cooling processes. Before the river was dammed, which created pollution, it was used for irrigation and fishing. A clean-up effort in September 1996 was a step towards the river's restoration. Cities and towns located on the river include Iziaslav, Slavuta, Netishyn, Ostroh, Dubrovytsia, Rechytsa, and Stolin.
