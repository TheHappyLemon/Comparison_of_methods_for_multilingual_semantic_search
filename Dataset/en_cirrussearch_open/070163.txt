Vyatka Governorate was an administrative-territorial unit (guberniya) of the Russian Empire and the Russian SFSR from 1796 to 1929, with its capital in Vyatka (now Kirov). The area of the governorate roughly corresponds to modern-day Kirov Oblast and Udmurtia. It was formed on territory of the historical lands of Vyatka (Latin: Veticiae).
