Laser diffraction analysis, also known as laser diffraction spectroscopy, is a technology that utilizes diffraction patterns of a laser beam passed through any object ranging from nanometers to millimeters in size to quickly measure geometrical dimensions of a particle. This particle size analysis process does not depend on volumetric flow rate, the amount of particles that passes through a surface over time.
