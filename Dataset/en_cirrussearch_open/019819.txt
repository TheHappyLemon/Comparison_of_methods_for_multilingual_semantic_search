Fulminic acid is an acid with the formula HCNO, more specifically H−C≡N+−O−. It is an isomer of isocyanic acid (H−N=C=O) and of its elusive tautomer, cyanic acid (H−O−C≡N), and also of isofulminic acid (H−O−N+≡C−). Fulminate is the anion [C−≡N+−O−] or any of its salts. For historical reasons, the fulminate functional group is understood to be −O−N+≡C− as in isofulminic acid; whereas the group −C≡N+O− is called nitrile oxide.
