A sovkhoz (Russian: совхо́з, IPA: [sɐfˈxos] , abbreviated from советское хозяйство, "sovetskoye khozyaystvo (sovkhoz)"; Ukrainian: радгосп, romanized: radhósp) was a form of state-owned farm in the Soviet Union. It is usually contrasted with kolkhoz, which is a collective-owned farm. Just as the members of a kolkhoz were called "kolkhozniks" or "kolkhozniki" (колхозники), the workers of a sovkhoz were called "sovkhozniki" (совхозники).
