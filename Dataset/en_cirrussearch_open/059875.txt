A heptomino (or 7-omino or septomino) is a polyomino of order 7; that is, a polygon in the plane made of 7 equal-sized squares connected edge to edge. The name of this type of figure is formed with the prefix hept(a)-. When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, there are 108 different free heptominoes. When reflections are considered distinct, there are 196 one-sided heptominoes. When rotations are also considered distinct, there are 760 fixed heptominoes.
