The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (also known as Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation) is a 1995 American slasher black comedy film written, co-produced, & directed by Kim Henkel. It is the fourth installment in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre film series. The film stars Renée Zellweger, Matthew McConaughey, and Robert Jacks. The plot follows four teenagers who encounter Leatherface and his murderous family in backwoods Texas on the night of their prom. It features cameo appearances from Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, and John Dugan, all stars of the original film. Principal photography took place on location in rural areas in Bastrop and Pflugerville, Texas, with a largely Austin-based cast and crew. The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre premiered at South by Southwest on March 12, 1995, and received a limited release in the United States on September 22, by Cinépix Film Properties. The following year, Columbia TriStar Pictures acquired distribution rights for both theatrical engagements as well as home media. The studio proceeded to re-edit the film and re-title it Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation before giving it a limited theatrical re-release on August 29, 1997. Between its two releases, the film was a box-office flop and received mixed reviews from critics, with some lauding its dark humor and nightmarish tone, while others criticized the coherence of its screenplay. Both contemporary and modern critics and film scholars have noted the film's prominent elements of parody and recursiveness, as well its unique implementation of a secret society subplot involving Leatherface and his family members. In the years since its release, the film has gone on to develop a cult following. Though a full soundtrack was never released, a companion single featured in the film performed by star Robert Jacks and Debbie Harry was released on compact disc in 1997.
