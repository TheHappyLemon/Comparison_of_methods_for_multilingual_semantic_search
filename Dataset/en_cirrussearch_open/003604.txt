The flag of the Central African Republic (French: Drapeau de la République centrafricaine; Sango: Bendêre tî Bêafrîka) was officially adopted in 1958. It has been retained since that time with the same design, four horizontal stripes of blue, white, green and yellow, and a single vertical band of red, with a yellow five-pointed star in the upper left corner.
