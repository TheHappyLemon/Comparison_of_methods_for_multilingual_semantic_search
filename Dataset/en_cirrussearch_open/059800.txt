Kamchatka Krai (Russian: Камча́тский край, romanized: Kamchatsky kray, IPA: [kɐmˈtɕatskʲɪj kraj]) is a federal subject of Russia (a krai), situated in the Russian Far East. It is administratively part of the Far Eastern Federal District. Its administrative center and largest city is Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, home to over half of its population of 291,705 (2021 Census). Kamchatka Krai was formed on 1 July 2007, as a result of the merger of Kamchatka Oblast and Koryak Autonomous Okrug, based on the voting in a referendum on the issue on 23 October 2005. The okrug retains the status of a special administrative division of the krai, under the name of Koryak Okrug. The Kamchatka Peninsula forms the majority of the krai's territory, separating the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea in the Pacific Ocean. The remainder is formed by a minor northern mainland portion, Karaginsky Island, and the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea. It is bordered by Magadan Oblast to the west and Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the north. Kamchatka Krai is an active volcanic zone that is home to Kluchevskaya, the highest active volcano in Eurasia, and the Decade Volcanoes of Avachinsky and Koryaksky.
