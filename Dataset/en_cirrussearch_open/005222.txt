Symptoms + Cures is the fourth studio album by Canadian hardcore punk band Comeback Kid. It was released on August 31, 2010. It's the band's first album released through Distort Entertainment after their previous record label Smallman Records went out of business. It's also distributed in the US through Victory Records. Symptoms + Cures was recorded with Eric Ratz and Kenny Luong, both of which have previously worked with the Canadian punk bands Cancer Bats and Billy Talent. The release is the second studio album to feature Andrew Neufeld as a vocalist after the 2007 album, Broadcasting.... Neufeld previously played guitar for Comeback Kid and only began to sing for the band after the former vocalist Scott Wade left in 2006.
