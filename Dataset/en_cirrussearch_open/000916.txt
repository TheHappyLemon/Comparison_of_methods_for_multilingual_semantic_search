The David Glacier (75°19′S 162°00′E﻿ / ﻿75.317°S 162.000°E﻿ / -75.317; 162.000) is a glacier over 60 nautical miles (110 km; 69 mi) long, flowing east from the polar plateau through the Prince Albert Mountains to the coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica. It enters Ross Sea between Cape Philippi and Cape Reynolds to form the floating Drygalski Ice Tongue. It is the most imposing outlet glacier in Victoria Land. It is fed by two main flows which drain an area larger than 200,000 square kilometres, with an estimated ice discharge rate of 7.8 +/- 0.7 km³/year. The David Glacier was discovered by Ernest Shackleton's "Northern Party," in November 1908, under the leadership of Prof. T.W. Edgeworth David, of Sydney University, for whom the feature was named.
