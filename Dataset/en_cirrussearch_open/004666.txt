Curd snack, cottage cheese bar or curd cheese bar is a type of sweet dairy food made from glazed or unglazed curd cheese with or without filling. They were created[citation needed] and became ubiquitous in the Soviet Union. Nowadays, curd snacks are popular in the former Soviet Union, such as the Baltic states, Russia and Ukraine, as well as in some former Soviet-aligned ones, such as Hungary (túró rudi), Poland, Romania and Mongolia.
