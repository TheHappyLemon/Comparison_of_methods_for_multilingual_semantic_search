"Au Revoir" is a song performed by German dance recording trio Cascada. It was produced by Yann Peifer and Manuel Reuter, who also co-wrote the song with Allan Eshuijs, for the band's fourth studio album Original Me (2011). The song serves as the second single (and third overall) from the album, on 23 September 2011 through Zooland Records in Germany. Musically, the song is a fast-paced electropop that features the use of Auto-Tune and bass instruments, and the lyrics are about being unimpressed with a man that presents himself as bigger than life. The song was met with generally positive reviews from critics, with the majority of them praising its experimental sound. "Au Revoir" peaked at number 73 on the German Singles Chart and at number 31 on the Austrian Singles Chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Lex Halaby and Lisa Mann, and choreographed by Luther Brown. The video's premise portrays Horler at a warehouse masquerade party.
