Jonathon Gary Frank Mirasty (born June 4, 1982) is a Cree native Canadian ice hockey player who has played in multiple professional leagues including the WHL, KHL, and AHL. Nicknamed "Nasty" by both teammates and fans, Mirasty developed a cult following throughout his career due to his Mohawk hairstyle and his laughing during his fights. Mirasty finished the 2010-11 regular season with the Fort Wayne Komets. However, he was left off the playoff roster. Mirasty, who weighs 220 pounds and stands five-foot-ten, had originally planned on retiring from hockey in 2006. After playing low-level pro-hockey, Mirasty was soon given a chance to play for the Syracuse Crunch of the AHL, a minor-league affiliate of the Columbus Blue Jackets, where he appeared in a number of NHL exhibition games while continuing to compete for the minor league team. Mirasty currently plays for Binghamton Black Bears of the FPHL. He made his acting debut as a hockey player in the television series Shoresy.
