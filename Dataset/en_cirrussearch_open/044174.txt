Constantine (/ˌkɒnstənˈtiːn/ KON-stən-TEEN) is a 2005 American superhero horror film directed by Francis Lawrence in his directorial debut. Written by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello from a story by Brodbin, it is loosely based on the DC Comics/Vertigo Comics Hellblazer graphic novels. The film stars Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, a cynical exorcist with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true forms and to travel between Earth and Hell. Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf, Tilda Swinton, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Djimon Hounsou, Gavin Rossdale, and Peter Stormare also feature. Constantine was released theatrically in the United States on February 18, 2005, and grossed $230.9 million worldwide against a production budget between $70–100 million. While it received mixed reviews from film critics, it has since garnered a cult following in the years following its release. In 2022, a sequel was announced and is currently in development.
