Garford-Putilov armoured cars were an armoured fighting vehicle produced in Russia during the First World War era. They were built on the chassis of Garford Motor Truck Co. lorries imported from the United States. Although considered to be a rugged and reliable machine by its users, the Garford-Putilov was severely underpowered. With a total weight of up to 11 tons, and only a 30 hp (22 kW) engine, the vehicles had a top speed of approximately 11–12 mph (18–19 km/h). The design was also top-heavy and therefore had very limited – if any – off-road capability. Armament consisted of a single 76.2 mm cannon in a turret with 270 degrees of traverse at the rear of the vehicle, and two or three 7.62 mm machine guns. Two of these machine guns were in casemate-like mounts towards the front of the vehicle, but the guns could not provide full frontal cover at short range. During its production from 1915 to 1916 the Putilov factory produced 48 of these armoured cars which were used during the First World War and the Russian Civil War. For their class and time Garfords possessed powerful weapons and adequate armour and despite their rather mediocre mobility Garfords were very effective in battle, distinguishing themselves in reliability and construction and giving them a comparatively long service life.
