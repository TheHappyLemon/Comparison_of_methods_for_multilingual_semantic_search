The flag of Liberia or the Liberian flag, sometimes called the Lone Star (not to be confused with "The Lone Star State", a nickname for Texas), bears a close resemblance to the flag of the United States, representing Liberia's founding by former black slaves from the United States and the Caribbean. They are both part of the stars and stripes flag family. The Liberian flag has similar red and white stripes, as well as a blue square with a white star in the canton. It was adopted on 24 August 1847.
