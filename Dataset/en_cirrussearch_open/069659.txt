Imus (Tagalog pronunciation: [ˈʔimus]), officially the City of Imus (Filipino: Lungsod ng Imus), is a 3rd class component city and de jure capital of the province of Cavite, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 496,794 people. It is the de jure capital of the province of Cavite, located 20 kilometers (12 mi) south of Metro Manila, when President Ferdinand Marcos decreed the transfer of the seat of the provincial government from Trece Martires on June 11, 1977. However, most offices of the provincial government are still located in Trece Martires. Imus was officially converted into a city following a referendum on June 30, 2012. Imus was the site of two major Katipunero victories during the Philippine Revolution against Spain. The Battle of Imus was fought on September 3, 1896, and the Battle of Alapan, on May 28, 1898, the day when the first Philippine flag was flown making Imus the "Flag Capital of the Philippines". Both events are celebrated annually in the city. The Imus Historical Museum honors the city's history with historical reenactment of scenes from the revolution.
