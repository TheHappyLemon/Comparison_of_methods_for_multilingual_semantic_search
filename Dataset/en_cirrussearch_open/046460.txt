The Kreenholm Manufacturing Company (historical alternate spelling: Krenholm; Estonian: Kreenholmi Manufaktuur; German: Krähnholm Manufaktur; Russian: Кренгольмская мануфактура) was a textile manufacturing company located on the river island of Kreenholm in the city of Narva, Estonia, near the border with Russia. It is situated along the banks of the Narva river, by the large Narva Falls, 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from the Baltic Sea. It was founded by Ludwig Knoop in 1857, a cotton merchant from Bremen, Germany. At one point, the company's cotton spinning and manufacturing mills were the largest in the world; and Kreenholm was considered in its time to be the most important mill of the former Russian Empire, owning 32,000 acres of land and employing 12,000 people. In 1872, the first labour strike in the history of Estonia, as well as one of the earliest labour strikes in all of the then Russian Empire. After the 1940 Soviet invasion and occupation of Estonia, the company's property was nationalised. Kreenholm's assets were privatised again in 1994, three years after Estonia had regained independence. The new company went bankrupt in 2010, and continued limited operations after purchase by the next set of owners (Kreenholmi Manufaktuur OÜ).
