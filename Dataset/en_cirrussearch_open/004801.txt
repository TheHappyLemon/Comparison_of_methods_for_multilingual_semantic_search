The Flatvaer Islands (Norwegian: Flatvær, meaning "flat islands"), also known as the Ongul Islands, are a group of small islands lying at the east side of the entrance of Lützow-Holm Bay, 4 km from the coastline of Antarctica. They were mapped by Norwegian cartographers from air photos taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition (LCE), 1936–37. Many of the islands and their features were subsequently named by members of the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE); unless otherwise noted, features noted in this article were named by JARE. The Flatvaer Islands are separated from Lützow-Holm Bay by Ongul Sound, which is 2 mi (3.2 km) wide and named in association with Ongul Island. On its east margin, opposite East Ongul Island, sits a small cluster of rocks called the Mukai Rocks. The name Mukai-iwa, meaning "facing rocks" or "opposite rocks," was given by JARE Headquarters in 1972.
