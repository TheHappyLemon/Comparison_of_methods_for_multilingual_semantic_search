The Most Honourable Order of the Bath is a British order of chivalry founded by King George I on 18 May 1725. The name derives from an elaborate medieval ceremony for preparing a candidate to receive his knighthood, of which ritual bathing (as a symbol of purification) was an element. While not all knights went through such an elaborate ceremony, knights so created were known as 'knights of the Bath', and likely from the upper classes to begin with. George I constituted the Knights of the Bath as a regular 'Military Order'. He did not revive the Order, which did not previously exist, in the sense of a body of knights governed by a set of statutes and whose numbers were replenished when vacancies occurred. The Order consists of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently King Charles III), the Great Master (vacant since 2023), and three Classes of members: Knight Grand Cross (GCB) or Dame Grand Cross (GCB) Knight Commander (KCB) or Dame Commander (DCB) Companion (CB) Members belong to either the Civil Division or the Military Division. Knight Companion (KB), the order's only class prior to 1815, is no longer an option. Recipients of the Order are now usually senior military officers or senior civil servants.Commonwealth citizens who are not subjects of the British monarch and foreign nationals may be made Honorary Members. The Order of the Bath is the fourth-most senior of the British orders of chivalry, after the Most Noble Order of the Garter, the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, and the Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick (dormant).
