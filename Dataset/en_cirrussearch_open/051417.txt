Karkonosze National Park (Polish: Karkonoski Park Narodowy) is a National Park in the Giant Mountains in the Sudetes in southwestern Poland, along the border with the Czech Republic. The national park is located in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in the highest part of the Sudetes. It was created in 1959, covering an area of 55.10 km2. Today it is slightly larger at 55.76 km2 (21.53 sq mi), of which 17.18 km2 is strictly protected. The majority of the park area, around 33.80 km2, consists of forests. In 1992 Karkonosze National Park, together with the neighbouring Czech Krkonoše National Park, became part of the Krkonoše/Karkonosze Transboundary Biosphere Reserve under UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme. Also, 40 hectares of peat bogs were designated a Ramsar international wetland site.
