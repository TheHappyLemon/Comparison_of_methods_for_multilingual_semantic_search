Sør-Trøndelag (Urban East Norwegian: [ˈsø̂ːˌtrœndəlɑːɡ] ; "South Trøndelag") was a county comprising the southern portion of the present-day Trøndelag county in Norway. It bordered the old Nord-Trøndelag ("North Trøndelag") county as well as the counties of Møre og Romsdal, Oppland, and Hedmark. To the west is the Norwegian Sea (Atlantic Ocean), and to the east is Jämtland in Sweden. The county was separated into a northern and southern part by the Trondheimsfjord. Slightly over 200,000 of the county's population (or around 55%) lives in the city of Trondheim and its suburbs. The Norwegian dialect of the region is Trøndersk. The region was divided into two administrative counties in 1804. In 2016, the two county councils voted to merge into a single county on 1 January 2018.
