Antônio Carlos Cerezo (born 21 April 1955), known as Toninho Cerezo (Brazilian Portuguese: [toˈniɲu sɛˈɾɛzu]), is a Brazilian former footballer. Cerezo is commonly regarded as one of the finest Brazilian defensive midfielders of all time, most notably having played for his hometown's team Atlético Mineiro; he also played for several other clubs in both Brazil and Italy throughout his career.
