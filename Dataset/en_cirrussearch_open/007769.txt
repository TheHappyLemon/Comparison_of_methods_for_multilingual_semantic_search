TNT (originally an abbreviation for Turner Network Television) is an American basic cable television channel owned by the Warner Bros. Discovery Networks unit of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) that launched on October 3, 1988. TNT's original purpose was to air classic films and television series to which Turner Broadcasting maintained spillover rights through its sister station TBS. Since June 2001, the network has shifted its focus to dramatic television series and feature films, along with some sporting events (including NBA, NHL, U.S. Soccer, the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and professional wrestling shows AEW Rampage and AEW Collision), as TBS shifted its focus to comedic programming. As of September 2018[update], TNT was received by approximately 89.573 million households that subscribe to a subscription television service throughout the United States. By June 2023, this number has dropped to 71.2 million households.
