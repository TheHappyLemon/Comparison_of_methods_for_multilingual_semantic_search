Proteinuria is the presence of excess proteins in the urine. In healthy persons, urine contains very little protein, less than 150Â mg/day; an excess is suggestive of illness. Excess protein in the urine often causes the urine to become foamy (although this symptom may also be caused by other conditions). Severe proteinuria can cause nephrotic syndrome in which there is worsening swelling of the body.
