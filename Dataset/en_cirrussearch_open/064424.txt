Al Khor (Arabic: الخور) is a coastal city in northern Qatar, located 50 kilometres north of the capital Doha. Considered one of Qatar's largest cities, it is the capital city of the municipality of Al Khor. The name of the city, meaning creek in Arabic, emerged because the original settlement was built on a creek. Al Khor is home to many employees of the oil industry due to its proximity to Qatar's northern oil and natural gas fields and to Ras Laffan Industrial City. It was also the venue for the opening game of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
