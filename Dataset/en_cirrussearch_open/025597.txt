The Nokia X platform was a Linux-based mobile operating system and software platform originally developed by Nokia, and subsequently by Microsoft Mobile. Introduced on 24 February 2014, it was forked from Android and used on all the devices of the Nokia X family. It was also the next Nokia Linux project after the ill-fated MeeGo. On 17 July 2014, after the acquisition of Nokia's devices unit, Microsoft announced that no more Nokia X smartphones would be introduced, marking the end of the Nokia X platform within only a few months after its introduction. The phones were succeeded by low-cost Lumia devices under the Microsoft Mobile brand name. Microsoft did not release an Android-based device under their own brand until 2020, in the form of the foldable Surface Duo.
