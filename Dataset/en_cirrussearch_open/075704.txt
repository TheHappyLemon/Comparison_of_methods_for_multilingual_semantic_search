The 1500 metres speed skating event was part of the speed skating at the 1924 Winter Olympics programme. The competition was held on Sunday, January 27, 1924. Twenty-seven speed skaters from ten nations were due to compete, but five athletes withdrew, so in the end twenty-two speed skaters from nine nations competed. The Finnish athlete Asser Wallenius fell and did not finish the race.
