Latvia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with the song "I Hear Your Heart" written by Andris Sējāns, Reinis Sējāns, Guntars Račs and Molly-Ann Leikin. The song was performed by the group Cosmos. The Latvian broadcaster Latvijas Televīzija (LTV) organised the national final Eirodziesma 2006 in order to select the Latvian entry for the 2006 contest in Athens, Greece. Twenty songs were selected to compete in the national final, which consisted of three shows: two semi-finals and a final. In the semi-finals on 4 and 11 February 2006, five entries were selected to advance from each show: three entries selected based on a public televote and two entries selected by a five-member jury panel. Ten songs ultimately qualified to compete in the final on 11 March 2006 where two rounds of public voting selected "I Hear Your Heart" performed by Cosmos as the winner. As one of the ten highest placed finishers in 2005, Latvia automatically qualified to compete in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Performing during the show in position 4, Latvia placed sixteenth out of the 24 participating countries with 30 points.
