Broadcast to the World is the sixth studio album released by American punk rock band Zebrahead. The album was influenced by Lit's A Place in the Sun (1999). It is their first album with new co-vocalist/rhythm guitarist Matty Lewis, who replaced former member Justin Mauriello after he left the group in late 2004. Shawn Harris of The Matches created the artwork for the album, and for the band's follow-up album, Phoenix.
