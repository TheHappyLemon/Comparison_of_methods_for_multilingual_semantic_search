Sambia (Russian: Самбийский полуостров, romanized: Sambiysky poluostrov, lit. 'Sambian Peninsula') or Samland (Russian: Земландский полуостров, romanized: Zemlandsky poluostrov, lit. 'Zemlandic Peninsula') or Kaliningrad Peninsula (official name, Russian: Калининградский полуостров, Kaliningradsky poluostrov) is a peninsula in the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, on the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea. The peninsula is bounded by the Curonian Lagoon to the north-east, the Vistula Lagoon in the southwest, the Pregolya River in the south, and the Deyma River in the east. As Sambia is surrounded on all sides by water, it is technically an island. Historically it formed an important part of the historic region of Prussia.
