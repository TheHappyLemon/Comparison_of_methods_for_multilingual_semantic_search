Sailing competitions at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo took place from 25 July to 4 August 2021 at the Enoshima Yacht Harbor in Enoshima. The venue was also used for the 1964 Olympic Games although significantly regenerated, the IOC now encouraging regeneration, cost reductions and sustainability. The RS:X, Laser, Laser Radial, Finn, 470, 49er, 49erFX, and Nacra17 are all returning for 2020; there are no significant changes to the Olympic programme from 2016.
