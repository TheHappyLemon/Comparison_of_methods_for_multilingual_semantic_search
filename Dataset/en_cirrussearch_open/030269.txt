The Nokia N93 is a mobile phone from Nokia, part of the multimedia Nseries. It was introduced on 25 April 2006 and released in July 2006. It runs on Symbian OS v9.1 and the S60 3rd Edition interface. It was the most advanced camera phone from Nokia at the time of its release, and was particularly marketed for its swivel design like its predecessor Nokia N90, which mimics the appearance of a conventional camcorder. The N93 improved upon camera capabilities over the N90. The phone has a 3.2-megapixel camera, Carl Zeiss optics and 3x optical zoom (the first Nokia phone to have it) as well as a 30 fps 640×480 (VGA) MPEG-4 video recording capability. It was succeeded by the Nokia N93i.
