The Czechoslovakia national basketball team (Czech: Československá basketbalová reprezentace, Slovak: Československé národné basketbalové mužstvo) represented Czechoslovakia in international basketball from 1932 to 1992. After the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia set up their own national teams. The present-day Czech Republic national basketball team is recognized as the successor to the Czechoslovak team.
