The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (Romanian: Partidul Comuniștilor din Republica Moldova, PCRM) is a communist party in Moldova led by Vladimir Voronin. It is the only communist party to have held a majority government in the post-Soviet states. It has been variously described as communist, Moldovenist, populist, Russophile, and pro-Soviet. Affiliated with the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it is also a member of the Party of the European Left and the International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties. In contrast to most like-minded left-wing and communist parties, especially in the Western world, the party has a conservative outlook on social issues, reflecting Voronin's views, the country's strong social conservatism, and the influence of the Moldovan Orthodox Church.
