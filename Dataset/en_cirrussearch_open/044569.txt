A mediterranean sea (/ˌmɛdɪtəˈreɪniən/ MED-i-tə-RAY-nee-ən) is, in oceanography, a mostly enclosed sea that has limited exchange of water with outer oceans and whose water circulation is dominated by salinity and temperature differences rather than by winds or tides. The eponymous Mediterranean Sea, for example, is almost completely enclosed by Asia, Europe, and Africa.
