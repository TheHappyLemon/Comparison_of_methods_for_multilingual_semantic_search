Janko Matúška (10 January 1821 – 11 January 1877) was an ethnic Slovak poet, activist, occasional playwright, and clerk of the court in the Kingdom of Hungary. He is best known as the author of the Slovak national anthem, "Nad Tatrou sa blýska" ("Lightning over the Tatras"), based on the melody of a Slovak folk song, "Kopala studienku".
