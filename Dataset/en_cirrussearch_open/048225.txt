Tantalum pentoxide, also known as tantalum(V) oxide, is the inorganic compound with the formula Ta 2O 5. It is a white solid that is insoluble in all solvents but is attacked by strong bases and hydrofluoric acid. Ta 2O 5 is an inert material with a high refractive index and low absorption (i.e. colourless), which makes it useful for coatings. It is also extensively used in the production of capacitors, due to its high dielectric constant.
