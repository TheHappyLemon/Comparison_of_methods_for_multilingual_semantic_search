A chernomyrdinka (Russian: Черномы́рдинка; plural: Черномы́рдинки) or a chernomyrdinism is a quotation, often a malapropism or a gaffe, attributed to the former Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Many of them entered the everyday Russian lexicon. The most famous example is "We wanted the best, but it turned out as always", uttered in the context of Russia's efforts in economic reforms, namely the monetary reform in Russia, 1993. Chernomyrdin did not try to be smart, chernomyrdinkas were produced naturally. Even when they sounded funny, people have found a deeper meaning in them. They were produced after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when country leadership, including Chernomyrdin, attempted to speak "not from the paper sheet" (in other words, not in a scripted fashion) and without bureaucratisms typical of the late Soviet Union. Russian journalist Dmitry Travin [ru] writes that chernomyrdinkas often reflected the spirit of the epoch better than thick books of writers and philosophers. Russian writer and satirist Victor Shenderovich is quoted to say that he envies Chernomyrdin: a writer toils hard, but Chernomyrdin just opens his mouth, and here you go: a brilliant quote is here. The Orenburg gas processing plant [ru], whose first director was Chernomyrdin, on the occasion of its 45th anniversary opened a park dedicated to Chernomyrdin and adorned it with plaques with chernomyrdinkas.
