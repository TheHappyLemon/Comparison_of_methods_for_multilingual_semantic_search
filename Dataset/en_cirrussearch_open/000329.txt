Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Swedish pronunciation: [skandɪˈnɑ̌ːvɪska ˈêːnˌɧɪlːda ˈbǎŋːkɛn]), abbreviated SEB, is a Swedish bank headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. In Sweden and the Baltic countries, SEB has a full financial service offering. In Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany, and the United Kingdom, the bank's operations are focused on corporate and investment banking services to corporate and institutional clients. The bank was founded in 1972 by the Swedish Wallenberg family, which is still SEB's largest shareholder through major investment company Investor AB. SEB is the largest Swedish bank by both market capitalisation and total assets. The SEB Group traces its origins to the Stockholms Enskilda Bank and Skandinaviska Banken, established in 1856 and 1864 respectively. Both banks played an important role in Scandinavia's industrialisation throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially in Sweden. After a period of strong growth throughout the twentieth century, Stockholms Enskilda Bank and Skandinaviska Banken merged in 1972 to form the SEB Group. SEB's German and Baltic subsidiaries, being located in eurozone countries, have been designated as Significant Institutions since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence are directly supervised by the European Central Bank.
