"Rosenrot" (German for "Rose-red") is a song by German industrial metal band Rammstein. It was released on 16 December 2005, as the second single from the band's album of the same name. The song was highly anticipated by fans of Rammstein, as it was first hailed in February 2004 to be the first single from the band's fourth studio album, Reise, Reise (the song "Mein Teil" took the honour instead).
