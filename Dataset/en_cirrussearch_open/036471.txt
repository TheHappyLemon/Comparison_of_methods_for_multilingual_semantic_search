The City University of Applied Sciences (German: Hochschule Bremen) is a public Fachhochschule, a University of Applied Sciences, located in Bremen, Germany. In 1982, this University evolved from the fusion of four Universities of Applied Sciences: the Universities for technology, business, social pedagogy and social economy, and nautics. The history of the City University of Applied Sciences traces back to the foundation of the Technikum, a School for Civil Engineering and Shipping in 1894 and the foundation of the Social Women's' School, the first School of Social Work in Bremen in 1918. Hochschule Bremen is a member of the UAS7 (Seven Universities of Applied Sciences) network that forms a strategic alliance of seven leading German Universities of Applied Sciences in teaching and research.
