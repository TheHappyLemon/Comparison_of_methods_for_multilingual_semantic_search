A pine is any conifer tree or shrub in the genus Pinus (/ˈpaɪnuːs/) of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae. World Flora Online, created by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and Missouri Botanical Garden, accepts 187 species names of pines as current, together with more synonyms. The American Conifer Society (ACS) and the Royal Horticultural Society accept 121 species. Pines are commonly found in the Northern Hemisphere. Pine may also refer to the lumber derived from pine trees; it is one of the more extensively used types of lumber. The pine family is the largest conifer family, and there are currently 818 named cultivars (or trinomials) recognized by the ACS. It is also a well-known type of Christmas tree.
