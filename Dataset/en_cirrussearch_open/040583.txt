Fotbal Club Viitorul Constanța (Romanian pronunciation: [vi.iˈtorul konˈstantsa]), commonly known as Viitorul Constanța or simply Viitorul, was a Romanian professional football club based in Ovidiu, Constanța County. They last played their home matches in blue and black kits at the Stadionul Viitorul, situated a few kilometres north of the city of Constanța. Founded in 2009 by Gheorghe Hagi, the team was particularly known for promoting young talents from its academy, which earned them the nickname "Hagi's Kids". With the former Romanian international also acting as a coach, Viitorul Constanța had its first major success in the 2016–17 campaign, when it became the first side from the region of Dobruja to win the national title. Two years later, it also won the Romanian Cup and the Romanian Supercup. In June 2021, owner Gheorghe Hagi, chairman Gheorghe Popescu and Farul Constanța owner Ciprian Marica announced in a press conference that their two clubs have merged; second division club Farul Constanța therefore took Viitorul's berth in the first league from the 2021–22 Liga I season.
