Aasiaat Airport (Greenlandic: Mittarfik Aasiaat) (IATA: JEG, ICAO: BGAA) is an airport located in the Disko Bay, 1 NM (1.9 km; 1.2 mi) northeast of Aasiaat, a town in the Qeqertalik municipality in western Greenland. It can serve STOL aircraft, although there is no aircraft deicing equipment at the airport, which is costly and problematic in Greenlandic winter.
