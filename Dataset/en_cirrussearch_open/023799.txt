Krasnodon (Ukrainian and Russian: Краснодон) or Sorokyne (Ukrainian: Сорокине; Russian: Сорокино, romanized: Sorokino) is a city in Luhansk Oblast, eastern Ukraine. Located in the Donbas region, it is part of Dovzhansk Raion. Its population is approximately 42,315 (2022 estimate). Krasnodon came under control of pro-Russian separatists in early 2014, and was incorporated into the Luhansk People's Republic (LNR). Since then, it has been continually controlled by the LNR, and since 2022, explicitly by Russia.
