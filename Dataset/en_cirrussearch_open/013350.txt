"Truly Madly Deeply" is a song by Australian pop duo Savage Garden, released in March 1997 as the third single from their self-titled debut album (1997) by Roadshow and Warner Music. It won the 1997 ARIA Music Award for both Single of the Year and Highest Selling Single and was nominated for Song of the Year. Written by bandmates Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones, the song is a reworking of a song called "Magical Kisses" that the pair wrote together during the recording of their debut album. The song reached No. 1 in Australia, Canada, and the United States; in the latter country, Billboard ranked it the most successful song of all time on their Adult Contemporary chart. Two music videos were filmed for the track: one for its original Australian release and another for the international market, shot in Paris, France. In November 2019, the song was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's selection of recordings. The songs added to the list provide a snapshot of Australian life and have "cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance and relevance".
