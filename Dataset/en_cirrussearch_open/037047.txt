The 2017 Tour of Flanders (Dutch: Ronde van Vlaanderen 2017) was the 101st edition of the Tour of Flanders, a one-day cycling classic, that took place on 2 April 2017. It was the second monument race of the 2017 cycling season and the thirteenth event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. The race marked the pinnacle of the Flemish Cycling Week. The race was won by Belgian national champion Philippe Gilbert from the Quick-Step Floors team, after a solo attack on the Oude Kwaremont and holding off the rest of the field over the remaining 55 kilometres (34 mi). Second place went to another Belgian, Greg Van Avermaet of the BMC Racing Team, beating Dutch riders Niki Terpstra (Quick-Step Floors) and Dylan van Baarle from Cannondale–Drapac in a three-up sprint finish for the podium placings.
