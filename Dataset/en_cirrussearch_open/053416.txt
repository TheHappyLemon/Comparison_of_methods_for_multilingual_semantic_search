Julian Nagelsmann (born 23 July 1987) is a German professional football coach who is currently the manager of the Germany national team. He has previously managed TSG Hoffenheim, RB Leipzig and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. Born in Bavaria, Nagelsmann retired as a footballer at age 20 after a succession of injuries. In 2010, he began his coaching career as a youth coach at TSG Hoffenheim, eventually coaching their first team in 2015, where he led them to a third-place finish in the Bundesliga and Champions League qualification. He departed Hoffenheim in 2019 and was appointed at fellow Bundesliga club RB Leipzig, reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League in 2020. Nagelsmann was appointed by Bayern Munich in 2021 for a world record managerial transfer worth €25 million (£21.7 million), making him the most expensive manager ever. He won the Bundesliga title in his debut season, but was dismissed as manager from the club in March 2023. In September 2023, he was appointed as the coach of the Germany national team on a short-term contract until the conclusion of UEFA Euro 2024.
