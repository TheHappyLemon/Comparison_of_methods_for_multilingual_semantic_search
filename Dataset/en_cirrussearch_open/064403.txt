Alex Nicolao Telles (Brazilian Portuguese: [aˈlɛks ˈtɛlis]; born 15 December 1992) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a left-back for Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Brazil national team. Telles started his career at Brazilian Série D side Juventude, before being sold to Série A side Grêmio in 2013. That year, he was voted the best left-back in the league. In January 2014, Telles signed with Turkish Süper Lig club Galatasaray, winning various trophies including a league title, two Turkish Cups and the Turkish Super Cup, only to be loaned to Serie A team Inter Milan during the 2015–16 season. In July 2016, Telles was sold to Primeira Liga side FC Porto, where he established himself as one of the best left-backs in the league. He made almost 200 appearances for Porto and won four trophies, including two league titles, one Taça de Portugal and one Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira, as well as being named in the Primeira Liga Team of the Year for three consecutive seasons. Telles' performances sparked the interest of several European clubs, and in October 2020, he signed for Manchester United for an initial €18 million (£15.4 million). Born in Brazil, Telles also holds Italian citizenship, but ended up representing Brazil at international level. He made his senior international debut in 2019.
