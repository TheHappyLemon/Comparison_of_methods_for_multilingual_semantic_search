Emporis was a real estate data mining company with headquarters in Hamburg, Germany. The company collected data and photographs of buildings worldwide, which were published in an online database from 2000 to September 2022. On 12 September 2022, the managing director of CoStar Europe posted a letter on Emporis.com, informing its community members of the decision which had been made to retire the Emporis community platform, effective 13 September 2022. Emporis offered a variety of information on its public database, Emporis.com. Emporis was frequently cited by various media sources as an authority on building data. Emporis originally focused exclusively on high-rise buildings and skyscrapers, which it defined as buildings "between 35 and 100 metres" tall and "at least 100 metres tall", respectively. Emporis used the point where the building touches the ground to determine height. The database had expanded to include low-rise buildings and other structures. It used a point system to rank skylines.
