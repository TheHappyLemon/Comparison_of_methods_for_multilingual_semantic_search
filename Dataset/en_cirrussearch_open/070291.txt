The World Team Challenge is an international biathlon competition, which has been held every year between Christmas and New Year since 2002 in Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen. Previously a similar competition was held at the same time of year in Ruhpolding, but since 2001 the venue was changed due to financial troubles. The competition isn't part of the World Cup.
