Spain's Rafael Nadal defeated Chile's Fernando González in the final, 6–3, 7–6(7–2), 6–3 to win the gold medal in men's singles at the 2008 Summer Olympics. The win gave him the third of five components of the career Golden Slam, having already won the French Open and Wimbledon. He would go on to win the Australian Open and the US Open to become the second man (after Andre Agassi) to complete the career Golden Slam in singles. Following the event, Nadal became the world No. 1 for the first time, ending Roger Federer's record streak of 237 consecutive weeks with the top ranking. González became the first man to win a medal in men's singles across consecutive Olympiads since Charles Winslow in 1920. In the bronze medal match, Serbia's Novak Djokovic defeated the United States' James Blake, 6–3, 7–6(7–4). It was Serbia's first Olympic tennis medal. The tournament was held from August 10 to August 17 at the Olympic Green Tennis Centre in Beijing, China. The DecoTurf surface rendered the event a hardcourt competition. There were 64 players from 33 nations. Chile's Nicolás Massú was the reigning gold medalist from 2004. He lost to Argentina's David Nalbandian in the second round.
