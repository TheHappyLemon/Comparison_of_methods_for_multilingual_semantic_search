The Ranks and insignia of the Latvian National Armed Forces are the military insignia used by the Latvian National Armed Forces. Historically the Land Forces wore collar insignia. Today shoulder boards are worn by almost all personnel of the NAF, save for the Staff Battalion, which uses a modified form of the old collar insignia.
