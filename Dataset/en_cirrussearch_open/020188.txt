Chimborazo (Spanish pronunciation: [tʃimboˈɾaso] ) is an inactive stratovolcano situated in the Cordillera Occidental range of the Andes. Its last known eruption is believed to have occurred around 550 A.D. Despite not being the tallest mountain in the Andes or on Earth, its summit holds the distinction of being the farthest point on Earth's surface from the Earth's center, due to its location along the planet's equatorial bulge. Chimborazo's height is 6,263 m (20,548 ft), well below that of Mount Everest (8,849 m). Chimborazo is the highest mountain in Ecuador and ranks as the 39th highest peak in the entire Andes. The mountain is a popular destination for mountaineering due to its challenging climbing routes, which involve traversing snow, ice, and rocky terrain. Climbers often need specialized gear like crampons and technical climbing equipment to tackle its routes.
