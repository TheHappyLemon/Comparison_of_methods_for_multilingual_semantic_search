Gvadalkanalas kauja jeb Gvadalkanalas kampaņa bija kauja starp sabiedroto un japāņu spēkiem, kas norisinājās no 1942. gada 7. augusta līdz 1943. gada 9. februārim Otrā pasaules kara Klusā okeāna teātrī. Gvadalkanala kampaņa bija daļa no sabiedroto stratēģiskā plāna aizsargāt okeāna konvoju maršrutus starp ASV, Austrāliju un Jaunzēlandi un beidzās ar sabiedroto uzvaru. Gvadalkanalas kauju bieži dēvē par Klusā okeāna reģiona kauju pagrieziena punktu, jo tā iezīmēja Japānas stratēģiskās iniciatīvas galīgo zaudēšanu un sabiedroto pāreju no aizsardzības uz ofensīvu.
